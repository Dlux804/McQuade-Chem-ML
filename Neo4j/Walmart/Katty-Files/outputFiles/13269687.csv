"I am a senior with sensitive skin-I have been using this product daily for about 10 days (newcomer to Roc products) this has been a treat to my skin-I am noticing more even skin tone, less dryness (flaky) skin, lines less noticeable. Does not feel greasy as it soaks into the skin leaving a soft moist feel. I am very pleased with this moisturizer. By the way it does not burn my sensitive skin ( no redness nor tingling sensation) I purchased at my local Walmart-will be adding more Roc products to my skin care regiment. Thanks ROC"
I think it's funny but the lady saying that didn't help her deep wrinkles she uses it for two weeks and there is no change nothing works in less than two weeks nothing you can get those wrinkles in two weeks and you something for couple of months three months at least if you don't see a difference then I would get rid of it but at the very least 30 to 60 days police 30 please give it a month
I've been using this product for 10 years as part of my daily skincare regimen. No one guesses my age.....
"works really well. Now that I'm over 50 and spending more time in the sun, it's time to add to the regimen As my skin is changing. ROC products are great. While others are getting on the retinol bandwagon, ROC has been leading."
"I am 57 years old and grew up in CA. when sun bathing was the thing to do. I damaged my skin severely! Ten or more years ago I knew I had to start doing something and read up on this product, it was very affordable so I started using it. I also use the ROC night cream and the retinol serum. Today my skin is beautiful. I highly recommend it!!"
"Everyone saying there is not retinol in it need to do their research. Active ingredients only refer to drugs. Inactive ingredients do not literally mean inactive. Retinol is never going to be on an active ingredient list. Do not take ""inactive"" literally. Retinol is in the list of ingredients . Also, love this product."
Great product that i use and best price anywhere.
"I have been using this for years, I am over 50 .I have very sensitive skin. This absorbs well, with great results and I have never had an adverse effect. Please don't ever change this !!"
Small wrinkles and deep wrinkles are both better. An acquaintance asked me yesterday.what I use on my face so I guess that's a good sign.
"I started using this product many years ago when The Today Show named it the best daily moisturizer on the market for that year. I wear it under my foundation everyday. I grew up in Southern California and by the age of 18 probably had a lifetime worth of exposure to the sun! I now am 72 years old and in the past year total strangers have guessed my age as 53! My skin is the average T-Zone oily to dry skin, that gets a little less oily every year."
I switched to this daily moisturizer about 6 months ago from a pricier department store brand and never looking back! Within 4 weeks my face seemed to have 30% fewer fine lines and was plumped and smooth! I just recently added the Roc serum and Eye cream to my routine. Cant wait to see how they work. I've heard the layering of the 3 in a daily routine are transformative to agin skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using ROC Deep wrinkle daily moisturizer together with ROC eye cream for well over 10 years, and nobody believes that I'm 60 yrs old. It was a chuckle when the cashier gently reminded me of the age requirement for the senior discount at the local grocery store - she said she'd guessed me in the 40's. I've tried a few other skin creams over the years but I always come back to ROC because it absorbs so cleanly and really leaves my skin smooth and soft. I'm never going to stop using this stuff."
"As a 32 y/o male, I noticed a pronounced forehead wrinkle and and one on the side of my mouth which I find annoying since I eat keto, take collagen protein, astaxanthan, vitamin e & c for a while yet and none of that has helped with my face. I've been using the day and night products for two weeks now after some initial sensitivity, the lines are going away which is awesome. Two things I ask are to reformulate the products without scents and reduce the amount of shininess with the daytime product."
"When I turned 45 all my former skin care regiments seemed useless. My skin was looking dry, dull, and uneven. RoC has been a game changer; in short less effort and cost, with greater visible results. My skin glows with hydration, spots have disappeared and uneven redness has neutralized. It looks so good I rarely wear make up now and regularly receive comments regarding my skin."
"Roc has been my only skin care regimen for 20+ years. At 62 and a former smoker, my skin is still smoother than most 50 year old women. I don't spend a lot of time on maintenance, but the eye cream and the day, and the night creams are the one thing I always adhere to. This regimen only adds a minute or 2 to your daily routine and the results are as good as anything you'd pay 2 or 3 times as much for. I'd love it if they would make a tinted BB cream. I'd be their most loyal customer!"
"I am curious about a previous reviewer's question to you as to whether your Retinol Correxion cream actually includes Retinol, since it doesn't say it does on the tube. The only claim that is made on the tube, and ""use"" described, is that it is a sunscreen."
I have extremely sensitive skin so I need to be careful with facial moisturizers. So many have left me with a bad reaction except this ! I received a bottle of ROC daily moisturizing lotion in one of my monthly subscription boxes and its changed my life ! This lotion is simply amazing and smells so great. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth as well as looking younger .My skin feels and looks firmer plus my dark spots are fading . ROC is FABULOUS !!!
"I have a hard time finding not only something that will not irritate my skin but also feel and look good. I FOUND IT in RoC 5 in 1!!!! I don't usually spend a lot for myself, but I was desperate to find something that did not make me break out or itch. So I tried it.....LOVED IT.... and was able to get my mother to try it. We don't look our ages and would like to keep it that way. THANK YOU!!!!!"
"My skin has improved. I have used four bottles so far and in all of them the pump stops working half way, so you must take the cream out with your fingers, it's messy. I would strongly recommend they do something about the way the pump works.This is a good product but please change container."
"I did not feel I got good results from this product. I used 3/4 of the tube, but the strong perfume smell bothered me and I had a burning sensation on my skin and I am usually not sensitive to facial products. I threw the remainder out and went to an Oil of Olay product."
"These bad reviews had me skeptical, but my combination skin has left me a mess, oily t-zone, dry every where else, and discoloration too! Obviously some people's skin won't agree with it... that goes for any product!! My skin flairs at everything I've tried until now!! Using it daily going on my 6th week, my skin is evening out, pores smaller, and hydrated where it needs to be without making me oily at all!! Even seems to help even out my combination spots, haven't had any breakout with it. LOVING IT FULLY!"
"I have been a user of the ROC night cream for years and bought a Day/Night kit. BAD decision. The first day was fine for the day cream, but the 2nd day using, I had a bad allergic reaction -probably the sun screen part. Small blisters around my mouth area, itching and tingling (chemical burn). Be careful if you have had reactions to sunscreen before!"
"My daughter who is very Up on really good products recommended the RoC 5 in 1 series to me. I know there's no magic bullet in this world but this product comes as close as anything will. We are lucky to begin with and have never looked our ages (good genes) but RoC has raised our confidence level considerably. Thank you for a fine product, I'm a believer.Snookie"
"FYI..This is my first time using a product for aging skin. I noticed that my skin was becoming dry and dull, and my neck looked a little...loose. I took a leap and bought the product and couldn't be happier. My skin is glowing! My daughter commented that my complexion looked very soft and smooth. I've noticed that the skin on my neck looks nicer too. I will definitely buy more products and create a new skincare regimen!"
I read the two negative reviews. I am thinking that I have had none of the complaints that the two had. I have used Roc Deep Wrinkle Nite cream and Roc Deep Wrinkle Daily cream for years. I have had nice compliments and many times told that I look younger than my almost 75 years. I am anxious to try the Roc Multi Correxion Life anti Gravity cream which I just read about.
"People younger than fifty years old must be the ones leaving all the super high ratings on this product. One would think a product like this would be designed for those who actually need it the most. Well, I'm over fifty and this cream did nothing for my neck or chest. The cream itself is thick and sticky and all it did was accentuate my fine line and wrinkles making them look worse. I didn't dare put it on my face! My neck and chest still felt and looked dry after almost a month of using this product."
"I didn't realize it was a tiny, tiny tube and they said t apply it liberaly every day. If I did it would last two days. Two much money for such a small tube and it said on the instructions it is for the sun. I needed something strictly as a mosturizer. Thank you"
I was excited to try this product as I have done my research and read many positive reviews. My skin unfortunately reacted as some other reviewers on here after a few days of use and became irritated and itchy aging with having an bumpy uneven texture. It almost feels as if I have a slight sunburn. I'm disappointed as I feel like my money has gone to waste. I wish I had a better review. I was so hopeful this would works for me.
"I'm allergic to zinc so my moisture with sunscreens are limited. I decided to try this while I waited for my regular Roc daily moisturizer to arrive. Mistake. I had the same reaction of red, inflamed, burning skin. I stopped using after two days, waited for my face to calm down and tried it again. Immediate burning so I washed it off. This one is not for me. I'm glad Roc hasn't discontinued the regular daily moisturizer."
"I really wanted a good moisturizer that helps with fine lines due to aging. I've been using roC eye cream and wanted to try this. My face became red with hives and itchy. Although I love the roC products in the gold tunes and use them daily, the ones in blue I am a little afraid to try. If you have make up allergies, I do not recommend this. But if you've not had problems with facial creams, I have confidence in roC's products."
"After reading in a women's magazine and having some friends who recommend it, I decided to give it a try.thats I used it for 2 days and my face became red and itchy and I developed small clear fluid filled blisters on my face, specially in my forehead. I stopped using it and I hope they will go away."
"I 've been using this moisturizer for a year, my skin really glows, and added bonus is the sun screen in it. I have very sensitive skin so I was skeptical in trying it. Glad I did, and people can't believe I'm as old as I am. I would definitely recommend it. Susie"
"Ive been using the night and eye retinol creams with no problems and needed a day cream. So I tried the 5 in 1 multi correction. To my dissapointment i was sporting a hot, red, itchy rash on my face and neck for almost 3 days. It finally went away but Ive been left with a dry scaly patch in my neck. So dry it even flaked. To me it also had a stronger Sunscreen smell than other creams Ive tried in the past too."
Wish it had turned out better. Shoppers beware!
This product makes your skin look very silky and smooth. Have been using for almost 2 years now and love it! My skin has a youthful glow now. I am 45 years old and spent a lot of my younger years in the sun without sunscreen and the difference is noticeable to all my friends.
"I excitedly purchased the Multi Correction 5 in 1 Daily Moisturizer after reading a promising endorsement in a favorite magazine. So disappointed when, on day 2, I immediately experienced an painful, itchy, heated rash on applied area. I washed it off but, 24 hours later, the hive-like rash has not gone away. I currently use the ROC Deep Wrinkle Night cream and will continue to do so."
"This would be such an amazing product if it weren't for the HORRIFIC smell. The scent of this cream is its downfall. It's a heavy heavy scent, that gave me a huge headache and made me nauseous! I had to rewash my face after applying this on my face."
"Just super regret buying this, and wish I could return it."
"Such a great product. Works wells or my dry skin. I use to try and reduce the fine line wrinkles I already have, and also to prevent anymore from forming. It also offers some protection from the sun. Which will later prevent more wrinkles from forming."
I've been using this for years works beautifully I'm 58 years old and I look 10 years younger can't say enough good things about Roc! I have tried more expensive products and tend to always come back to this one I highly recommend. Wish people would click their age range when reviewing a product makes no sense if we don't know how old you are.
"I had been using Elizabeth Arden for more than 20 years, but Elizabeth Arden changed its products many times and it turns out that the one I was using DOESN'T HAVE PROPER SUN PROTECTION! I should have known after seeing my gigantic black spots... Anyway, what I want to say is that ROC multicorrexion 5 in 1 daily moisturizer IS AMAZING, AND IT IS HALF THE PRIZE! I highly HIGHLY recommend this cream."
I have been using this product for just 4 days and already see improvement. One side of my face is developing some nasty wrinkles. I started using this and put on every few hours and the deep wrinkles are disappearing!! I have not been using this long term but I am excited about see what happens in the 12 weeks. I am very pleased. Any by the way if it separates like the reviews below say store it lid down and shake it.
"I have used Roc products with Retinol for years and believe they are the best-even a top grade beautician for a very big company admitted it was the best to me when I refused her advances! Yes, it does separate sometimes but any benefits outweigh that slight inconvenience, especially when one is told over and over what a lovely complexion one has"
"though I haven't used this brand at all, after tryin everything out there up too 1000.00$ night cream, Tonight December 30th 2017I have started my ROC products. I even took a picture of my face and boy oh boy does it need work. I turn 65 in less than 2 weeks. Even though I have been told I don't look like I'm close to 60, and that came from my primary And I will be honest I don't want to look my birth age I want to be my best self at my birth age. After all, this is methods! I have one week to see if this works, here goes"
"I cannot start the day without this product. My skin feels instantly renewed, glowing as soon as I apply it! In the summer I don't even need to wear foundation...a nice summer tan and this moisturizer are all I need! The product truly delivers value for the price paid. I have oily skin, this product is non-greasy, absorbs quickly, and sinks right into my skin like a drink of water for my pores!"
"After becoming concerned about the effects of the outdoors on my skin, I tried the 5 in 1 and began seeing the results very soon thereafter. My skin became radiant but not overly oily and I could feel an evident change in the soft yet firm skin texture. I live in a tropical island and love the outdoors. Now I feel more confident to have a reliable product that I can use without a weighty feel. I'd be getting more items from this product line."
"I've been using this for over 1 month now. My skin is soft, supple & hydrated, also appears plumper with fine lines much softer. My skin has a glow about it. I am also using a serum underneath this daily. Highly recommend Roc products & am using a number of them. Does not leave skin dry."
"Love this stuff! Have used for 14 months. From day one it's felt great on my face! I am a very active 66 year old, working and outdoors all the time. The other day I told 2 ladies on the bus that I have a senior citizen pass. The look on their faces told the story- and then they both blurted out ""you certainly don't look it""."
"As with any product (even high end very expensive ones) you take your risks when purchasing - even expensive ones sometimes brake you out. I have acne prone skin and for me this product after two weeks of use (my personal trial period) has done nothing but make my skin look great. Where i live is hot and humid which with some creams increases your chance of getting break outs - not with this one, at least not for me. SUMMARY- i think it's great."
"I received a free sample at a local chain drugstore and have tried this for several days. The fragrance is too noticeable and precludes my purchasing this. However, it does leave a smooth surface on the skin - if it was fragrance free I would consider giving this a try. I have not had any reaction to the ingredients."
I have been using for 6 months now and I like it. I use the Roc retinol correxion deep wrinkle set at night and this day cream for the day. I am 33 and look 25 but I have small fine lines around eyes that I've seen reduced in the last 6 months. I don't think anything turns back the clock but this is a nice pause button.
"I was really looking forward to trying a Roc product for the first time because I had heard great things. But after the third day of using this product, my skin started to turn red, burn, and itch. I am surprised and disappointed. I would like a refund."
"I love ROC products but this one gave me a raised rash that was red, itchy and burning on my cheeks and forehead. I'm not sure why. I have used all types of products with retinol and vitamin C and never had this reaction. I am disappointed because it sounded so promising and love the SPF 30."
"Hi, I was looking forward to trying RoC® MULTI CORREXION® 5 in 1 Daily Moisturizer for a long time. I'm a man and I usually sport facial hair. I was disappointed in this product for two reasons: (1) the product left a white residue in my beard stubble which is very short at the present time and (2) it had a very feminine scent. The residue doesn't go away unless I wipe off the product. I wish I could get my money back. :-( I will add that I've used the other retinol products and I swear by them."
I am 34 yr old female. I love this ROC moisturizer! I have very fine lines under my eyes & a small smile line that have not gone away with this product but it hydrates my skin so well & evens out my skin tone so good! When I run out & use other things I definitely notice a difference in my complection. It makes my skin brighter & more even skin tone. I love it! I have ordered Renova online for my fine lines & I must cont. this product also! Ever since trying it I can't live without it!
I am 34yrs old. I don't get break outs/ acne often. I used this product for 2 weeks and it caused me to break out/acne !!! :-(. I stopped using the product for 1 week and used cleansing products and creams to get rid of the acne. The acne cleared up. I still had faith in the product so I tried it again. AND AGAIN THE ACNE CAME. :-( It was a waste of $$. I would like to know how I can get my $$ back. I will be calling the customer service on Monday . I liked the texture of the lotion but it is too oily.
"Really like this product. I've been using the retinal corrector about six months. I love how my skin feels and look. I've used origins, ambi,neutrogina, and their all good products' but didn't notice any real changes on my skin. The daily moisturizer works well on my face and neck without feeling sticky. Roc has great products. I will use the cleansing disc next..."
Totally love ROC! I've been using it for years. I switched to neutrogena about 6 months ago and as soon as I was out went back to ROC. This product works the best of all of them. It only took about 4-5 days before I noticed my skin improving. I can see the fine lines disappear shortly after starting use.
I am 38 years old and have had trouble with other sunscreen products either being too heavy or too irritating to my skin because of smell or ingredients. I now only exclusively use this as my go to sunscreen. It probably isn't for everybody but for me it works and I would say it is comparable to higher end products that I have used before.
"I have been using the Retinol Correxion moisturizer for a week and have noticed that it is not sinking into my skin and eventually ""pills-up"" and rolls off. What am I doing wrong?"
I have been enjoying Roc products over 20 years but have a concerns with the Daily Moisturizer. Why is the oil separating from the cream when I have used 1/2 tube. This has happened for the last 3 tubs I've purchased. Thank you for your help.
"Whatever is in this made my eczema kick in terribly. I had red blotches, had to take allergy meds to stop the itching. It is NOT for sensitive skin. At this price, I was very disappointed."
My eyes will not stop watering with this product. Tried it three different days and the same thing happened and I'm not using it near my eyes. Is there retinol in this product? It's not listed in the ingredients.
ROC Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer is a perfectly adequate sunscreen.
"However, all the advertising is misleading, as the 4 listed ingredients are sunscreens. I can find no listing of a retinol ingredient."
I have been able to notice an overall improvement in the wrinkles in my forehead and side of eyes! When I rub it in on the morning my face feels hydrated and smooth. Love love it!
"I am 55 yrs old. Been using ROC Multi-Correxion 5-1 for a year now. I love it. It has improved my skin, been told I look younger than my age. It did diminish my dark spots on my cheeks. Fine wrinkles have gone, my face feels soft."
I really like this daily moisturizer but unfortunately I will not be buying it again because I do not like the scent. If it was odor-free I would use it every day.
"I,ve been using the night cream for 3 yrs. My skin has never looked better. I suffered most of my life with acne scars but this has helped them tremendously and has smoothed out any wrinkles I had. I definitely would recommend this product."
I put this product on this morning and my skin felt really tight I went into the bathroom and looked in the mirror and my entire face is beet red like I have a major sunburn I washed my face but it still stings
"After using this twice a day for less than a week, I am amazed at the results! My deep wrinkles around my mouth are already less noticeable!! Smells and feels wonderful and I'm very sensitive to fragrances!! Love, love, love it!!!"
I tried this product and I loved the way it goes on and feels not to mention the effect it had. It lasted for over 2 months. It my be a little expensive but it was well worth it.
I love this deep wrinkle daily moisturizer by ROC its amazing how you can see the results in just two weeks. It made me feel and look younger just in time for the holidays...
I saw the commercial on tv for this and thought I'd try it. I have been using it for about 2 weeks now along with the ROC Instant Facial Smoother and my skin already looks smoother and firmer! I highly recommend the whole ROC line!!!
A little goes a long way. I love Roc daily moisturizer SPF30. I have been using this product for a few years. My face lights up with just a couple of dabs. It keeps my face radiant all day. Works on fine lines too. Definitely worth the try.
"I'm having the same reaction that ""Mrs."" posted. Burning and itching and swelling. It looks and feels like I have a very bad sunburn on my face and neck. I've never reacted to another lotion or sunscreen this way before."
I have used this product for about 1.5 weeks and my skin looks dryer and has a chapped/ruddy feeling to it...not sure if it is just turning over dead skin cells or if I should discontinue use?
use every day morning and bedtime [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Don't like the odor and face looks greasy. I'm in my early 60s. I had a bad reaction to the moisturizer. My face swelled up like a balloon, it's hot to the touch and itches. Something in the product caused this so if you buy it, know that what happened to me, could happen to you. I know there are positive reviews and mine is negative because I think not all people can handle what is in the product."
Love this product have no complaints yet just started using the creams last night. I have the night and day and also the eye creams.loved the way the night cream made my face feel smooth and soft.this morning I put on the day cream wow loved it and it also smells great smells clean and fresh.thanks Roc..
Bought this yesterday but had to take it off. This moisturizer has way too much perfume in it and the smell doesn't go away.
"Packaging is misleading. It does not contain retinol in the active ingredients, only sunscreen. Buyer beware."
it's been 1 week and I can see my lines going away slowly ::)) and I use it under my make-up ever day ... love it !!!!
This is a great product that works absolutely perfectly. And i look sooooo much younger even though im 67
"I LOVE all the Roc products. Over the last 5 years, occasionally have tried other products ( some very expensive), but always return to Roc."
"with good positive reviews and my personal experience, this product really showed its effectiveness in my face."
"I love Roc, this cream by far does more than anything I have ever used. I always get compliments on how good my skin looks."
I used..Night cream for over 15years.. in last 2years used ALSO SERUM AND DAILY MOISTURIZER..great results
Thank you. I just started 3 days now and I like it but some how near my eyes not good.. because Eye feels like itchy.
I always use Roc products but this is my favourite. My skin looks soft and hydrated. I love this product!!!
I need to know where I can find the 4 zone that you were selling as the 5 in 1 is not good but I loved the old one
Have used this for quite some time and am very pleased about the product. It keeps my wrinkles at bay. (I'm 87)
"I did not feel I got good results from this product. I have burning sensation on my skin and also I have the bare, dry skin, as if I had made a peeling. I've never been sensitive to facial creams."
"Good at first, seemed to help, but after three months, the product emulsified; and separated. Altho, ROC customer service refunded and stood behind their product"
I'm a 51 year old woman and was given advice years ago from a work friend to use ROC products. I will tell you that these products help make my skin smooth and helps with fine lines. My absolute favorite product is the skin smoother!
"After two days of using ROC Multi Correction Daily Moisturizer, I got a severe burning, itching rash on my face,neck, and chest. I have NEVER experienced this before with any other moisturizer. It took over three weeks to finally heal. The formula needs to be changed."
Do others have trouble with this causing yourr skin to feel like it is burning?
I have used it for a couple of months and it does reduce the wrinkles on your face
"Rapidly makes wrinkles disappear,"
Absolutely AMAZING!
The Product is very good.I would recommend this product.It is showing nice results.
my skin was very dry after using this product i can really see the difference
Why isn't retinol listed under ingredients for your products?
"my skin is not dry any more , it is so soft and smooth"
I use this product everyday in the morning. It has so many benefits in addition to having SPF!
Wrinkles gone neck and chin look smooth and fresh looking.
I have been using this for a week and it is wonderful I love it and can see results already...
"Did not help my deep wrinkles. Used for two weeks and my skin was not any better,"
Burns my skin- Not moisturizing at all [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use a lot of the ROC products and really like them. they work good for me.
I've been using this product for 2 1/2 years. I've seen a great improvement in uneven skin tone. Thanks.
"I loved that RoC Retinol Correcion Deep Dail Moisturizer had SPF in it. I liked how it made my sling feel and it gave me the coverage I needed when I went outside. I don't feel like I have a lot of wrinkles yet, but the ones I do have were defintely less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved the Roc Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer with SPf 30 free from Roc and Crowdtap for free to review. I absolutely love Roc Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer. I recommend it to everyone. In two weeks my wrinkles and crows feet went away. I look 10 years younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product, it has made my skin so much brighter and my smile lines aren't as deep as they where before I started this mission. I will continue to pruchase/use this Roc product because it has worked so well for my [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was highly skeptical about this product, but it WORKS! The deep wrinkles under my eyes and the crowsfeet are slowly disappearing. I used the product for 4 weeks straight and can completely tell the difference. I will continue to use this product for years to come. Easy to put on every morning, just add to your morning routine. It is that simple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So fair I am loving my experience with RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer, my skin seems clearer and less dull than normal. It's just been a few weeks but I am already seeing a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried other products in the past but nothing has worked like ROC. I have noticed an incrediable difference with my face and the fine lines. I am only nearing 30 and just needed something safe and effective in a few spots on my face. This is a total game changer. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great moisturizer! A Little pricey, but it left my skin looking dewy and soft! This was my first time using a retinol-based moisturizer, so I went easy with the amount I started with, and increased as the days went by. The moisturizer is light and rubs into the skin very easily. I was impressed with how my skin looked after the first application. And while the product is only sold in 1oz, a little goes a long way! I am excited to see how my skin will look after continued use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
RoC retinol correxion deep wrinkle moisturizer is a great product! I really like that it has a SPF30 right in it so you do not have to worry about sun exposure! I began to notice a big change in my skin with in about a week of using the product and i am sure i will keep using this ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30 left my skin looking better. It was a bit too strong for me to use everyday to start with, but I was able to work my way up to it. It was worth the transition because now my skin has fewer fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love my skin so much now and that's all thanks to RoC Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer! After using the moisturizer for a few weeks now, I find that my fine lines are less visible and my skin feel soft to touch. Thanks RoC! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free full-size sample of the RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30 from Crowdtap. I really like the product. It has a nice, subtle scent and applies easily to my skin. It gets absorbed quickly which I liked in particular, I have used it for about one week now and even though I don't have a lot of wrinkles, I can tell that the few I have are looking better (as in less noticeable). I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like RoC Retinol Correxion moisturizer! It's not a thick moisturizer and really seems go on my skin nice. I've already been noticing a difference in the little time I've been using it. It not only kept my face moisturized, but also seemed to firm my skin up more than what it was. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've never used this cream and the results are spectacular . Now I do not live without it. I am 35 years old and slowly I started to notice changes on my skin and since I'm using it I noticed a positive change and I again feel my skin healthy. Thanks #ROC and #Crowdtap for the opportunity to know about this product . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this retinol moisturizer for about 2 weeks now and am beginning to see a difference in my expression line already! I am looking forward to continue use and to hopefully see my wrinkle dissipate completely! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm really impressed by the moisturizer. As a first time user of not only RoC but of any retinol product, it has been a good experience. My face was left feeling soft, smooth, and light. There was no strong smell nor was there a heavy feeling that most moisturizers with SPF contain. It helped to minimize any beginning signs of wrinkles. I felt and looked younger. Next time I'm shopping, I'll be on the lookout for RoC and retinol products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
RoC RETINOL CORREXION Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30 has ROCked my world! It has showed me that not all moisturizers are the same. Results are fast and real. The wrinkles in my forehead have almost faded away. The crows feet have diminished. My skin feels smoother and my complexion is much more even. I am in awe of the effectiveness in this product! Thanks for showing me what a quality moisturizer can do! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"ROC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer is a great product. I've only used it two weeks but am already starting to see a decrease in my fine lines. It's goes on smoothly and doesn't take very much at all. A whole tube should last a long time! It's also not greasy! That's a big deal to me because I can't stand to have a greasy feel to my skin, especially my face! I can't wait to see the results after 12 weeks!

If you have the patience you will see obvious results in about two weeks! i sure did! RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30 was a dream come true. My husband even noticed the difference. It is light and you forget it is even on your face. Just apply and forget once a day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I liked how it had SPF and how it was not greasy. My wrinkles aren't too bad yet so I didn't really notice a difference after a couple weeks, but maybe that is the point, they didn't get any worse. I will keep using too see if my wrinkles are kept under control [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer with SPF 30 for about 3 weeks now. I have noticed a decrease in the lines on my forehead and a bit around my eyes. It has a greasy feel at first which I attribute to the sunscreen element, but it absorbs pretty quickly. Now if they could let me sample a product that will really help with the bags under my eyes, I will be 100% hooked on ROC. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was fortunate enough to get to try RoC deep wrinkle moisturizer for free and so far I'm super impressed I've only been using it for two weeks but already I feel my skin is looking fresher and more hydrated [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the cream because it is not greasy, it fades fast to implement, has a very pleasant odor and do not irritate the eyes. It's perfect because it protects you from the sun with sunscreen 30 and greatly helps dispel making eye wrinkles look younger. Definitely I recommend it 100%.

"Ive always roc'd the nightcream , but recently received a free sample to review. ROC RETINOL CORREXION formula is a time-released formula and therefore doesn't irritate my skin like other retinol products. I normally use sensitive skin products, but like the added benefit of spf30 in the RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® Deep Wrinkle Daily Moisturizer. Happy to be included with #WomenWhoRoc [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love my RoC Moisturizer with SPF 30. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and it has been doing wonders for my skin.

"I received this product to test and I love it. I am 28 but already see lots of signs of aging (maybe its the stress!) but my hair is gray and my face looks tired and already has wrinkles. After using this product for a short amount of time I noticed that my skin looks much better, brighter, and has less wrinkles! I would highly recommend this even if you do not have wrinkles as you will love how your skin looks!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Unfortunately, I didnt find out how sensitive I was to retinol until I used this product. I too broke out in a rash and it really scared me because I had no idea it was from the ROC cream. I want so bad to believe in ROC products, but most of their lotions and creams are made with Retinol. I guess I wont be a good testimony to anymore of your products until you can find a way to make the product not cause rashes."
"The first moisturizer I purchased was the ""4 Zone Daily Moisturizer SPF 30."" It was very rich & made my skin look hydrated. The product that replaced this one ""5 in 1 daily moisturizer"" is a diluted product & the pump doesn't work so I have to pour into my hand. I had just discovered this ROC product & was thrilled. Now I feel I've purchased an inferior product. I'm very disappointed I will have to find another moisturizer. Please bring back the original moisturizer. I love having a moisturizer with SPF 30!"
I am freaking out. My vision is blurred. Has been for the entire day. I applied this in the morning and avoided the eye area. I walked the dog and it must have seeped into my eye by perspiration. I have rinsed with water multiple times and now am considering going to ER. It has been over 8 hours of stinging eye and blurred vision.
I have been using the ROC retinol correxion deep wrinkle daily moisturizer for 3 weeks now and see great results! My crows feet have diminished significantly and the creases in my cheeks when I smile are not as dramatic. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
