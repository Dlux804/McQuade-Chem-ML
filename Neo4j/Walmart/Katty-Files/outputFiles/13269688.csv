I am 49 and always looking for products that really work to prevent and correct wrinkles. I use several ROC products and this one makes the most noticeable difference quickly and the price is great.
LOVE IT!!! It doesn't work miracles but you can see a difference if you're consistent. It softens the lines a bit.
"I usually do not waste my money on products like this. Wrinkle this or wrinkle that however, I was however I was given a tube .. Within the first day I could have sworn my face looked smoother but I did not believe. Then only 3 or 4 days later I swear my face wa"
"s way younger looking. Omg, this is what I am willing to pay more money for. It's priced right at the top of my budget and that's OK. I love all of the products from this kind. Would buy again. Will buy again"
After 2 weeks of daily use I m starting to notice the improvement and getting compliments from my coworkers about the change on my lines around the eyes and mouth.Cant be happier after hesitating on buying this filler for a lot less money than many others that did not work on my sun damaged and aged skin. I m 45 years old and tried many fillers before without results.
I have been using this product for years. I am totally impressed at what my Skin looks like. I stand behind your product 110 percent. Thank you! One happy 57 year old.
Great product. Saw results within a week!
"Thus far this product works exactly as advertised. In fact, I can tell the difference in my skin immediately upon usage. Think the worst wrinkles are giving up the ghost."
"Roc is a little confusing; how to use all the different products together. This is a boost for problem areas I think, so I put it on before the other Roc product day or night cream. Not sure what or why, but bought it so will use it."
"I'm 67 & should have known better than to believe something would work on my deep Marionette Lines from my nose to my chin. There really is not a product that can help this kind of deep wrinkle. I wish the product would have approached that area in the disclosure info. I used a whole tube around my mouth only (so that took a long time). Not 1 iota of a difference. Ladies with this horrid problem need not waste $ on this so called ""filler"". I was a sucker for the word & I even knew better. Shame on me."
"I've been using RoC for a while now and I've learned that the longer you use it the better it works, because of the Retinol that's in it. This little tube last for a long time, a little goes a long way. I've noticed a difference in the fine lines around"
"my eyes, they are beginning to fade and my skins appearance is more healthy looking. I recommend this product and really love the brand."
"I don't usually review products , but I can't tell you how impressed I am with this ! I have smoker lines around my lips and after putting this on the first time , they significantly erased them ! I'm sure after constant use , it will even be better . I'm very happy with this product ! thank you !!"
"I use Roc's Deep Wrinkle Filler as part of my daytime regimen. After finishing the product (a few weeks), I rotate it with Roc's Deep Wrinkle Serum so my skin doesn't get too used to the same product. The entire retinol correxion line delivers its promise of reducing lines and wrinkles. I will only use these products from now on. Amazing results."
i just recently bought this product it is a little pricy but well worth it for someone my age it does decrease the wrinkles apperance wether you use it alone or put makeup ovr it but it dos decrease the appearnce of them i like it and would defintely buy
it again
"I have been using this for a week. It does instantly do a good job of filling in my forehead and smile lines. I have noticed with twice daily use, the lines appear a little fainter as well. I'd like to see what it does after using a few more weeks. This"
is not greasy feeling. It's light and absorbs quickly. I will absolutely keep using this.
"I feel that the Roc Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Filler really did lessen the appearance of deep wrinkles.It is easy to use, leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and makes my face look younger because the wrinkles are not as prominent. I would definitely use it again and tell others to try it,it works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I feel compelled to review this amazing product. I've used it for a week and a half and can already see my deep smile lines softening and smoothing. It has NOT irritated my skin one bit. I will forever use this product to combat my worst obsession about my face. Nasiolabial folds are history.
RoC Retinol Correxion Eye Cream is for Anti-Aging and fights the signs of aging around your eyes. It has a nongreasy feeling and it is a moisturizing cream that is specially made to use around the eye area. It will reduce the look of dark circles under
your eyes and puffiness in four short weeks!
"I loved it. It fills in my creases and re-plumps my skin. My wrinkles are less noticeable, even my deep wrinkles. It also contains Hyaluronic acid to help hydrate my skin it feels softer and smoother I would definitely recommend this product to my friends [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
And switched to some Olay cream i had on hand. Too lazy to go to the store to replace it I noticed a difference in my skin. Been using it for almost two years....once per day in the morning over entire face. I know it has slowed the aging of my skin. 48 years old...highly recommend this product.
"Love how it smoothed out the fines on my forehead.....that area should visible difference instantly. Very little improvement on the slightly deeper wrinkles around mouth area. Would recommend for fine lines, but the deeper wrinkles might just take more"
time to improve.
I saw results from the RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Filler within a few days. The wrinkles around my eyes and mouth were diminished by a noticeable difference. I would use this product again and again. I loved the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product as it definitely reduces the appearance of my fine lines & deep wrinkles.
"Have used product before, found it very satisfactory. Liked Walmart,s price, significant savings over drug store prices."
I can tell the difference almost immediately. I have fine lines around my eyes. I use it twice a day! Love it.
"I am 63 and have used the most expensive brands!! This product is better! I am told I look in my 40s! Wish I could post my picture! Bottom line, you must find a product that works for you! All skin is different, but this is a must for me!!!"
i tried it and it did not rid them but I did notice it not as bad when smile I am only 30 so I like to still do skin care for the past 4 years so i can be less wrinkles from the sun and aging
"This is such an awesome product, it filled in some of my fine lines and I looked a lot healthier, which made me feel spectacular. It is a little pricey but well worth it!"
I am normally a dept store cosmetics consumer but I am sold on this! Worked rite away and looked great after I washed it off. First day using it but definitely will not be my last.
Nice thuck texture. Waste free container. With tube you can get it all oit. It did make me break out in areas i used it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Have used it once to twice per day as directed for two weeks now.....my hard creased wrinkles are fading...LOVE THIS. I do use it with Neutrogena Pore Refining exfoliating cleanser...they seem to be working well together!!! Think im HOOKED!!
"This cream really does what it says it will do, fills wrinkles. The wrinkles around my mouth, nose, and eyes diminish immediately when I apply this cream. I was skeptical, but it really does work and I always keep it on hand."
It made my skin feel tighter. I noticed an immediate difference. The wrinkles were no longer as noticeable. I will definitely continue to use Retinol Correxion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have only used a few times so not seen any results yet.
I work at a high end department store and have tested VERY expensive wrinkle fillers and I can tell you none works as well as Roc!!
as long as i'm using this product i feel my skin is not dry any more and it is really age prevention
I have deep wrinkles around my mouth and this product seems to lessen the appearance so I don't have to smile 'all' the time to avoid embarrassment.
MY WIFE USES THIS CRAM AND SHE SWEARS BY IT. I WOULD GIVE IT A HEARTY RECOMMENDATION. WORTH EVERY PENNY
I used this product for 6 wks. as told to do. I did not see any results at all; very disappointed. Could not recommend and will not buy again.
I have use this for four days and my lines are all most diminished this is a great product I will buy this again.
see results right away
"Fine Lines, Deep Wrinkles, skin sagging and uneven skin tone has starting to become a problem in my appearance and I am going to make sure that I attack this situation with ROC and I plan to be the most attractive as I was when I eadain my 20's. I'm going to use this product with the privelage of beginning a New Journey of Beauty."
"I usually buy my skin care at Sephora but I read online the benefits of using retinol and i wanted to try it without spending too much $. Since ordering this, I am actually on my second bottle I liked it so much. I use it every 2-3 nights. It is light weight but still moisturizing. I don't have a ton of wrinkles but I want to use it to prevent wrinkles."
"It's amazing how RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Filler has helped my face - it even glows! The wrinkles have ""eased"" up and my skin does appear to be tighter. It took about 2 weeks but I definitely saw a difference, my husband, friends and co-workers have as well!! Love, love, love this!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like my RoC Retinol Correxion deep wrinkle filler. It left my skin feeling soft and smooth. I didn't experience any red or rashy skin from using this cream. It absorbs fairly quickly which I like and didn't leave a greasy residue. I will continue to use it and plan on purchasing more when I am done with this tube. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The overall texture of the deep winkle filler cream was very rich and creamy. It wasn't overly heavy where you felt you needed to rub the cream off your face. It didn't make your face stiff. You need to apply the product in the morning as well as the evening, preferably before bed. Upon doing this, you will notice a difference in appearance with regards to the texture of your skin as well as watching your fine lines fade. It is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't sure what to expect when I first started using the product, but I was quickly surprised to see a difference in the fine lines on my face! It felt good when I applied it to my face. I was even happier when I began to notice improvement almost immediately! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Loved the feel of this product on my face It does not greasy or sticky. Does not look streaky or have a look that does not blend in well. Helps to fill in deep lines and wrinkles in just weeks of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the way it feels on my face. There was no burning and it dried quickly so that I could use my regular moisturizer over it. I could feel the difference almost instantly and it lasted through the entire day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using Roc Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Filler religiously. I apply a generous amount and I see results. It plumps my skin and improves the way it looks. I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking to improve the appearance of their skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am a fan of the brand. I use this product twice a day, in the morning and evening. I have noticed an improvement in my ""smile lines"". While it's not a miracle product, my lines are less noticeable. This is a great product for the price and certainly as effective as the department store brands that cost a fortune. I am sold on this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
my face feels so good when using this product! i Highly recommend it
Thumbs up the best!!!! I recommend this. Can't get any better for the price

"Loved this product!!! I saw minimal immediate results, after about a week i saw very noticeable results which allowed me the chance to spread the word to friends!!! I've mentioned before when I love something....I don't hold back and this is well worth"
the money and purchase.
"I love ROC RETINOL CORREXION DEEP WRINKLE because my skin looked all the time so dry and since I am using it my skin looks much better. I mean specially the wrinkles are not so deep now and my skin is always soft, shiny (not greasy shiny). I have been applying the cream 2 times at nights because you can be expose at the sun. Thank you so much for sending me this product I will buy when I finish my sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the product twice daily virtually since the day I received it. I have liked it with the exception of a couple times where when I applied it my skin turned immediately red. I'm not sure why that happened or what the situation was when this happened I will continue to use it and see if it happens again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I applied the ROC Deep Wrinkle Filler to my face, the creases on my face begin to fill out and my skin began to re-plump itself. My skin felt smooth and the product sis not break my skin out. I liked this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I will never be without this product again! I love the glow that it gives my skin!

This will be in gift bags for my sisters in their birthdays! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Roc Retinol is a great product. I immediately saw a difference with my small fine lines, I loved how it felt going on and the fragrance was soft. The only reason I didn't give it a grade A all the way across was I still haven't been using it long enough to see the deeper wrinkles go away completely. Although they look to be on their way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed using the product and it seems to have helped the wrinkles on my forehead and some of the wrinkles by my eyes. I did not experience any burning from the product, which was a plus. I think using it with RoC face lotion would be a big benefit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use ROC retinol for years - it's wonderful. I really didn't think the wrinkle filler would make any difference. I was surprise with the results . The furrow between my eyes are less noticeable as is the crows feet . I am definitely adding it to my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I LOVE it! I have been using this for a few weeks and the results are great! The deep lines on my forehead are so much better and the small lines around my eyes are almost gone! My skin looks amazing since starting this lotion and I love the subtle scent
and easy application. I will definitely continue using this!
"Very good product. Promises confirmed! I have been using this for about three weeks now and have a very noticeable difference in the look and feel of the skin on my face and neck. Some wrinkles - GONE, some - much less noticeable. Provided the price is not outlandish I will continue to purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It seems to be helping with a deep wrinkle by my mouth. I'm going to continue using it to see how much it helps.
One of the reasons why I don't know if I like it is because you have to be careful about the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The filler seemed to help with very fine lines, but I noticed on the larger or deeper lines, did not plump up. I am thinking maybe I have to use the product longer than a few weeks. I did like it though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® Deep Wrinkle Filler did a great job filling in the deep wrinkle around my mouth. These wrinkles have always bother me. Now with RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® Deep Wrinkle Filler all it takes is a tap a day around the area and wow you can see the differences. I will continue to use this product day and night knowing that when I wakeup the deep wrinkles will almost be gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a really nice moisturizer that goes on easily and absorbs quickly into the skin. RoC Retinol Correxion isn't harsh to my skin and it has a very light, nice scent. If you're looking for an affordable skin moisturizer with retinol, then this one is for you. A little bit goes a long way and the cost is nothing compared to what you pay at department stores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really was happy to try RoC wrinkle filler, The scent was not over powering, and went on easily. It soaked in rather quickly, and was able to continue with my regular facial routine. It did not add a lot of extra time. I did find that it worked better on nose to mouth lines and mouth lines, than around eyes. I will buy this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
In have been using the product for about 3 weeks now. Haven't really noticed a difference in my skin texture. I have other lotions for my face that I like better than this lotion. Maybe if you had major wrinkles you could see a result after a while but i think it would take a long while. Texture of the lotion is good and it absorbs quickly. Do not get it too close to the eyes though as it will burn a bit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had previously used Roc Deep wrinkle night cream and liked the results. But the Roc Deep wrinkle filler gave me immediate, noticeable results! I used it twice a day, following the directions on the product label. It absorbed quickly and was very pleasant to use. I felt like this product targeted my deep wrinkles and lines. This product will be a permanent part of my skin care routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Rock Retinol Correction Deep Wrinkle Filler for about 2 weeks. I can see a difference already. My wrinkles are getting less noticeable. Especially around my eyes. It has a nice light scent. Goes on creamy. Not greasy. I will definitely be using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using RoC RETINOL CORREXION Deep Wrinkle Filler for almost 2 weeks now. I really like the hydration and a little seems to go a long way so the value is good. I am not seeing any drastic changes to my crow's feet yet but I really like the hydration which smooths the skin under my eyes. I am hopeful that I will begin to see a reduction in the wrinkles around my eyes in the next few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was hoping this would be a miracle cream. It isn't, BUT it did help. My wrinkles between my eyebrows are lesser and I have noticed a brightening under my eyes. Whether it is less wrinkles or just brighter skin, I don't care! Better is better and I'll take it! This did not break out my skin or cause redness or peeling or any other side effect. I am glad I was chosen for this and will try other products from their line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I first tried RoC RETINOL CORREXION Deep Wrinkle Filler at night because I have to say I was skeptical of the outcome. All I accomplished by doing that was wasting it. The following day I applied it before my cosmetics and was amazed at how my skin looked and felt. My makeup went on smoother and I have to say, I think I looked younger. Ladies, this is a must try [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream goes on smooth, it is not sticky or greasy. It is very moisturizing, I have only been using for less than a week, I did notice a slight temporary improvement on crows feet, but I am optimistic and will continue using it. I love ROC products and will write another review after I use it a little longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have already started noticing the fine lines (crows feet) around my eyes dimishing and the deeper wrinkles on my forehead and around my mouth. I look forward to finishing this entire sample to see where my wrinkles are at that time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I like to use this product religiously every night. I tried the original RoC Retinol Correxion Night Cream as well as the sensitive both are wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the RoC retinol deep wrinkle filler for 2 weeks now and I am definitely noticing an improvement in my skin. The wrinkles aren't as deep and I have fewer overall wrinkles. The overall tone on my skin is better too. I really like the way this product has performed for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the ease of use of the Roc Retinol Correxion Deep wrinkle Filler. It does not have any irritants or bad scents. It makes the wrinkles less visible. I've only used it a few days and can't wait to see the results over a longer period of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product both in the a.m. and p.m. for approximately one week. Perhaps it takes much longer to see even minimal results, but so far I do not see any difference at all. I will continue to use the product and if things change will update my review, but at this point, I wouldn't spend the money and would use Clarin Blur instead. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using the RoC Retinol correxion Deep Wrinkle Filler for 5 + days, I have notice already a change in the wrinkles around my eyes. They seem less defined . The cream is soft on the skin, moistureizes and helps correct my lines around my eyes and face. I like the way it feels on my skin. It really seems to do what it says it will do, which is a definite plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A dream come true, it really seems to be working. I have use ROC products and loved them but guess I forgot about it. So glad I got to try it and remember how great it worked before and seems to be doing the same thing now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using for less than a week I have noticed my deep wrinkles on my forehead, crows feet become less noticeable. My small one around eye area are hard to even see! I has no irritation what so ever. I can't even imagine what my face will look like after using it for a month. If I were to compare a picture of myself from 10 years ago I would look the same. Take no time or special effort to use. There is no itching, burning, tingling or irration I have had with other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only used this for a few days and only at night but I noticed that when I showered in the morning, my skin felt very soft. I did not notice any less wrinkles or that my wrinkles were less visable but, like I said, I only used it for a few days. I hope that my wrinkles get better after a longer use period. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My experience so far with Roc Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkly Filler has been phenomenal. I had a few deep creases at the corner of my eyes that bothered me because they were really visible when I smiled or laughed. After using the product I have seen visible results that are above my expectations. The product was easy to apply, non irritating, and a pleasant fragrance. I will continue to use this product and most definitely will purchase for continued use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Perhaps after a lengthier application time. I only received this product a week ago or less. I didn't like it that much after only trying it for 2 times. The package says to wait until 4 weeks have passed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product . It was very easy to apply and the results were fabulous . I would put it on in the morning and it would stay all day. I did not have to re-apply. I got several compliments on my apperance. people said ""what did you do ,You look great"". My close friends I told my secret to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i love the large tube...seems like it will last a long time. it goes on very easily...seems to melt right into my skin. no odd odor to it. i really feel like it does plump my skin up and helps my wrinkles instantly! i can't wait to see how my skin looks by the time the tube is gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A very nice creamy lotion that goes on nicely and absorbs fairly quickly. When used at night I noticed a definite improvement in my forehead wrinkles and the deep crevice between my eyes when I woke up. They were plumped and smoother looking. I had a slight irritation around my mouth and will use less in that area going forward. Overall I like this product and plan to continue to use it. I'm looking forward to the more long term results.

"My experience so far with ROC Retinol Correcxion Deep Wrinkle Filler has been positive. It is rich, creamy, absorbs quickly and does not leave a greasy residue. The very nature of this product mentions the expectations of seeing results in about a month. At this point, I have not used this product long enough to see visible results, but I feel I will in another 2 weeks or so. I have a very high opinion of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This made the lines in my face look smaller, less noticeable. It definitely plumped up my facial skin. I was able to apply my makeup over it in the am without a problem, and used it at night before bedtime. I look and feel younger when I use this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only received the product 3 days ago, but have used it twice daily since then, so 6 applications. It says on the instructions that it may tingle -- it does not tingle when I apply. It smooths like any moisturizer would, but nothing dramatic. Perhaps I have not been able to use it long enough, but I keep getting reminders and want to be sure I respond in a timely manner. All in all my opinion right now is that it has not made any difference in filling wrinkles, deep or otherwise. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product came out of the tube nicely with just enough product being dispensed. It soaked into the skin completely. I did not find that it filled in my deep wrinkles but took care of the smaller ones [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have sensitive skin so I was expecting this product to irritate my skin. Well I was pleasantly surprised. No burning or tingling. Worked beautifully. I noticed a difference in my skin within 24 hours. I love this product I will buy it and I'm probably going to be using many more ROC products. Thank you for choosing me to test this product.

I received a free RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle filler from Home Tester Club and I am so happy with the results of using it. I could see an immediate difference in my skin. It has only gotten better the more days that I have used it. Definitely targets fine lines and wrinkles. I have already purchased another tube of it. Easy to find to purchase and reasonably priced.

"Although I do not have a LOT of deep wrinkles, I did have crepey skin and creases above my mouth. I no longer have those creases, thanks to RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® Deep Wrinkle Filler.. The frown lines between my eyebrows are noticeable lessened, too. My complexion overall is smoother, tighter and younger-looking after just four days of use. I definitely will recommend RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® Deep Wrinkle Filler.to family and friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Wow I love Roc Retinol Correcxion deep wrinkle filler it filled the deep and the not so deep I am noticing visible difference in my face and I love it . Its so easy to use feels lightweight and does and amazing job on my fine lines and wrinkles. Friend keep asking me if I had a procedure done or found the fountain of youth because I am looking younger [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At first I was skeptical because my facial skin is dry, wrinkly and breaks out at the same time. I am 48 years old and it seems worse than it ever was during puberty!! ROC Retinal Correxion Deep Wrinkle Filler helps moisturize my skin without being greasy, does NOT cause my face to break out and gently plumps out fine lines and helps to cover up wrinkles. I will be purchasing this product and have already recommended to a dear colleague. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This RoC moisturizer is a little thicker cream, which is great because it doesn't run, soaks in well and fairly quickly so you can apply makeup right after. I've used this RoC Retinol Correxion Deep Wrinkle Filler for about a week and I've already noticed a change, I'm excited to see how much my wrinkles will disappear using this eye cream. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to see an improvement in their eye area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® Deep Wrinkle Filler is wonderful!! I was pleasantly surprised to see results the first day!! My eyes especially immediately looked and felt better. After applying moisturizer and makeup, my wrinkles and fine lines looked smoother and diminished some! I cannot wait to use this product daily and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to feel better about the aging process. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product worked very well. The scent is not too strong, and it was quite gentle on my extremely sensitive skin. It didn't take very long to start seeing improvement in my skin, but using it on a regular basis is a must to maintain the results this product gives. Overall, I would recommend this product.

"Since I just started to use this product, just received today. I am anxious to see all the positive changes that will be taking place with my deep wrinkles. Very easy to apply no irriatation with the application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is VERY greasy and shiny did not like it at all! It broke out my skin. Stung my eyes when the perspiration hit it... It might be ok up north but NOT in the deep south in the summer when you need it most The auction was fun... Customer service was great!
"Does NOT smooth out wrinkles, no better than face lotion"

Fills the pores and smooth my face and makeup after using it my skin feels and looks subtle [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Disappointing—this moisturizer never sinks into my skin—it just leaves a greasy coating on my face. I stopped using it after a few days. Total waste of money.
"Awesome, saw a deference in just a couple of days. It helped fill the many wrinkles from being in the elements all the time. I would definitely recommend this product to others............. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It seemed to work some of the wrinkles so not so noticable but they are still visible. Seem to absorb quickly and no residue or gready feeling left behind. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have used this product for 3 weeks and have noticed no difference in my areas. I have a deep wrinkle above each eye that looks like someone stuck their nail in my skin and left the impression. I applied this product twice a day and have not noticed a difference. I wish someone who make a product that would help in my situation.
"This product just ""sat"" on top of my skin all night. Very heavy. When I first put my face in the water in my morning shower I could just feel it all ""slide"" off of my face. Really gross and would never use it or recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Roc Retinol product for over two weeks. I immediately noticed that the skin around my eyes and lips was softer. After 1 week , the lines at the corners of my eyes were less noticeable and after 2 weeks the tiny lines around my mouth seemed smaller. I will continue to use this product as I am happy with the results . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
