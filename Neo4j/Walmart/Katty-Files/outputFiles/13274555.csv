"I'm a working mom of 2 and these are fast and high quality face cleaners. I feel mildly exfoliated afterwards. They are very thick and generate lots of suds, so I cut them in half and they last twice as long."
I have been using this product for a few years and love it. However I have been paying a lot more for the product at a local drugstore. I am so happy Walmarts price is more affordable ! I will be purchasing again in the future.
"Brought this one week ago . Sun damaged , 56 yr old skin . Love this product, I use many actives and I find everything seems to work better . I love my smoother baby soft skin . My forehead is amazing, I still have wrinkles but they are softer and less noticeable. Dying to see what this does after a month . Love , it's a win win product."
I really like this product!
36 Terrible dry flaky skin and oily. I have used this 1 week and my skin is as smooth as silk. Flakiness gone and my skin is glowing. I love the textured side. I use this twice a day. I feel balanced and youthful looking
"I had an allergic reaction from retinal (different line) leaving the skin around, and on my eyelids dry, flaky, and swollen. I decided to try these, and while I still have some flakiness, my skin looks much better. They clean your skin so well, I have a youth glow right after using it. I am determined to use the entire container daily until it's empty (usually don't use anything consistently)"
I love these cleansing disks. I've been using using them for months and my skin is brighter and smoother. The only problem I have is that there is no good way to travel with them... and I travel 85% of time for work. The container is too bulky to pack in my toiletry case and when I took some in a plastic ziplock bag the moisture from the pads created suds and then leaked through two ziplock bags all over my other stuff. Is there a travel pack of these available or a compact travel case?
"I have been using this product in the evening for the last month. So many people have been complimenting me on my skin and how youthful and even my skin looks. (I'm 74) They say it must be genes. The response is, Really!, when I tell them it's ROC [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"These do a great job of cleaning my skin, and smell lovely!"
"I used this on my face to see if it would remove or lighten some dark spots. It removed them completely. It's not harsh, and can be used everyday, and your face feels really clean and smooth."
I love this product. I have been using the cleansing disks for 6 years and am very satisfied with the product. They are easy to use and rinse off clean. They leave my face feeling smooth and soft as a baby's behind.
"I LOVE these disks. They make my skin so soft and they smell amazing. After a short amount of time, my pores on my nose and on either side of my nose are noticeably smaller and I use a magnifying mirror for makeup so it's really obvious. I HIGHLY recommend these to anyone. You WILL notice a change in your skin."
"May I first tell you that the results of this product combined with the serum are just amazing! I am a 5o year old former model and after using the combination for two months, I have seen the lines under my eyes and my skin tone restored to what it was at 25-30. May I also say that the discs and the serum (combined) also reduced my pore size and faded the few freckles across my nose and around my eyes. Thank you so much-amazing!"
I've added these pads to my daily beauty routine 4 weeks ago. I use them to remove my make-up and as a cleanser. They are so worth the cost! The pads have plenty of product to cover my face neck and even arms. They exfoliante so well without hardness and I can use my acne cleanser as well. My skin looks tighter lifted. My pores are smaller lines are diminishing. I'm so happy with this I can't recommend it enough. I'm just sorry I haven't used this longer. So worth the money.
"At the end of the day I look forward to cleansing my face with this wonderful product. I never go to bed without using it, followed by the ROC Nightly Multi Correction cream. I am in my eighty's & continue to care for my skin with the best, that being ROC products."
"I am 26 and have sun damage on my nose, along with fine lines around my eyes, forehead and mouth. I started looking at resurfacing products since I saw these at the store, and decided to try RoC first. These have me HOOKED! I use these in the morning and at night, and pair it with RoC retinol serum, and the fine lines have vanished, and my nose looks 100x better! I have been using both for almost two years and could not ask for a better product!"
I am 56 years old with red hair and fair skin.Thankfully always used spf15 so few wrinkles but lines starting around my lips and eyes. Also have stubborn blackheads and large pores on my cheeks. This product is clearing blackheads after 2 uses. Get this product!
"I use the Disks at night and the Resurfacing skin cleanser in the morning. This routine has caused my skin to feel 200% smoother, the sun damage to my face is greatly improving but what I've also noticed is all my blackheads are gone after doing this routine for just over a month."
"After the first use, my skin felt very clean and smooth. After about 5 days, dead skin cells were gone. Blackheads improved and reduced. Small lines reduced. After one month, small lines barely visible, deeper wrinkles on forehead still there, but skin had a smoother texture not seen in years. I am continuing to use this product to smooth out large pores on sides of nose and chin. A ""must have"" product to use every day. I use before bed."
"These resurfacing disks have 2 sides. A smooth side to wash with, and a more textured side that is much more abrasive and helps exfoliate the skin. As to their 'resurfacing' value, I don't know. But my face certainly feels clean after I use them. I've tried pads that seem to do nothing, and tried cleansers with 'scrubbers' added into them. These are the best by far. Be prepared for some small acne at first, as these are going to bring any impurities to the surface within the first week of use."
This is my first ROC product and I love it. I do not have sensitive skin. My pores were enlarged on my nose and cheeks and using this for less than a week changed that significantly. I used these pads with the ROC night cream and in less than a week my pores appeared smaller as well as some dark spots were lightened. I would definitely recommend.
"I like this product very much. I have very sensitive skin and have difficulty with most cleansers, especially those with exfoliation properties, being too harsh. But this feels cool to the skin- Doesn't burn or irritate- and leaves your face feeling smooth and clean. I have been using it nightly for a week now without any burning or irritation- Which is a record for me! I recommend this for those women with more sensitive skin especially. It feels great!"
"So I just turned 37! I've been using Roc products for a couple of months now, and the improvement has been huge! I used Olay before, but my skin is sensitive and it caused some breakouts and redness. Zits and wrinkles, lovely. I started out with the serum, because it's so light, and after about 2 weeks all my forehead and eye wrinkles were just gone! Then I added these discs and now I glow! My skin feels so soft and smooth. Everyone's noticing too! Doesn't get any better (without a plastic surgeon lol)."
"I have been using this product for approximately 2 years. I must admit that I do not even use these disc every day. ( imagine if I used every day as recommended) However, when I want a quick pick up for my skin. I use it. I always get compliments. Without fail someone says to me you look good, what did you do? I tell them about my Roc disc. They are a must for my beautiful glowing skin."
I love the way this has helped my skin. My face is smoother and looks much healthier than it ever has.
"The dirt that comes of my face in the evening is shocking, you wouldn't think after a day of being outside walking around or just having fun, that your face would collect so much dirt. The daily resurfacing disks are amazing, they clean my face so much better than anything I have ever used. Yes I recommend you try it for your selves."
I have VERY dry sensitive skin. I recently tried the ROC line for moisturizing and tackling fine lines. I am in love with everything I purchased. I cannot say enough about these cleansing discs. They cleanse and prep my skin perfectly for my ROC nighttime cream. Because of these discs I have much softer brighter skin. The price for this line is so unbelievably reasonable. Totally in love with this line and I have tried them all. Thousands down the drain!
I was looking for a exfoliator when I came across the reviews for this item online.. So I figured for the price I could give it a try and not be out much & I instantly fell in love when I first tried it !! For such a little pad the phone up nicely. One side is rough for exfoliating the other side is smooth for around the area. I use this morning and night to cleanse my face. I must add that I cut them in half which is more than enough pad to clean my entire face.
"Being 27, I started using anti aging products since I was 25..as I believe to prevent it not cure it. I heard Roc products were pretty good and I must say this cleaning disc is by far my favorite. My skin is smooth,and soft and it's perfect for the T zone."
"This product is so good makes my skin feel so soft and smooth gets all the dirt and bad oils off my face I use the face wash first and then the disks anyone who wants a clear, smooth, soft face buy these products. For the price these products are they do the good"
A neighbor passed this on to me. I am 60+ and have a few lines. I used this on Friday and Saturday . On Sunday my face was very red and my eyelids totally swollen. I did not use it on my eyelids. Small bumps on forehead. Iced my eyes all day today. I also took antihistamines and pain pills.Tomorrow will ask doc to prescribe Prednisone if I am not better. I don't know what is making me allergic to this product. I use other Roc small tube products with no adverse effects and I will buy them again.
"I love this thing, saved my skin. I am a 24 y/o woman, that always had a perfect skin (I am from Chile) since I came to America my sin turned awful, and nothing could fix it, until recently I found this! I am totally in love with, it is awesome, abarsive enough to take the inpurities, lack heads, etc of you skin, with not do any damage. Also is not expensive at all. it totally worth it. you will love it. And a Plus for me was that my expression lines are not not noticeable as before, not as much, they still there, but now it is hard to tell."
"Face feels smooth immediately after. The disks are big enough, and saturated enough, to cut in half, but I cut them into quarters. Yes might seem small in size but there is allot of cleanser in that small piece. Plus it makes them last allot longer ! I also use Roc deep wrinkle serum, and Roc Correxion Max Resurfacing Anti-aging system as part of my nightly routine. Be patient takes about 8-10 weeks but you WILL see a difference."
"I tried the disc for a week now and my skin looks softer. It foams nicely and rinses off well. I do like the rougher side. It doesn't feel like I'm taking off skin, but just enough to clear the pores more than just washing. I will continue wise these and see the end results in 12 weeks. I wish the container was smaller or discs in a foil pack, to make it easier to travel with"
awesome product. affordable skin care
RoC® Daily Resurfacing facial Cleanser Scrub-- Please bring it Back. Disks are not great!
I like the older version Resurfacing facial Cleanser Cream/Scrub and was great. Why was this discontinued ? It is a great product. Please bring it back!
"Wow these work so well! I like to use the makeup facial wipes to remove my makeup because they are so easy but I never felt like it was removing it all. Not with these, they are thicker than any pads or wipes, soapy"
I have a very textured forhead and after only a couple of uses tmy forhead is smooth. Leaves your skin baby soft. I wish I would have known about these ages ago. A must have.
I started using this product to help minimize lines. I have found that my skin is more dry with more lines. Although it does clean the face it does leave it extremely dry. Not a product I would endorse for minimizing wrinkles.
53 years old and still looking pretty good but WOW! Fine lines? Gone! Splotchy skin? Gone! Used on the decollete area....vast improvement! My husband immediately noticed how clear and even my skin was. OK! SOLD!
i use this disk at night time and applying my night moisturizing emulsion . Seems my skin can absorb all my skin care products and i woke up with smooth and fresh skin every morning. love this disks so much .:)
"I really liked how the product feels and the results, however, if you really really have dry skin, then your going to need a heavy moisture (well at least for me)."
"I use this product 2-3 times per week. It makes my skin feel smooth and look great! I use it on my neck, chest area, and arms too for extra exfoliating."
"I really love these disks. I've been using them for only one week, but can already see and feel a difference in the appearance of my skin. I cannot believe how incredibly soft they make my skin feel. Thank You Roc....I'm in Love !!!"
I have never had a bad reaction to a facial product but this one felt kinda harsh on my skin. After 3 days i got a patch of red that stings and has not gone away in 2 weeks after stopping use.
started using this for about 2 months at first it seemed ok but i started to break out and had a few rashes on my face
i will be switching back to my old routine.
Very good product. I don't anything else to clean my face. Excellent price from Walmart!!
amazing product. saw results in days.
I really like these. One day when I wasn't wearing make-up someone tell me my skin was glowing and what did I have on it.
I have a background in skincare. I absolutely recommend this product. it has the biggest bang for the buck in the world of resurfacing products.
"After 2 weeks my skin is brighter, softer, much less redness, and the large pores around my nose are now almost invisible."
I've tried lots of face products and these resurfacing disks are hands down my new favorite! Highly recommended!
Love theses disks!! I cut them in half as they are huge so they are worth the cost! Daily exfoliation is perfect for my skin.
I've used this product for years and just love it! It's scrubbing side gets the fine dirt off and the smooth side gently soothes your face. When paired with the daily moisturizer it's heaven.
best for your face
"Tried this product because my usual product became hard to find. Within 2 days my skin was beyond dry. After 2 weeks my skin looked like it was made out of shoe leather! Perhaps appropriate for acne prone skin where you want some relief from oil, but if you're looking to hydrate, this is NOT the product for you."
My face always feels so clean after using these disks. I love that one side is textured for exfoliating and the other is smooth for cleaning. Been using it for years along with the Roc night cream and I have been able to keep deep wrinkles at bay : )
"Simply put, I love it. One use, and I could tell a HUGE difference in the texture of my skin."
I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! MY SKIN FEELS SOFT AND MY SKIN IS BRIGHT!! I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT!!
"This product did a great job in making my skin look smooth again. Thank you, RoC!"
I stopped using this product after 5 days of using it. It dries up my skin.
This product removes all dirt/make-up/oil. Leaves my skin clear and radiant.
I really like this product!!!!! It makes my face feel refreshed :-) without drying my skin.
this is really good skin care productsyou really need to try it Thank You Skeetrr
"Easy to use, love the smell, face feel great after I use."
I love this product. It cleanses my skin without drying it out and keeps my skin perfectly exfoliated.
I've been using this for years and it works very well. Easiest to use in the shower - gently scrub your face with a disc and wash it off. Then immediately put on serum or moisturizer or both.
"This is my first time using this,About two times a week is all you need to use this ,if your skin is very sensitive only use 1 a week, Great to use in the shower."
"I love this ROC brand and I was so excited to give the pads a try-especially since I had a zit on the tip of my nose. I opened the jar, took a whiff and the pads smelled similar Formula409. I tried to ignore the aroma so that I could try it out. Sadly, I cannot use it. I was looking forward to using it. After reading all the positive reviews, perhaps I got a bad batch. Who knows??"
"Excellent exfoliator, better I had used in mang times. Super ultra recomend!"
"I love the exfoliating pads, I only had it a couple of days and I feel the difference"
This product is amazing. Please do not stop making this product.
"I've only just started using these cleansing pads, and so far I see no difference in my skin. Also, I thought they were toner/astringent pads, not cleansing."
"Just started using it, but, so far I like it. Perfect way to remove makeup and cleanse."
It does exactly what it claims to do. My skin looks and feels great.
"This broke my face out, made it itch and burn, but I do have sensitive skin ;("
Stopped using and my face showed it. These work
"worked well, good exfoliation"
Kinda burned my skin but felt super soft afterwards.
