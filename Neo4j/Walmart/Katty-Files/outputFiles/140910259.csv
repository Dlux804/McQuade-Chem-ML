I have been using Image skincare for a few years now. I see a huge difference in the texture of my skin. I highly recommend this product especially for aging skin.
Have used this product in the past with great results.
Absorbs quickly and soften fine lines
"Slight stinging sensation - not unpleasant, just feels like it's working"
Love this product. Have used it for years and this was an excellent price.
Found this so much cheaper here. I love Image product. It arrived quickly and works great!
I will update after I've used this product for a while...
I do not like this cream at all. It actually makes my skin sting when I apply it. I would not recommend it at all. Very disappointed. I will be going back to my L'Oreal face cream.
Fake! So disappointed it's a yellowy colour with a bad smell
