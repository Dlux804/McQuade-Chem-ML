I will always buy this olay whip.
"The cream works very well on my dry skin! I put it on at night and helps make my skin smother and not scalely ! I apply it ,also, for the day! It works wonders! and it helps my rosacea a lot i gave 5 stars because it is the best moisture that doesnt irritate my skin after i tried lancome bobbi brown dior estee lauder clarins nothing slolved my irritation skin until i bought the luminous whip cream it is really a magic so far one week use"
"Better late than never I guess but I recently decided to see what the fuss is about. This moisturizer is amazing. This is half the price of my moisturizer and twice as good. My skin is soft, matte, my skin stays hydrated all day. I love the feel of the cream turning almost liquid on my skin. It's a great base for primer too. My skin looks better even only after using short time. I recommend anyone try this."
Lightweight moisturizer that works well as a makeup primer! I mix this with my makeup and my skin looks amazing all day! (I put this and my makeup on just before 8am and it's looking good 10 hours later!) Definitely recommend for anyone with teens-20's skin who is looking for a good daily moisturizer with some extra pep since it has really great ingredients such as niacinamide and green tea!
Love this Olay product. After one weeks use texture of me face has Improved. It is a very light moisturer and makes your skin feel soft with no weight.
"I have always hesitated to use facial moisturizers because they are often heavy and greasy in addition to not absorbing into my skin.I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it was light and instantly absorbed into my skin.In the morning it allowed me to apply my make-up immediately after applying it because of the rapid absorption.My my make-up stayed looking fresh all day.Additionally, I used it at night at it did a great job keeping my face moisturized during the night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is great. It has a very light fragrance when you put it on. It makes my skin look and feel brighter. The pores beside my nose look a bit better. It absorbs well and doesn't look or feel greasy. Before applying makeup put it on and give it a few minutes to absorb. I didn't do that the first time I tried it and my foundation didn't go on smoothly. Now I do that and my makeup looks great. I received this product to try and plan to purchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My my skin super soft and glowing. Very refreshing. But I don't feel it does much for fine lines though.
I am currently using Olay Whip with 25 SPF and I love it! I am thinking of switching to Olay Luminous Whip...I am wondering if the cream itself has a luminous sheen in the jar? This would be great!
To Heavy/oily not what was advertised. whips indicate lite cream but this heavy cream makes my face sweat before I can leave my bathroom or finish my make up in a fully air condition room. I will not purchase again.
I love this moisturizer! It isn't greasy. It is a little like a gel and when you rub it in it absorbs into your skin very well and feels light. My skin feels soft and healthy. Great scent too.
Pretty light. Not sticky oily at all. But good for normal to dry skin too. Smells good. Not too strong smell. Best deal for $15ish! Found it better than a few Sephora lotion samples I tried.
"Surprisingly amazing, soft, non-greasy texture an incredible value."
"I was so excited when I saw a moisterizer claiming to be luminous, as i'm a sucker for dewy fresh looking skin. But I definitely did not get that from this product. I'm not sure if it's my skin type or a bad batch, but it just doesn't work for me. When I'm rubbing it in, the cream starts to ball up and starts flaking. Not to mention it makes my skin feel very VERY dry, as if I have put 20 layers of powder on. It's horrible. I unfortunately had to stop using it and won't be purchasing it again."
"Instead of absorbing, it turned gummy on my face, Even when applied very lightly. Yes, it had a matte finish, but instead of luminosity, it made my face look like it needed a good cleansing. The smell is overpowering and not in a good way. And the impossible to remove plastic lid.....who came up with that idea?! This was a total waste of my money."
"Application is smooth, but balls up on the skin when it dries, instead of absorbing."
I love Olay Luminous Whip face moisturizer (without the SPF). It has such a smooth
"I've been using this brand since i was like 18yrs old. Today i'm 40 and and will still be asked to show my id for me to buy a drink or enter the club....lol..... I started using Whip Regenerist about 2wks ago, with a collaboration of the way it smells and feels, i can't help but look at myself like i'm still 21...Thank You Olay...from me and my 70yr old mom that can pass for 50!!!!"
"Claims of evening your tone and reducing pores didn't really work for me and I thought well at least it is matte and has 25 spf, but the ""matte""-ness also fell short. Forehead still a bit shiny (not sheen unfortunately), although better than their regular face cream in terms of its less sticky feel just don't expect matte. I've had better products for a matte finish. It smells good though and fun to apply. Overall, it claimed to do many things but spread itself too thin."
"After trying many products on the market from very expensive Cle de Peau to regimes of multiple moisturizers, for the am and for pm and in the sun, Olay Luminous whip excels, from my first use the appearance of my skin looked healthier, radiant and felt so luxurious, i love the matte finish and it's the only moisturizer I need to use, thank you Olay, my quest for finding the perfect moisturizer is over!"
"I have been using this product for the past month in hopes that it will help minimize my enlarged pores and the texture of my skin. It did not. Although it did not help with that situation, the product did feel light on my face and had a nice smell. It kept my face hydrated (I live in Hawaii, where it's SUPER HUMID). This product was alright. I will not be repurchasing as it was a little pricey, too."
"Got a sample which I used at night, it was creamy,light, with a luxurious feel,skin looked and felt supple,was bouncy,hydrated,soothed and great on my combo/dry sensitive skin.Can be used as primer making it a 3-1 product since you can use this day and night plus quality ingredients with VB-5s,greentea extracts etc. makes this a GREAT buy!Cant judge it on my pores/skintone since I didnt have enough product/time.So glad I got to review this, I will be purchasing this, thank you P&G and Olay!"
I tried the sample I received in the mail and was kind of nervous. I broke out from this moisturizer and I have always had clear skin. I have used olay moisturizers in the past and never had any issues with them. I am disappointed with this product and I wanted to try it because of the great reviews.
I was hesitant about buying this due to the high price in drug stores... but finally caved in. First off the way it's product looks is worth the money. It's a good amount of moisturizer and has a cap to seal as well. It's a moisturizer and primer in one.. as soon as you put this on it goes right into your skin and dries instantly. It has such a good scent to it but doesn't irritate skin at all.
"I got a sample in a magazine and thought it was great bought the full size and it was not scented like the sample. You have to use a lot of this product because it dries so fast and you can't get your makeup on without feeling like you have Elmer's glue on your face. My pores aren't any smaller and my non tzone areas are now more dry now, with no decrease in oil in my t zone."
"I've been using this product for a few days. My main goal was to reduce the pores on my face. I'm sure it will take a while to get there but in the meantime I am enjoying how it feels. My face feels great after application. I have a very oily complexion and the product actually adds to it but I don't mind. I guess if too much oil is a factor, ladies would probably differentiate from my opinion. My face looks alive. I love the product!"
I bought luminous Play whip after getting advice from a skin advisor to use luminous product line. My skin feels good immediately after application but the moisture does not last longer than 3 hours. The whip starts to peel off after a few hours. This product smells amazing but can not serve my purpose well.
"olays science, formulations,surpasses other brands.This new cream is stellar. ingredients are superb, with active, effective ingredients in amounts that work. This cream is a great addition to the luminous line. skin looks radiant,has improved remarkably . It keeps my face hydrated, radiant, and makeup looks even better these products are luxurious and pamper my skin,without overspending or being mislead. I trust olay, and integrity of their brand and products"
"At first glance, I thought of the jar of cream my grandmother had on her vanity. I thought it was magic when I was a kid, but as an adult it didn't appeal. This is every bit the magic done properly! The texture is rich without being heavy, hydrating without being sticky. It feels like a far more expensive product with a subtle scent. The effects are exactly as promised but the experience of using it is a delight! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm really liking this product because it's very lightweight but moisturizes well. It also has SPF 25 so I'm not using another product. Most moisturizers with SPF don't blend well but this one is light as a feather. My makeup looks great since using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product leaves my skin smooth and soft. I like the light creamy feel of this product, but I LOVE the results I see from Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizer. After using it for a month, the small lines forming below my lips were gone and the lines above my lips were less apparent. The results from this product are not as dramatic. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Luminous Whip absorbs quickly, so there is little waiting time to apply make up. It did not moisturize my face well enough. During December in New York, my face needs more moisture than Whips provides. This would be a great product to use in warmer weather. I currently use Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream SPF 30. There is an Olay product for every skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product absorbs quickly leaving your face with a fresh feeling. A definite plus was one I didn't feel the product could deliver on, but it definitely helped minimize large pores. Would buy this produc. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the feel of my skin after applying this product. Alas, I'm still left with all my wrinkles, of course, but it seems to even out some imperfections. It smells amazing, making me smile as I apply it. The one negative comment I have is that it leaves my skin a little tight, feeling under moisterized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have never been able to use an overnight moisturizer. On the various times I have tried yet another new moisturizer, my face looked like an oil slick in the morning. Not with this one! It feels so light when applying, and almost feels like it disappears. I love knowing that I can now moisturize at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I first put this product on I was worried it wouldn't absorb into my skin. It almost felt like it was just a layer on top of my skin. I was so wrong! I love it! It moisturizes perfectly for wear during the day. The only negative is, while it smells wonderful, it's a bit too strong of a smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the Luminous Whip! My face feels so soft and has a brighter glow! I use it every morning before I apply my makeup and every night before I go to bed. It smells great, too! I am an Oil of Olay girl and I can't wait to try the other whipped products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay's luminous whip with SPF smells good, feels great and the texture is amazing - so soft, super light and moisturizing. It helps even my skin tone, making it look better & brighter. It quickly absorbs leaving no residual ""sticky"" feeling. The dry patches I get at the end of the day are nowhere to be found as my skin stays hydrated and smooth. This is a fantastic brightening moisturizer and you don't need to use much - a little goes a long way. Love, love, love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved using this Olay Luminous Whip face moisturizer so much! First of all the texture is very light weight. It has a light scent and smells good. My skin is always so much drier in the winter. My skin instantly soaked this up. My skin was so soft after applying it. It didn't wear off during the night or the next day. It's better than my high end name brand favorite moisturizer. The only problem I had was removing the cap off the bottle inside the lid. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great addition to my current skin care regimen. The feel of Olay Luminous Whip is just what I need for the cold weather. It smells really good. The best parts of it? I didn't have any breakouts (major points!) and it's great to layer with makeup. Yay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I normally have pretty sensitive skin, and after using Olay Luminous Whip, my skin felt very soft and moisturized. And I did not have any breakout or reaction to it. It has a nice smell, not overbearing. It absorbs well, without any residue. I plan to use my entire jar, and would definitely consider purchasing it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I usually use the Regenerist line and it is good at hydrating. This product was lighter in consistency and did absorb quickly but it did not make my skin feel moisturized. In fact, I have to reapply it 2-3 times to feel like I'm getting enough. Also, I did not like the scent although it did fade quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I don't usually like smells on my face but I love the smell of Whips. Of course you only smell it for a short time. I also love the feel of Whips on my face. It does not feel sticky at all throughout the day like other moisturizers. My skin feels silky smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This formula is super moisturizing and my skin stays soft from morning to late night. Non-greasy, smells yummy and I love the jar the cream is in. Nice packaging! Winter is here, so this new Whip cream is going to be the best icing on my face. Cheers and Thanks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Feels light and airy on my skin but my skin feels soft and moisturized. Some days I skip foundation after using the Luminous whip. I will definitely be buying more. This is one of the best moisturizers I've ever used! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product went on smooth and light. It was not oily and soaks into your skin. It's a wonderful product. I'm an older woman and Ive been using Oil of Olay since I was in my 20s. They make quality products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have always had oily skin. Even though I am a senior citizen I have to watch what I use on my face because everything I tried makes it more oily. This OLAY LUMINOUS WHIP makes my skin so soft without making it oily, and I can see the difference in the tone of my skin after only a short time. Try it you will be surprise!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this moisturizer. its smells very nice. It absorbs into skin leaving it soft and hydrated. I love the matte finish. it can be used with or without make up. I will repurchase and recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first saw this I was wondering if you would need a lot of product to get full coverage as it looked whipped and airy! It's actually a great combination of whipped and creamy, much thicker than it looks. It feels wonderful on my skin, soft, and silky - it seems to have a pearl-like finish, leaving your skin feeling powdery smooth! It works well on my face leaving it moisturized and hydrated but not at all sticky or greasy - absorbs very well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I definitely like Luminous Whip. I have sensitive skin that is prone to irritation when trying a new product. I didn't experience irritation with Whip. It is very comfortable on my skin. I am sensitive to scents & although I would prefer a fragrance free product, the scent of Whip didn't bother me. I especially like the matte finish. My T-zone usually needs some powder or foundation to eliminate shine, but not with Whip. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the feel on my skin. It goes on a light cream and absorbs quickly, leaving a smooth matte finish. I appreciate the spf 25 feature without any greasy or heavy feel. Another great addition to my Olay skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't think a 'whipped' moisturizer would really work, but Olay proved me wrong!!! It moisturizers all day, absorbs FAST, and is not greasy or oily on my skin. Light as feather. My skin looks brighter and nourished. Bravo, Olay!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use olay products every day and was excited to receive this new whipped formula. The texture of this cream took me by surprise. I was not expecting the look and feel of it because I'm use to the heavier consistency of regenerist micro-
sculpting cream. It felt smooth on my skin and I liked that it was not greasy. I have only used for a week so far so I don't feel qualified to express any visual results . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the Olay Luminous Whip Moisturizer; however, it does leave my skin feeling a bit dry. It absorbs very quickly, as promised, and I do like the light feel. I have not used long enough to see a change in the appearance of my skin, but will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the light smooth texture of this product. A little goes a long way, which is always appreciated. After the first week I really noticed that my skin was looking healthy and bright. Usually with no makeup it can look pretty dull and tired. I even left he house without any makeup, and that is a rare occurrence. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very smooth and does slightly reduce appearance of pores and even skin tone. However, it does not moisturize as well as Olay Complete. I found that combining the two products reduced the effectiveness of the Whip's intended benefits of reducing appearance of pores and the ""brightening"" effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the second time I'm doing this review. Don't know why they didn't receive my first one. Since using the Olay Whips moisturizer, my skin feels so smooth and soft. It is light weight and absorbs quickly and doesn't leave an oily feel after. I don't think I used it long enough to see how it works on my freckles yet. But I hope with continue use my freckles will be lighter. Overall, this moisturizer is a very good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is the best I have ever used in your line of cosmetics. I have used many of your products over the years, but have never been impressed by any of them the way I have been with this one. The moisturizing effect is fantastic and the feeling stays with you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer feels light, is not greasy. Matte finish makes my oily skin look less shiny all day long! Skin looked and felt smoother after one day; evened out skin tone and slight redness associated with Retin A. I would highly recommend Olay Luminous Whip moisturizer!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It is very light and non greasy and feels good. But I being a woman that's 65 and it being winter living in the northeast I prefer a heavier moisturizer. This product is great and would be great for a younger women also those living in a warmer climate. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really needed the Regenerest whip, but it was unavailable. However, I asked for the luminous whip and i like it, but I really need more moisturizing. I want to thank you for the free Whip. I love Olay products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay Whip feels very light and silky on my skin. It does not feel sticky or oily and my skin feels soft and hydrated all day. I like the added benefit of SPF 25 and also has a nice fragrance. I like the luminous line for their brightening and hydrating products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Overall the product is good. It leaves the skin smooth with a matte finish and is breathable and lightweight. The only issue I had is applying foundation after this cream. I could not spread it in. This moisturizer is good for days when you do not wish to use the makeup. It leaves the skin soft and supple but matte. So it is good for people with oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Olay products and was really curious about this new offering. When I opened the jar, I was skeptical about a product that was 'whipped' and whether it would follow through on the claims it made. I was dead wrong. This lighter than air whipped moisturizer does just that. Moisturizes!!!! it absorbs fast and doesn't leave a heavy, oily feel. It is light, makes my skin look 'fresh', and lasts all day. Bravo, Olay!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was hesitant with regards to the claim that this product minimized the appearance of pores; but I was surprised at how well the product did minimize pores when I used the product. The moisturizer does quickly absorb into the skin leaving my skin feeling soft. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a delightful new product. It is light and fluffy and feels very smooth on application. The fragrance is delicate and not overwhelming as in some creams on the market. I like this Olay product and will definitely buy it in the future. I have been using the Olay Regenerist cream for several years on my aging skin ( 69 years) and really love it. This Olay Whip makes a perfect companion to my Regenerist. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Immediately after putting this product on my face, it felt soft and moisturized. I particularly liked the fact that it did not have a perfume smell but most importantly it made my skin feel amazingly soft and illuminating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is lightweight and moisturizing. I love the lightweight feel and how it makes my skin feel smooth, soft and moisturized. This product has a light fresh sent. I also love the SPF 25 to protect my skin from sun damage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Have only been using this for a little over a week and already seeing improvement in my skin. Increased firmness and even tone. Feels moisturized and soft. Hard to give up my beloved regenerist to give this a try for awhile, but glad I did. Only one suggestion: how about a fragrance-free version? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This Whip Moisturizer works great as a layering product. It absorbed so quickly and left my skin feeling so soft and smooth. My only concern is that the product comes in a jar and I shy away from open containers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was hesitant to try another hydration lotion at night, but I am glad I did. I have oily skin, but I did not wake up with my face looking like an oil slick. This lotion feels very nourishing when applied, yet feels like you have nothing on your face. I love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love Olay Luminous whip it smells amazing and I really like that it's lightweight it doesn't feel heavy or oily on my face . my face feels really soft after putting hit on and what I really love is at the end of the day my face does not feel oily. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product feels amazing because it feels so light on your skin. You can feel and see the difference in your skin right away. Your skin feels vibrant and healthy and looks amazing! It absorbs instantly and never feels greasy or heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just received this product in the mail last Friday but prior to getting the email, I was not aware of this product. I have tried it a few time and it feels very light and smooth on the skin and I love the fact that it contains SFP 25, higher than the other Olay products I use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Smells & feels great. Don't like the inner seal lid. Difficult to open with the tiny raised tab in the center. Like the other Olay products inner lid much better as they're easier to open with the lift tab by the rim. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
From the first use my skin felt smooth and silky and gets better with each use. The redness has diminished and my overall coloring is much more uniform. By far the most effective product I have tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The texture of the Whip moisturizer is super light and it left my face matte and feeling like velvet. It works well under makeup, without primer, and keeps me matte all day. I have fairly oily skin and I love that I can skip the extra step of a primer because that sometimes makes me even more oily. Plus, the Whip does minimize pores and I usually can't use those types of primers without breaking out. Love this stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is like satin on your skin. Visible results almost immediately. One thing I would like to see is a fragrance free version. With my allergies almost any scent no matter how light can be annoying to my head and nose. I love this product but do wish it cost a little less. When your on a fixed income this is a little pricey. But it is a wonderful cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is light, fluffy and airy. Perfect for summer but thick enough barrier cream to where in the winter. I've always loved your products and have been using them since I was stationed in Germany in 1989. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way this feels and it goes on very smoothly. I would definitely buy this product. It feels very light on my face and it's just another great product in your line. I have been using Olay for years and no one thinks I look my age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like the luminous facial oil treatment better than the whip but I've started using the oil during the day and the whip at bedtime. So far it seems to be ok. I really plan to finish the jar Olay sent me to have a better opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product smells amazing and feels really nice on the skin. It goes on very smoothly without any rubbing and a little bit goes a long way. I am 75 years old and having been using Oil of Olay since I was 17. I love this new product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love how this feels on the skin! Fresh scent and smooth finish. Did not notice any change in skin tone or minimizing of pores. Like the concept, but I think I will stay with the Olay Regenerist Line as I like the results of the serum better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It smells great but it wasn't as moisturizing as I expected. I also didn't feel like there was any luminous effect on my skin. I might need to try another line from Olay. I really appreciate the sample -- Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Noticeable difference in my skin tone after just one week. I usually always buy unscented but the fragrance of this product was very light and pleasant smelling. I would recommend this product to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like how the top of the cream has a little notch in it to lift it off to expose the product. It makes it much easier to grab that thin piece of plastic. The cream itself is nice, not too thick, not too thin. I like a day cream that has SPF protection and this one has 25, which is good. I also like a day cream that is smooth and easily soaks into the skin, which this does. The last feature that makes this a great choice for a day cream is that it smells fresh and clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product failed to live up to the Olay standard. Olay, is my go to regarding beauty products so I'm familiar with the quality. Although, the Luminous Whip smelled amazing the cream itself failed in quality. I moisturized after washing my face and each time was left with an unexplainable residue: product was not used long enough to determine effectiveness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the Olay Whips moisturizer. It's light weight, absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a shiny look on my skin. My skin feels very soft and smooth. I only used it 3 days so it didn't lighten my freckles yet. Hoping with continue use they will be a little lighter. Overall a very good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is light with just right scent. Goes on so smooth and feel like skin is hydrated! Love it use it morning and night . I would expect nothing less than perfect from Olay which I have been using for a long time! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"What I love about this is that when you apply it to your skin it absorbs instantly. My face feels so soft and looks amazing. Softens the fine lines and brightens. I use little makeup on a daily basis, Just a little blush. This is a moisturizer I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is very light. It doesn't feel heavy on your skin. It brightens while providing moisture. I wish you had a men's line my husband likes every olay product of mine that he sneaks and uses (winking eye) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay Luminous Whip is the Product I would have designed for myself! It is much lighter than Olay Luminous Brightening & Protecting Lotion with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30. A little goes a long way so it is budget friendly, and it melts into the skin quickly. Be careful around your eyes; do not use it as an eye cream, as it may sting. Use an Olay Eye Cream designed for that thin, delicate skin around your eyes.Great job, Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Luminous Whip seems to go on a little dryer than the Luminous product (Olay) I have used for several years. It dries faster too. I really cannot talk about effectiveness because I haven't used it long enough. I think all Olay products are a value, and every bit as effective as most department store products, and the jars they come in are beautiful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using play since I was a teen and Inhave very bad allergies to perfume and other smells, I actually love this one it's so smooth when I put it on my face, I put it on at night and next day my face still is smooth especially when I wash my face. Thanks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product has a fantastic feel! The only thing missing is more moisture especially since it's getting to be winter time and my skin is thirsty. This will be my go-to moisturizer for the spring & summer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love everything about this Olay product, from the amazing performance of the moisturizer to the sleek design of the jar! The texture and feel of the product on my 57 year old skin is amazing; lightweight and so creamy. It soaks in almost instantly and doesn't leave behind any greasiness or oily film. Would definitely purchase again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Makes me look and feel younger. My skin is healthier.
this item sucks and they should take it off the shelves
