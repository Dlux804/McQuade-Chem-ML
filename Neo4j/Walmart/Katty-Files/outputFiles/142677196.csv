"AVEENO...bring this back to the retail market!! The ""new"" Intensive Night Cream w/ Vit. B3 that Positively Radiant has out does not compare with the original formula......"
"I love this cream. I get a pimple if anyone says the word pimple ( i hope i don't get one now) but this cream has worked great with me. I was scared to use night cream along with a day cream this is totally different. This cream is very lightweight, and extremely hydrating! Honestly I wake up, look in the mirror and LOVE how great my skin looks at 7AM! I recommend this night cream, along with Aveeno to EVERYONE."
This product goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly without leaving any residue. It has been very gentle on my skin while performing as expected. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product feels wonderful on my face. Absorbs well. My skin is sensitive and it still works good on it. Looks terrific when I awake too. You will be happy with this purchase. Great hydration!
"I have sensitive, dry skin and have a hard time finding products that don't sting or cause redness. This has a fantastic gel-cream texture that's still hydrating enough for my dry skin. I really like that it has a light, fresh fragrance and yet doesn't irritate my skin. I haven't been using it long enough to know if it will even my skin tone, but it's a nice night-time moisturizer that I'll continue to use."
"I have been using this product for about 2 weeks . The first day I used it i saw a difference. One thing you must remember is to be consistent with your skin care regimen. I absolutely love this overnight facial cream. It's light, not sticky, and it's very soothing to the skin. When you wake up , I'm telling you , your face is brighter and smoother than ever. I am in love with this. This product will not irritate you at all and I have very sensitive skin. So please by all means, give this a try. I am sure you will love it."
"I'm very dedicated to a certain skincare product..., but I found this tester inside of a magazine."
Wow! My face was glowing the next day. Guess I'll be adding this to my skincare routine. The best part is it isn't sticky and it didn't burn my eyes.
Thanks!
"Just like it says ""non-greasy"" formula.....This is fantastic. Absorbs quickly. I do not understand why the directions say 2-3 times a week tho. Do not understand how people have 'breakouts' or rashes with your other products either unless they have an unknown allergy to the botanicals placed in them. I love your products"
What I didn't like that was I paid $3 more that the MSRP at the local chain pharmacy
I have sensitive skin so I have to be very careful what I use on my face especially. I received a sample in my #walmartbeautybox and used about a nickel sized amount after my shower before bed. It went on smoothly but after about five minutes I had to rinse it off. My eyes started burning and watering and my nose ran like a fountain. Even after washing my face it took about 12 hours for the symptoms to dissipate.
"I bought this a month ago after using the intensive night cream for a few years. However, as soon as I started using this new product my face started to break out in huge pimples. Took a break from it for about 1 week and they disappeared. Used it 2 nights in a row again and a big pimple has formed."
Its light and feels nice on skin. I have sensetive skin and there was no irretation or increase on break outs however i haven't used it long enough to notice a difference in tone ir s more even complexion like soy extract is supposed to help with so o can't say if its worth the price which to me is more expensive then products i normally buy
"I am a fan of every product in the Positively Radiant line I've tried so far, but this one is my favorite! It smells great, it's very soothing to the skin and light, and when I wake up in the morning my skin has a dewy look to it, and feels really soft the entire day and into the next. The price is not bad, either, as the little tub lasts a long time...I've been using it every two to three nights for three weeks and have over half still to use! I will definitely be using this for a long time to come!"
My skin is very soft and hydrated. I know good skin comes from my gene-pool but Aveeno Skin Moisturizer works. It does not feel greasy or heavy.
This product made my face feel amazing! My skin was so soft and it smelled very pleasant! Didn't make my face oily or anything!!
"I bought both morning and night radiant moisturizer with excitement. After two tries, I developed a rash on my face. It is very disappointing ! I am not sure what ingredients this moisturizer has that make my skin develop a rash. !"
Great price and seems to work better than really expensive products
This helps me alot. I just started using ig snd csn already feel the difference and see it!
I really did like this product and would recommend it. Did not leave my skin feeling oily or too dry. No breakouts.
It's very light does not feel oily and makes your skin feel sucky smooth and firm when you wake up in the morning
"Moisturizing, absorbs pretty quickly into skin and the consistency of the cream is nice without it being too thick. Love the mild scent. I was careful not to get any product near my eyes as instructed. It would have been nice to have something that works all over the face. I have oily combination skin and did not experience any breakouts after starting this product which is always a plus for acne prone skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

It isn't too greasy and doesn't leave a mark on pillows which I really liked. I feel that in the morning my skin was well hydrated and it evened out skin moisture and dry spots. Overall I really liked it, I would need to use it in the summer to tell if it was too heavy for summer months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I've tried several new facial moisturizers this year. Aveno's Positively Radiant Overnight Hydrating Facial Moisturizer has been my second favorite.

"My skin feels moisturized after using this, but I think it's a stretch to call it an overnight facial, especially when the Aveeno in-shower facial product feels more like a facial. To me, it's an overnight deep moisturizer. That being said, during Winter, it has been nice to have more moisture and I do feel like this product gives me moisturized, healthy skin.

I received a free sample of Aveeno Positively Radiant Overnight Hydrating Facial Moisturizer, and let me tell you..My skin has never felt this much moisture and hydration from a skin care product.

This is a pretty good product. I applied it after using the 60 second in shower facial. It was very soothing and I could feel the moisture sinking in right away. Didn't much care for the texture of the cream but a little goes a long way. My skin was still moisturized when I woke up the next morning. That's a big plus. Thanks again for wonderful products Aveeno [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is great to apply after the 60 second facial cleanser. Again the smell of both these products is awesome. My skin looks, feels, and smells fresh and clean.

I absolutely love this line and will continue to use going forward. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When you first open the container you get a strong scent that left me a little nervous about. After applying it to my face I felt like my face was a little tight and felt a semi sticky feeling on me that bothered me since I just took a shower and was going to bed. I'm not blown away by this but I'm not completely disgusted. I wouldn't run right out to the store to purchase it instead of my currently nighttime moisturizer.

"I use this product after I wash my face, I have two different facial moisturizer, but since I started using the Aveeno Hydrating Facial Moisturizer i stop using my other one.

This is a great duo with the in-shower 60 second facial cleanser!! After I use that product I dry my face and lightly add the Aveeno POSITIVELY RADIANT Overnight Hydrating Facial Moisturizer to my face.

I have had skin issues my whole life with breakouts and this has cleared my face up and I now even feel comfortable enough to go without makeup!!!! The difference in my skin still amazes me!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Since this product is supposed to be put on before bed the first night I didn't even look at it as I was putting it on. But it felt so cool on my face and my face just drank it up and enjoyed it so much. The next time I used it I enjoyed it even more because the product is so pretty. It has sparkles in it and made me feel like I was putting fairy dust on my face. I love it and am excited to see how using it for a few more weeks will make my face look and feel.
