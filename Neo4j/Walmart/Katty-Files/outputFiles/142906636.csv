I received this as a gift and it really has helped my skin go from the Sahara Desert to the lush tropics in just a few days! I really like how it speaks on smooth and a little goes a very long way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When I saw the ad in a magazine I wanted to try it. Could not find it in store so I bought it online. I have combination (oily and dry) skin.... Especially in the winter months. This works great! I don't look 'greasy'. Skin feels great too....Not dry and rough. I use this in the morning and after washing my face at night.
"I was looking for a very good moisturizer with Hyaluronic acid. I use retinol at night so it is a fine line between too dry and okay. This is a great day moisturizer that sets up well under my makeup. I am seeing more hydrated skin, which means less obvious lines, particularly near my eyes. I would purchase again."
"I got my free trial packet, loved it, went to store and bought it, have been completely satisfied. It's light and smooth, doesn't feel greasy, just hydrates beautifully. I've tried a lot of moisturizer, but this is a total winner. I may need to try the pot for extra dry skin in winter, but the normal to dry is fabulous right now. Recommended my daughter try the normal to oily. . . Loreal always has good products, but hydro genius is a true winner. Love this moisturizer!!!"
"This stuff is great! It made my skin feel rejuvenated. I have extremely dry patches on my face and this balances it out, and the best part? It wasn't greasy!!! It was silky!!! (it has a wonderful smell as well) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just got it in the mail and opened it up my first reaction was this lotion smells amazing! I put some on while reading the box and it says that the skin is immediately soft and skin is comfortable soothed and nourished with moisture. I can immediately feel all of these things. Will write another review but had to put my first reaction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Okay, I've been using this a few days now, twice a day. And well, my dry skin issue is solved, now am having trouble with the oilyness or shiny look to my skin! Love that my face is no longer dry and itchy, thinking I need to apply less of this at night to avoid the shiny look, though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"great great great product i just love it my skin is dry to normal you can feel that softness in your skin, if a friend ask me about a good cream i will rec emend it to theme with my personal experience its really good product i love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's a great product. Didn't cause any breakouts. It's really refreshing. Just like getting out of the shower but it looks kind of oily on the skin and I don't like that. So I just use a very small amount and only before going to sleep. I didn't really see any significant difference on the appearance of my skin but it does feel better right away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'll get right to the point the only thing that will make it better is included sun protection. I absolutely love the thickness of this product, I love the gentle scent, I love how t makes my skin feel so refreshed. The past few weeks I've been using it my skin has become brighter, a lot less flaky, and my foundation goes on much more smoothly now. I've recommended this product to multiple people who have complained of their skin dryness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care Extra Dry Skin was ok on its own, but amazing when pair with another moisturizer. When I first put it on it was fine, but after few minutes, it was not enough for skin. So the way I have been use it is after I wash my face I will apply Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care than I will apply my normal moisturizer mix with argan oil it work wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer had a subtle pleasant scent that was not overpowering. The moisturizer was not too greasy, and I could easily apply my SPF afterwards. My skin felt soft and smooth after a couple of applications! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The extra dry formula feels like a cross between a gel and a cream. It absorbs easily and doesn't leave my combination skin greasy in my t-zone. Since I started using this product, my acne started healing much faster. I use lots of topical products that can be irritating and drying. The extra dry formula helps combat those adverse affects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried this moisturizer since I have dry skin and I have felt like my skin has taken a glass of water feeling super hydrated, the only bad part about it it's that it's heavely scented :( but it does have a nice scent to it just felt like a bit too strong! I have used this face cream and my dry patchy skin has gone away! It's awesome [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the feel of this product. It's very creamy and not thin. When I get it on my finger it doesn't drop off. It runs in well. My skin feels hydrated and nourished. I use it morning and night. I don't think it will lay 72hrs like it claims. I don't particularly love the smell. It's a little too flowery for me. But I don't hate it either. I like the container that it comes in. Easy to open and to use. Overall I believe it's a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Care for extra dry skin as the summer months are generally not very kind to my skin. After reading the reviews for this product I was hopeful that my dry skin concerns would be a thing of the past. Unfortunately, this was not the case. I can't tell any difference after almost 4 weeks of use. On a positive note, the fragrance of this product is phenomenal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has been great for my extra-dry skin! It smells great and sinks into the skin nicely. It is a little thicker than you're typical moisturizer, but for very dry skin that is helpful! Good base layer for foundation and make-up as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"For the past two and a half months, I've been traveling, which has taken a toll on my skin. After using this product for about two weeks, I really feel a huge change in my skin. My skin feels better than it did before I started traveling. Such a great product, especially for those with dry skin, like myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a few small dry patches on my face and this product has been so wonderful. It is recommended that you use it twice a day but I have seen great results using it just once a day. And for someone who has sensitive skin, I have had no irritation from using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal Hydra genius Daily care moisturizer is absolutely perfect for my dry skin. I use it every morning and night. My face hasn't looked this hydrated in a very long time. The scent and viscosity are lovely and I don't feel as if it's thick on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Hydra Genius is a great new addition to my skincare regimen. It smells incredible and keeps my skin supple and moisturized. The cream is thick and rich. When I first opened the jar I was surprised at how thick and luxurious the cream felt. It is much thicker than other creams I have used. I love it as a night cream. The smell gives me sweet dreams and I wake up to soft skin. I would definitely buy this cream again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoy using this cream. I use it day and night It hydrates my dry skin without making it feel greasy. The only thing it's missing is a sunscreen in it. Otherwise I love it and will continue to use it and apply a separate sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This hydrating cream is perfect when your skin feels super dry and tight. Once you put it on, it's like your skin just instantly soaks it all up. It's great! It has a pleasant smell, A little goes a long way and it didn't make my skin break out. Im definitely recommending this to my friends with dry skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What I really liked was that it hydrated my skin without feeling greasy or thick. I really loved the smell too! My face was super dry due to drinking too much coffee and not enough water. I applied it at night, after washing my face, before bed. I would also apply a small amount in my really dry areas before applying my makeup in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is amazing! I usually have oily skin, but during the winter my skin gets very dry. I use this product after I have washed my face and it instantly melts into my skin. It dries quickly and it leave my face soft, moistured, and with a glow! This product does have a smell to it but the smell is pleasant. I highly recommend this product. I will defentily continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have combo skin so this was a great night time replenishment cream. I got the extra dry skin formula for some reason so I'm not able to truly review this being I don't have dry skin. I did use it a few times for night time like I said and it did really well for that. It has a light fragrance so if you are sensitive to smell this might not be for you. It's super creamy but not heavy. I would love to try this in the formula for oily skin and give it a better review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm very picky with my skincare. I tend to go for the same products and rarely venture out, but I'm glad I did. This moisturizer was lightweight but moisturizing and I love that it didn't have a gross smell like many others do. Overall, I would say this is a great product and the fact that it's drugstore just makes it even better! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have combination skin, and this moisturizer was absolutely perfect for my dry spots. My skin is super sensitive, so I was a little hesitant on trying a new product, but it was awesome and didn't make me break out! It also smells soooooo amazing -- please make this into a fragrance ;) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got the extra dry lotion but I actually have normal/combination skin. I used this after a shower, before bed and it went on smoothly with a barely noticeable scent. It didn't feel heavy nor greasy and I woke up with nice smooth skin. I was afraid it would make me greasy since it isn't really for my skin type but it didn't. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed the smell of the moisturizer, I how ever didn't love how it felt once it was applied. I don't like being able to feel the moisturizer once it's on. It felt a little heavy so I ended up only using it at night. And that was fine. But for me it was way to heavy for day time use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So, upon reading the ingredients, I wasn't too crazy about it. Mineral oil is something I always try to steer clear of but it's really high on the list! I tried the product anyway. It is pretty hydrating and luckily it didn't irritate my skin. With the added dimethicone, it gives your complexion a clearer, smoother look as well. I have pretty dry skin but felt that this worked almost like the thicker moisturizers that I own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like L'Oreal Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care and I give it all 5 stars because I think it deserves it. It has such a attractive smell, the texture is smooth and goes onto skin so softly and smooth. I really see a difference using this product. I've tried many moisturizers but this one works very well. I will be buying it in stores, and recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this everyday since I got it almost 2 weeks ago. My skin has always been super dry and flaky. I have noticed that it hasn't been flaky at all for over a week now. It is starting to become very soft. I have tried many products before and now have seen to work as good. I would definitely recommend giving it a try if you have very dry skin. My skin has always been very sensitive as well and it responded well with this lotion [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care for Extra Dry Skin and I am impressed! I have been struggling with very dry skin all winter and nothing was helping so I was excited to try this. It packs a whole lot of moisture in a cream that feels light on the skin. I have been using it twice a day and have saw a huge improvement. I especially like the way it looks under my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought this product a month ago & I am so happy I did. My skin is softer brighter & may I add younger looking well worth the price.
I really do like this product. It is super effective for dry skin. I did notice that my skin was noticeable smoother than before. I also liked the smell of the product. I usually apply it onto my skin before putting on foundation.
The packaging was very nice and the product itself is very lightweight on my face I didn't have to worry about my face being dry so or too oily it was just right also that lasted all day . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Great value [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really think this moisturizer is a great option for dry skin for before makeup. I always washed my face, exfoliated, moisturized and then primed but sometimes I have dry patches. This moisturizer really helps makeup blend and it helps sooth my dry spots. The scent reminds me of something expensive but I wish it was less scented. It just doesn't need the added fragrance in my opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how it keep my skin hydrated. I have very dry skin so this product help on keep my skin hydrated and smooth throughout my day. I don't need to constantly reapplying to keep my skin from being dry. My sister can't wit to try it because she suffer from the same thing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think everyone will love this product. This product is lightweight and the smell is soothing. It really hydrates and rejuvenated my skin. I love the smell and that it wasn't over powering. Its not thick so after applying it you won't feel heavy or sticky. After applying it you feel refreshed and the moisture in your skin being replenished! I love the way it feels on my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the Smell of L'Oréal's Extra Genius , you can smell the aloe. It is very hydrating and goes on smooth on your face. It definitely lasts all day long too. I would definitely purchase this and refer to a friend because of all of the benefits it has to your skin. It is slightly tacky when you first put it on, so you do need to let it absorb into your skin. My face feels hydrated and smooth after continuously usin it every morning and night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was so excited to try this it says it's for extra dry skin (which I do not have) but it somehow wasn't hydrating enough for my skin even. The smell is absolutely amazing but the formula isn't what I expected [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product has a pleasant scent and smooth texture. I have ""normal"" skin, not too oily/ not to dry and to be honest, I did not notice a huge difference in this product compared to other moisturizing creams I've used in the past. It does moisturize your skin, however I personally did not feel like the product did anything particularly special. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got a free sample of Loreal's Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care for extra dry skin and I loved it so much I went out and bought it that day. zit keeps your skin feeling super moisturized, soft, and smooth. It dries fast and does not feel sticky at all, great to use alone or under make-up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I was kinda skeptical about using this. My face is always dry and I thought just another product that's not gonna work. Boy was I shocked! The first time I put it on it was awesome. My face was soft and I thought ok well it's just the first application. Well if it's like this on the first one it will probably get better. Yup I was right. I really like this stuff. I would definitely recommend Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care. Will be buying this again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this! It is so cooling light but mega hydrating. My sis and other family commented on how ""fresh"" my face looked! I do not have mega dry skin but I loved it anyway as it was hydrating but not greasy and absorbed into my skin very fast. My mother used it when I stayed over and loved it so much she kept it. I bought another! Totally loved the Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care Extra Dry Skin formula! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great moisturizer for extra dry skin. I have very dry skin in addition to living in a super dry desert climate (Arizona). This summer has been unusually dry and hot and this moisturizer has kept my face moisturized and feeling hydrated all day. It also has a great lightweight consistency, it is not heavy or oily feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found that this product didn't really do anything different for me. The product has a great scent, the packaging is a bit deceiving because the glass is very heavy, making you believe there is more product than there actually is inside. I have dry skin and often have dry patches on my face. This product didn't provide extra hydration or do anything for the dry patches. I gave two stars for the scent and that's about it. I wouldn't purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this product for 7 days and noticed a drastic change in the way my skin looked and feels. It looks more vibrant and young and keeps my face clear of dry skin. The only downside was that I wasn't a big fan of the smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care For Extra Dry Skin smells incredible and works really well. I always use it after I take a shower in certain dry spots on my face and it seems to do a really good job. It doesn't seem to help much if you have an already dry spot though, the spot has to be cleaned first. Also i really love the smell of it but it does get really strong when using it on your face. Otherwise i really like the product and would definitely recommend to my friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far this cream is amazing ! I live in Texas and with the high temperatures and hot sun, I'm always looking for a cream that's extra nourishing without clogging my pores or being too thick to wear under my makeup . This cream is versatile and is recommended for both night and day use , I've only been using it for a few days but couldn't wait to put the word out that my skin is smooth and glowing .. going to review again with pics of before and after in 4 weeks ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I absolutely love Hydra Genius! I recently got a really bad sun burn and started peeling on my face really badly. I got the Hydra Genius and used it a few times throughout the day and it helps so much! My skin didn't look so flaky and dry, it was nice and soft, very smooth! Something I definitely recommend getting not only for sunburn peeling skin but for any type of dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Let me start by saying how much softer and glowing my skin feels and looks. It's a natural healthy glow. Not over oily does not leave residues. Just great healthy looking skin. So in love with this product. Yes I will be using it regularly as a part of my clean healthy natural face routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am very pleased with L'oréal Hydra Genuis Daily Moisturizer. Within just a few minutes of use, my skin is plumper yet firm, & more youthful & radiant. It actually feels quenched! Although the extra dry skin formulation sits a little heavy on the skin, which is to be expected, it leaves your skin with a silky smooth hydrated feel once it absorbs that seems to last all day long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think L'Oreal Hydra Genius for Extra dry skin is simply amazing. Its by far my favorite skin moisturizer. Leaves my skin silky smooth for hours, without the oily feeling. I recommend this wonderful product to anyone and everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is one of the best moisturizing lotions/creams I have ever used! The day I received this in the mail, my hands were super dry, so I thought what the heck! Put just a little on my ands and it is no joke, they were rejuvenated immediately! It has made my skin so soft, and the smell is wonderful as well! I really love this one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturiser! I tend to have really dry skin in the winter, and this lotion definitely seems to help. It doesn't leave a greasy feeling behind. Nice light scent. I do think it's important to note the size- it's only 1.7oz! That would be fine if it was just a night cream, but it's supposed to be day/night. If you use it twice a day it definitely won't last very long! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i very like this cream. Since i get it i use only this product. Its make my skin mouster and super soft for while at least 24h its keep my skin feel good. This cream not greasy and stiky. Right after i put it its gone and left only good soft feelings and nice smel on my face. I recomend this cream for daily routin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have a dry T zone. My nose tends to peel more than I'd like especially when the rest of my face seems smooth. After using this product I was able to see a difference in my peeling skin. I've even gotten compliments on my healthy looking skin. However, it only lasted maybe 40 hours not 72 as stated on the box. But still awesome!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It definitely helped with the dry areas on my face very quickly. Even if I missed a day they wouldn't appear like they normally do. It didn't cause any breakouts and that is usually a concern with face creams. I do however feel like I had to use a bit extra than I would with my regular product. Overall a very nice moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am really pleased with this product so far. Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and I can't feel any oily or sticky residue after putting it on.

"I love the L'Oréal Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care. It came in a cute lititle glass jar with a sky blue lid. A dab was all I needed to keep my hands soft and moisturized for all day. That's something I need for my dry skin. And I love that it gives my skin a nice warm glow. Let's not forget about the fragrance, it was so light and flowery and sort of like fresh linen. I couldn't stop smelling my hands. I can't rave enough about this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It has a nice clean smell that goes away when it dries. It's thick but not too thick; just thick enough to know it's there. It feels really good on the skin. I have not really noticed a change in my skin but it is still early. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Smells amazing, and light weight. I was sent for dry skin and was afraid it was going to leave a really oily residue after applying, it didn't! In fact it helped so much being in February and skin is dry I even used on my legs and worked better than lotions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only used the product last night and this morning, so far I like the results. My face looks more hydrated and more moisturized, I really like the smell of the cream too it smells like aloe.

"I loooove this product! It is in a jar(so hard to find), it smells heavenly, hydrates my very dry skin and helps my redness. I have always had dry skin, even in the summer. No matter what I put on my skin it is flaky and I can't wear makeup. I also have redness and spots which lessened in just a few days of wearing. I also love the smell! It isn't overly scented. It has just the right amount. So pleased with my Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using this nightly, and I have really gotten to love the lightweight yet moisturizing effects of this moisturizer! The texture is almost like a serum in my opinion, but still feels great. For me it has a slight tingly effect which I actually really like. However, in the winter I think I would have to switch to my regular nightly face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this cream. It goes on nicely, absorbs quickly, has a pleasant smell. I think it really hydrated my skin without any unpleasent residue or overwhelming scent. My skin just felt cool and hydrated. This has been my favorite new item. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Hydra Genius for the past few weeks and have really enjoyed it. I think the lotion is kind of heavy, good for very dry skin, but I only have been using it at night because it feels too heavy for the daytime. My other qualm is that the lotion doesn't have sunscreen in it, I prefer sunscreen in my daytime lotion. Overall, if you have very dry skin - this is a great lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I lately have been struggling with dry patches on my face and haven't been able to fine a moisturizer that balances out my skin until now! Using this product nightly has me waking up with beautiful evenly moisturized skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very impressed! I have dry skin, but my face is also very oily so I was a little wary about how it would affect my skin. I was pleased to discover it hydrated my skin nicely and also didn't turn my face into a oil slick theory minutes after application. I was a little taken aback by the smell, I wasn't expecting it to be so strong. However, it quickly dissipated a few minutes after application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So since it's summer and those days in the sun. My skin becomes dry and this has helped my skin stay hydrated. It's lightweight and feels wonderful on my face. I have tried many skin items and this has been an awesome product. Would recommend for anyone who has that extra dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have combination skin and this helps a multitude of areas. Even though it advertises it is for Extra Dry Skin it's light formula won't feel heavy or greasy on your skin. The lotion also plays nice with the rest of my skin by hydrating just enough and not clogging my pores.
"I think this is one of the best moisturizers that i have used in a very long time! my forehead and the area around my mouth are always dry and sometimes flaky. But since using this product, i haven't experienced any flakiness or major dryness! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have super dry skin and nothing I have used in the past has helped my skin truly feel moisturized. I use this product morning and night and before I do my makeup and it has prevented my skin from peeling and making my skin look and feel uncomfortable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great product for those looking for serious, hydrating skin care products. It has a very smooth and creamy texture and a very light, clean fragrance. It gives the instant feel of deep hydration. This is definitely replacing my current moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So I tried L'oreals new Hydra Genius extra dry skin moisturizer and I would say that it has not that bad. The formula is pretty think, which I like because it lasts longer. They don't lie about the 72 hours because I haven't applied it in like 2 and a half days and my skin still looks and feels good. The thing I dint like about it is that because it's so thick, putting it on, it made my skin look greasy. Other that everything was good, and a little bit of this stuff really Does go a long way.

"L'Oreal Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care Moisturizer is fantastic. It's a great formula that provides plenty of moisture. It's the best thing that I've came across yet for my dry skin. My skin felt fresh, smooth, and very soft but never greasy or oily after using this. I am absolutely in love with this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got the extra dry skin jar of this product. It wasn't the ideal product for me because I have a combination/oily skin. I liked how it moisturized my skin, but I wish it was lighter. I was surprised it didn't make me more greasy than I usually am. The product makes my skin feel nice after I use it, but I took off one star for alcohol being the 4th and mineral oil the 5th ingredient in the list.

"I have been using this for a week now and I love it. I have dry skin and while I have used other daytime moisturizers, this L'Oréal one actually leaves my face feeling so hydrated while with others the feeling would go away after a few minutes. With this moisturizer my face looks and feels so soft and dewy the whole day. Plus it makes makeup application look better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product goes on so smoothly and leaves the skin very soft. I received the extra dry skin version even though my skin is normal but it still made my skin feel hydrated (not overly hydrated!). It's a good night cream versus day cream because it does leave the face slightly shiny after application. I would be eager to try the normal skin to see if it would be a better fit for my skin type. The container is large and will definitely last a long time! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had some doubts about this product but it actually works. My faces is moisturized all day. I'm not concerned about dry skin when I'm on the go. It's compact so it fits right in my purse. It smells nice it doesn't have any chemical smells. I'd recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that the Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care Extra Dry Skin is a great face lotion! It's not heavy or thick like some face lotions. It doesn't clog pores or make my skin oily. I have really dry skin, so I put it on at night before going to bed and my face feels soft when I wake up. It smells good too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It was very moisturizing! While using this product, my dry patches went away and my skin didn't peel like it normally does. It has a nice mild smell. I really liked the ingredients list and felt good about using it on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am in love with this product. After using it for few days I can tell a difference on my skin. The smell is so refreshing and smells wonderful after applying then the next day my skin felt so soft and smooth. I will continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this product for about two weeks now and I really like it! It's very moisturizing and hydrating without being greasy. I have dry skin and it does feel smoother now that I've used this product. Also, unlike other night time moisturizers I've used, this product does not cause me to break out. Because of these reasons, I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the product designated for extra dry skin which I think was a mistake as I have more of a combination skin type. It was a little too greasy for my skin but I will definitely be trying this for the normal skin type! While I discontinued use on my face, I've been using it as a body lotion and it is wonderful! It's really hydrating and I like the scent but it's a little stronger than I like for my face. I look forward to trying this on my skin in the dryer, winter months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is one of the best moisturizing products I have used. My face feels very soft and looks smooth after using the Hydra Genius. This product can be used for all skin types...mine tends to be dry. I will definitely purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is really great. I have super dry flaky skin and after using this morning and night my skin is super soft. The formula is a little thick so I may end up only using it at night. I wish it contained some SPF so I don't have to apply any in the morning but otherwise great product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am so impressed with this moisturizer. I have pretty normal skin, but in the Arizona summer, everyone needs an extra boost of moisturizer. Enter Loreal Hydra Genius! The product is smooth and absorbs quickly, and the moisture lasts all day. My skin is plump and it helps lessen wrinkles. It's a great base for makeup, and mine didn't look cakey or slick afterwards. The fragrance is light, and not annoying or overpowering. I am glad to have tried this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is awesome. Its smells great and I noticed results the 1st time I used it. My skin immediately felt softer, refreshed and I was glowing. I loved it so much, I'm using it on my hands too! Great product and I would definitely recommend to anyone that needs relief from dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal Paris Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care has become my favorite part of my facial cleansing routine. The cream is very lightweight and gentle but with such a nice silky texture, it leaves my skin feeling so clean and soft. It has a nice fresh fragrance, too. Washing my face and removing my makeup has always felt like a bit of a chore to me, but I actually look forward to doing it now because my skin feels so good afterwards. I would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this moisturiser. I have really dry skin and this worked great with my skin. I like how it doesn't apply oily and isn't heavy. This is a great summer cream. I also like how it's unscented and doesn't smell artificial. I would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Before using this product I saw it the store and really wish to try it. My skin is extremely dry even in summer. I have to use moisturizer to keep my skin hydrate. The hydra genius liquid care is just amazing. It keeps my skin so soft and smooth. The overall texture looks much better too. It absorbs quickly without making my skin oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the Hydra Genius is awesomely great. It gives that extra hydration it said it does. It feels comfortable and is an instant hydration. It can be use before makeup and at night before going to bed. It has a slight smell not too fan about it. I have very dry skin and its my go go for now. I have been crazy to try out this product. The size is not that big, but a little goes a long way. Recommend for extra dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This everything and more! L'Oréal Skin Expert Paris introduces Hydra Genius for different skin types. I got mine for extra dry skin. I absolutely love it. I have very sensitive skin and prone to brakeouts but I also get dry skin. This product smells light and crisp. I always feel refreshed after putting it on. It's like a boots to my skin. Thank you so much, I usually buy expensive brands but this is one I'll for sure be buying often. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have horribly dry skin. It is so dry that it cracks and flakes easily and never feels moisturized or hydrated. This product is exactly what I needed to re-hydrate and freshen. My husband even had to try some and he loves it too! The Hydra Genius is just what my body needed to combat my excessively dry skin. Now I have to fight my husband for it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product will last a while. I barely have to use any to achieve moisturized skin. There is a slightly greasy feel but not like other moisturizers I have tried. It does absorb quickly and has a nice smell. My skin has not had any peeling since using it. I normally have dry spots around my nose. After a few days of using, my skin does feel amd look healthier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm always searching for that perfect moisturizer because my skin is very dry and most moisturizers seem to coat the skin but not necessarily provide the moisturizing affect. After using Hydra Genius for extra dry skin for a little bit over two weeks, the dry patches on my skin went away and my skin feels hydrated throughout the whole day. The cream feels good when applying and it smells very nice and fresh. I just wish there would be more ounces in the jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is heaven sent! I have tried many other products similar to this and did not get great results! I not only feel my skin is hydrated but can also see the difference! Thank you L'Oréal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this lightweight formula. It lasted all day and even in the summer my skin absorbed it right away. It didn't leave me feeling oily at all, just left my skin soft. I love even more that it didn't make my makeup run at all either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am very satisfied with this new product! It became my go-to moisturizer. I enjoy the good smell once i open up the jar and apply it every morning. It moisturizes my skin right away and i feel like i do not need to apply anything else. My skin is eating up the moisture right away and does not leave an oily layer. I can highly recommend HYDRA GENIUS DAILY LIQUID! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was surprised how amazing this product actually was! If you have extremely dry skin like I do, this is the product for You! I have finally found a moisturizer that works. It has a fresh scent and a little product goes a long way. It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. Forever customer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't actually have dry skin. Mostly oily skin, actually. But this moisturizer just made my skin feel soft. Not greasy at all! I use it mostly at night (because I need a moisturizer with sunscreen during the day -otherwise 5/5 stars). I also love to use it after the beach and sun exposure to soothe and soften. I am curious to try some others in the Hydra skincare line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this product made me feel fresh . My skin was so soft it definitely helps with dry skin .lightweight and little goes a long way . I love this product and highly recommend if you have dry skin like me . Will be purchasing once I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I always thought I had oily skin, so I used every product I could to dry my face out. Over time it caught up with me, and I have had so many issues with dry patches that I couldn't get rid of. I have tried different moisturizers, and none have helped to fix the discomfort until this product. A little goes a long way for sure! The scent of it is pleasant, I did not have any strange reactions to it and would recommend to anyone who has very very dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this product for little over a week now and I'm not sure I like it. It smells greats. It definitely hydrates my skin. I can tell the difference in my skin using it. My face is not as dry. But it feels a little too greasy for me. Maybe it would work better for me in the fall/winter time, but with the humid summer days we've had recently, my face definitely feels more greasy. Don't think I will continue to use it for right now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really love how soft my skin feels now. I was really surprised at how lightweight the formula was, and prefer to use it as a day moisturizer. I also think the packaging is cute. I like the square shape of the jar and the soft blue color is really nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'oreal's Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care Extra Dry skin has done wonders for my skin. I have always struggled with finding a product that would hydrate my skin but not feel greasy or too heavy on my skin. This has been a great product. It isn't too heavy where I feel self-conscious. I also don't have to worry about touching things after applying this lotion, since it isn't greasy and won't spread to other things. Definitely recommend this to anyone who has dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love everything about this moisturizer! It smells so fresh and clean. The jar is just too cute! The fact that it comes in my favorite color is a bonus too. This stuff is amazing. It isn't too thick or too thin, it's just right and it totally keeps my face moisturized even if I forget to put it on every day. I will be buying this in the future. I would definitely recommend this to everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this moisturizer! I love the cute little jar that it comes in-just like their masks do. The jar gives it a bit of a 'fancy' touch as while it sits on the counter. The scent is like that of their masks too, just clean and fresh. The moisturizer does it's job, without that greasy feeling that some others leave behind. It blends well into your skin, and wears well under your makeup routine. I have enjoyed using this moisturizer, I think that this would be one that I would repurchase.

"Living in Texas my skin dries out quickly. I tried Hydra Genius for extra hydration and I must say, I was wowed! I first tried it in the evening after washing my face. The next morning it was as if I just put it on. It was not oily at all and it made my face feel smooth and well hydrated. I put it on again in the morning and even in the sun my face remained hydrated. This will certainly be an every day part of my face routine. I don't think it can get better than this.

"Finally- a non-greasy, non-thick moisturizer for very dry skin! I'm impressed. The scent is ok- very slightly off-putting but nothing terrible. I'm excited to see if this makes a strong change in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer made my skin look dewy without making my skin oily. It also didn't irritate my skin which is one of my concerns since I have sensitive skin. My skin felt great for the rest of the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After a few days of trying L'Oréal Hydra genius it made my skin feel refreshed and clean. It's been a while since my skin has felt healthier and I felt beautiful. As of today my skin feels a little bit tighter and clearer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream works very well! The cream was thicker than most day creams but not heavy absorbed completely and worked great for day under my sunscreen and foundation. Unfortunately it wasn't quite as hydrating as my usual night cream (I have a dry skin condition) this is definitely going to be my go to day cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used it on the first day that I received it. My skin was VERY VERY moisturized but, not in an oily way. I want to try it as a night cream now because the weather is getting warmer and I need a mattifying cream because I have a shiny T zone but, for the night time after washing or exfoliating the face...this cream is great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The packaging does not feel cheap. The container is glass with a plastic lid. The scent is light but very pleasant. Does not overwhelm the senses. I washed my face and applied just a pea-sized portion to my face. That was just the right amount to cover my face. It left my face feeling really soft the next day. I am pleased with this moisturizer because it hydrates without making your skin oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Was so excited when I was told I gonna be getting one of the new L'Oréal Hydra Genius Extra Dry Skin Daily Moisturizer products. First off I love the thickness of this product. And when on the skin it has that cooling effects which doesn't just feel amazing but good for hot days. The smell isn't too much and it leaves my skin feeling well....hydrated!!!! I also have some dry patches on my face. So seeing a result in those clearing up back to normal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm pretty pleased with this product! It smells and feels just like the Avon brand I used to buy. It's lightweight and hydrates my skin before applying my foundation every morning. My only concern is how much it actually costs, which I haven't figured out yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a lightweight, luxurious feeling cream that glides on easily. It works great to keep my skin moisturized and as a bonus, it has a really nice fresh scent. A small amount of this cream covers the entire face and neck, which is impressive! . A healthy glow goes a long way to impart youthfulness in spite of the wrinkles. I like this product!

"I think that I was a little dissapointef at first because after the first time I applied it the moisturizer didn't keep my skin hydrated,but after I few days I noticed a huge difference in my skin my skin was originally very dry and flaky, but as long as you keep up with the moisturizer and apply it as instructed you will see a huge difference in your skin.

"When my Hydra Genius arrived i was a little skeptical about how it would work, but after i tried it in the morning and night i am a hundred percent it is a bliss!! I've been having troubles with my skin because of my thyroid problems and from being oily now it's very dry, sometimes even flakey, but now i am starting to feel like my prayers have an answer with this incredible mosturizer from L'oreal. So far my experience is very positive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Recently I have been trying out a bunch of different moisturizers and Hydra Genius knocked all of them out of the park! A little bit definitly goes a LONG way when first using this product. I used it at night right after washing and toning, and my skin was so supple that I didn't have to reapply in the morning! I have sensitive skin and there hasn't been any break outs or irritation. Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product every morning and night since I received the sample in the mail and my skin can't thank me enough! There is such glow to my skin and softness.

"This product is just as advertised....and more! I am usually a bit leery of lotions or creams of any type on my face because of fear of greasy residue and clogging pores and causing unwanted acne. This smells amazing and leaves absolutely NO residue behind! It makes me face feel clean, smooth and super hydrated. Using it at night also tends to help relax my skin from the day's stress and I find that I can even fall asleep much easier! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"First things first, I only used this as a night cream, I didn't use it to moisturize during the day. Even so, I could truly notice a VISIBLE difference in my skin. The formula is so smooth and light, I could barely feel the product itself within seconds of putting it on my skin. Unlike other moisturizers that leave a bit of an oily residue on your skin, this stuff is pretty much untraceable aside from the fact that it REALLY works! I will never ever go back to my old moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

It's really difficult to find good face products due to my sensitive skin. My skin is really dry all the time but recently my skin has been getting softer and my skin is starting to glow i have been using this product for the last week and a half i apply it twice a day and i have to say i am very happy with the results.

This cream is very hydrating and the moisturizing effects lasts for about 72 hours as it says. I didn't have to re-apply again for several days. It also does not feel heavy and greasy after applied unlike other mosturizers I have tried. Pores also appeared to be smaller after use. I would definitely recommend to anyone with dry skin. The scent is relatively mild but a little stronger than I usually prefer which is why I only gave 4 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Upon getting this product I immediately thought the bottle looked very expensive. I could not wait to use it and opened it immediately. The scent is fresh and not too strong. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and really like the way it feels when I apply it. I do not see any lasting effects after 3 weeks but I will continue to use it each night and morning. I will be making it a part of my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think if you have dry skin like i do because of this harsh winter im having up here in idaho you'll love it!

I have struggled for the longest time with my face constantly being very dry and red. I have tried many products that have just made the problem worse. I have even tried simple things like non scented lotion and plain soap to wash and hydrate my face. The first day I tried this product I absolutely fell in love. It instantly took the dryness and redness away and finally made me feel confident again. The scent was also very nice. I highly recommended this product!

I've been using L'Oréal's Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care for extra dry skin for a week now and I'm thoroughly impressed. My skin drinks up the cream and has a smoother texture and appearance. I have excema and my skin gets so itchy during winter. I use L'Oréal's cream twice daily and it provides immediate relief. My only complaint is that it leaves a slightly sticky feeling on my skin. I would recommend this cream to any of my friends and would purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I just tried L'Oreal Hydra Genius and I have found my new moisturizer. The first thing I noticed was that it is not sticky or heavy on my face. Hydra Genius also has the most pleasant aloe scent not a perfumey scent, which I appreciated. I have a problem with oily skin and since using this product the oily feeling hasn't been a problem. That's huge. No Oily Skin. My face has never felt softer, smoother or more hydrated. My skin actually feels healthier after using Hydra Genius. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

She loves it too and her skin looks amazing. One note about the product, however, is to only take a small amount. Maybe about the size of a pea, a lot goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin gets more dry than usual during the winter so it is very hard to keep it looking fresh. This product is simply amazing. My skin feels a million times more fresh and hydrated. I am very picky with lotions because a lot of them make my skin feel cakey or like if i have a mask on. This product does the complete opposite, it feels nice and fresh and smells good but its not too overwhelming. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The smell of the product is very light and smell very good, I love it. It also kept my skin hydrated throughout the day and night after I start using it and not that greasy. It's not as thick as I thought it will be. Will definitely purchase this item for future use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far so good. It is packaged beautifully in a nice glass container. When I opened it and applied it I noticed the smell, it smells wonderful!! Not overpowering just a light fresh scent. Instantly as I applied I felt my skin felt a little softer! So excited to see how it does over the next day or so! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used Hydra Genius Daily Liquid L'Oreal and it re-hydrates skin great! It left my face feeling hydrated, soft and smooth. It takes a little bit to dry but once it does it feels great! I definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although my skin is actually more combination than dry, I get dry patches in the winter. I apply this in the morning and night after cleaning my face. This cream not only has a nice fresh scent, but makes the skin on my cheeks feel super soft and smooth. I would definitely recommend this line to a friend, and probably try the Normal/Dry skin formula in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been very skeptical about switching my routines when it comes to my skin, but I'm so glad I gave L'Oreal another go around. My skin has really felt the difference and my dry patches are almost gone after just a week. It is a tad bit greasy when you first pump it in your hands but within 30 seconds you can feel the cold hydrating sensation kick in and within a minute it is soaked in and your ready to go! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product works great. It smells amazing like a perfume but it doesn't break me out or dry out my skin. It's very moisturizing and doesn't take long to sink into the skin. The lotion really does help with my dry skin which I've struggled with forever. I didn't think it would actually help but I can tell a huge difference in my skin. It feels really smooth and just so much more refreshed [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I suffer from dry cracking skin in the winter months and after first applying the product I immediately noticed how hydrated my skin felt. Most products my skin absorbs right up and im left still feeling like my face is still really dry. I gave it 4 stars just because it is a little bit heavy and leaves my skin slightly oily. Overall though its a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that this product is amazing. It exceeded my expectations indefinitely. It is so smooth and so silky when going on. It also has a wonderful scent to go along with it that keeps your face feeling so refreshed and hydrated. I have super dry skin and this will now be my go to product! The results were almost immediate in appearance! My skin is glowing. Totally recommend this product to anybody suffering with dry skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that the L'Oréal Hydra Genius Extra Dry Skin Daily Liquid Care is superb! I instantly could feel my skin being hydrated and it felt so refreshing. My skin feels so soft after I did it in the morning and at night. My family has a history of dry skin and this is a great product that I will share with them because it works better than any previous products. I also have sentive skin and this is suitable for that. I will get this product again to keep my skin fully hydrated and healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The moment I received this product I was so excited that it claims to repair and hyrdrate dry skin. Right after my skin care routine which is in the morning and before bed I applied this moisturizer and instantly I felt my skin feel and look a lot smoother and a lot more healthier. Usually with the cold winter breeze my face breaks and dries even more, but even just within one use, it has drastically made my skin comfortable and protected.

It's not greasy, didn't cause any breakouts, and most importantly, felt great under makeup. I didn't experience any downsides to this and will definitely keep using again and again.

Luckily, I was given the opportunity to try a free sample of L'OREAL's Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care and....it worked! Its aloe formula successfully nourished my skin without clogging my pores. Plus, it smells amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Will purchase again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the Hydra Genius face lotion for extra dry skin works well for dry skin. I used at night since my skin needs the hydration at night. Now that its summer, I found that the lotion was a bit too heavy for during the day. My face would look really oily during the summer but winter this would work day and night. It felt thick and hydrating when inside put it on. So far so good. My skin seems a lot smoother once I put it which I really liked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have to say I absolutely loved this product! It has a refreshing light clean scent. I loved how a little bit went a long way! My skin didn't feel heavy or tacky.

I'm so glad I finally found one that doesn't ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ok, I was sceptical when I first tried Loreal Hydra Daily Liquid Care for extra dry skin. For over 30 years I had been using another product I thought was working pretty good. WOW! I am glad I got the opportunity to try this new product! It goes on light and moisturizes reducing wrinkles! I definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Hydra Genius liquid care is all that it says it is. Extremely hydrating and refreshing. However there is a layer of moisture which makes the skin sticky . I would like using this cream in winter as I think it will be very hydrating in cold weather. Overall a good product, perfect for the winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I can not stand products that feel heavy and feel like they are clogging up my pores. This was super lightweight on my face. Very moisturizing. The only thing I would say is that I was not a fan of the smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this lotion right after a trip in Maryland where I was on the beach and got sun burn so it was perfect timing. This lotion worked perfectly on my face where it was dried out from the sun the most like my forehead, and near my hair line, as well as my nose. It is super hydrating and smells mild and good as well. I would recommend this as a regular face lotion to people with dry to moderate skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the best face cream yet!!! It goes on smooth and creamy yet it doesn't leave skin wet or greasy feeling/looking. My skin feels instantly hydrated andnot tight and dry. It lasts all day with out feeling dry. My makeup can be applied right afterwards without being smeared or not looking wet and clumpy. I've this stuff!

I think the Hydra Genius for Extra Dry Skin is phenomenal! I have some wacky skin. It's dry in some areas and occasionally oily in others. It leaves my skin nice and smooth.

"I recently tried this moisturizer and I was surprised at how hydrated and and soft my face feels! My face gets pretty dry and is also very sensitive to products. The Hydra Genius seems to do the trick of tackling my dry skin on my forehead and nose, without making me break out! It's smells good too although, I'm not a huge fan of lasting scents on my face because that seems to be all I smell. I will definitely use again...even my husband wants to try it out!

I have extremely dry skin and I have been looking for something to sooth and refresh my skin. During the summer months I spend a lot of time outside in my pool. The chlorine coupled with the sun really takes a toll on my face. My skin ends up feeling uncomfortable and tight because it gets so dry. Using L'Oreal Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care for Extra Dry Skin has saved my skin from dryness and kept it feeling comfortable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried hydra genius daily liquid for extra dry skin. Today was my 3rd day using it. I apply it at night and morning to clean skin, per the directions. After applying it into the skin, I feel as if it doesn't lock in as well as other moisturizers. In fact It almost leaves like a sticky feeling residue. I haven't noticed much difference in my skin in the 3 days of using it. I wouldn't recommend this product, maybe it would work better for someone with super dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The jar of moisturizer was surprisingly heavy, which worried me a bit. I thought it was going to feel too heavy on my skin like a layer of sunscreen. I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the jar and applied the moisturizer. It was light and airy and instantly soaked into my dry skin. My skin felt hydrated all day, without that thick goopy feeling. Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this skin cream. It is great for really dry skin. It goes on smooth and is really hydrating. I like the scent too.

"I honsetly love this product! Cute packaging is a plus, but this formula is not greasy and does a great job! Love the mild fragrance, it's perfect for my dry sensitive skin.

"L'Oréal Paris Hydra Genius Daily Liquid care for extra dry skin is absolutely amazing! My skin feel so refreshed after using this product. I've been using it every day for about a week and I can already notice a difference in the texture of my skin. My face has a natural glow after using this moisturizer. Also, it is lightweight so my face doesn't feel way down after using this moisturizer . I plan on buying this moisturizer in the future and look forward to finishing this product.

"I have sensitive/combination skin, but the dry spots can get severely dry at times. Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care Extra Dry Skin is the best lotion I have tried so far. I was not even allergic to the scent, which is pretty rare for me. After three days of using this lotion, my skin has changed considerably. It looks and feels softer, bouncier and less dry and irritated. My eyebags have even been looking less droopy. 10/10 would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loreal's hydra genius extra dry skin is awesome! It absorbs super fast, and doesn't leave a sticky or filmy residue, so it works great under my foundation. It keeps my skin soft and hydrated for hours yet is lightweight. It had a nice clean scent that is pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Hydra Genius for Extra Dry Skin is absolutely amazing! This cream is thick and luscious, and once it's absorbed leaves your skin feeling light and dewy all day or night. I like to use it after my night time skin routine for moisturized and glowing skin in the morning. Hint: you can also use it on dry and cracked elbows for baby-soft skin the next morning. The fragrance is a little strong but fades quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I honestly love this stuff! it leaves your skin super soft, and feels like it works right away.

A little goes a long way and it got rid of the dry flakes on my face especially by my nose and eyebrows. I definitely recommend trying this if you suffer from super dry skin like me.

Lately I've had extra dry skin to the point where no lotion or any type of moisturizer seems to be working. When I got this I used it that same night and it begins working instantly!

"I am a skincare junkie, and I have very dehydrated skin with some flakiness in some areas and as soon as I applied this product it instantly smoothed out and hydrated my dry skin areas. My skin was instantly silky smooth and in the morning my skin felt like baby skin. This also is the best smelling skin care I have tried. Overall I absolutely recommend this.

"So far I think this product is really great! I have super dry skin after cleansing because of acne medications and then super oily skin during the day. Therefore, it's really hard to find moisturizers that can help with dryness without causing acne. This product is thicker than what I am used to using and more effective. My only complaint is that there is added fragrance. My skin can be unpredictable and sensitive, so for me the added chemicals are unnecessary and could be harmful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very satisfied with this product! It has a clean smell unlike most facial moisturizer. It even works well under face makeup. I know the product says it's for your face but I couldn't help but use it all over my body as well. :) I'm pregnant and it actually moisturizers better than the belly butter I was currently using !

"I was pleasantly surprised at this face cream. I was expecting it to be oily, but my skin sucked it right up. There was no residue at all. It helped out so much after being in the sun (even with sunscreen) and my nose got flaky. My skin looks much more radiant, and no more peeling! My only issue with it is that the fragrance is pretty strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm loving this Hydra Genius moisturizer! It's a medium weight but without the greasy feeling when you touch. It promises to last 72 hours and it really does! I have extra dry, flaky, scaly skin and this is the best moisturizer I've tried yet. It doesn't make my acne flare up like other lotions either. It smells great too!

"This lotion went on very light and works all day, I do wish that it had spf because I've been trying to find a daily face lotion with spf that won't make my face look oily and that works well under my makeup like this product did.

"I really liked that this moisturizer felt really lightweight and not heavy especially with it being summer. I could feel a difference in my skin over a few days.

"I think Lireal Hydra Genius Extra Dry Skin worked great on my sensitive skin. I used it as part of my daily morning and night cleanse then moisturize routine and by the third day I could tell a difference in my skin because it wasn't flaky throughout as it normally would be. It went on smooth and not sticky, felt more like satin when applied. I feel like it has made a good difference in my skin's hydration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It is a very rich cream that is hydrating and refreshes skin. I tried the Hydra Genius Daily Liquid care for extra dry skin. It went on nicely and refreshed my skin with a subtle scent. The only problem I faced was that my skin felt a little oily but I think it was due to the heat. It was great as a night cream as well! Overall it was a great product and great quantity for the price. Highly recommended of your skin needs some extra moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have very dry skin and it doesn't help that I live in the desert either. My skin needs extra moisturizer and most products can't deliver for me. This product, however, absolutely does!! You only need the smallest amount but it really hydrates the skin. The smell is great too, not overpowering at all! I use this in the morning and my skin is still baby soft at night.

"I've struggled with super dry skin for as long as I can remember and, after trying (and failing) with most moisturizers, this one has finally hit the mark. It keeps me hydrated all day long without causing my skin to get oily (ick!) or break out in loads of pimples (double ick)! Will definitely be keeping this in my beauty regime for a very long time.

From the wonderful smell to the first use I knew I was going to love this moisturizer. The smell is just wonderful and the way it leaves my skin feeling is amazing. This moisturizer soaks right into your skin with no greasy feeling and keeps your face feeling beautiful all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I work outside for a living and this is great after a really long hot drying day in the sun. However I think it was way too heavy to use twice daily as recommended and even still a bit too heavy to use daily. While I typically like a perfumed lotion for the body, this was way too scented to be on the face, the scent was nice, and very clean, just a but too strong for my taste.

"Best hydrating skin product I have ever used! It's very silly and light like a serum and I love the way it feels when I rub it on my face, very refreshing. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any sticky or heavy feeling of product. I also love that it doesn't take very much so one jar will go a long ways. I apply every morning and night as the directions say and could feel a change in the smoothness of my skin in only a few days! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that this cream is one of the best one that I've tried. I like the aperance of the product itself. The cram has good fresh smell. The cream is smooth consistency. Most of all the cream does what it say. It keeps my dry sin hydrated for 72 hours. Received many compliments at work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is an excellent product!!! It actually does what it's meant to do. I have tried a lot of other moisturizers from Target, Sephora, etc. I think it works better than ALL the other products. The price range is excellent and very affordable for a lot of people. Don't waste your money on expensive brands. Try this first!!!! You have nothing to lose. I'll definitely continue using this product in my daily skin care routine [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think L'OReal has hit on a product I can agree with. It seems to be the best I have tried for moisturizing my skin. My face feels real soft and smooth without feeling greasy as some can leave me feeling. I very highly recommend anyone to at least try it and see for yourself. I really like the fact that for what the product does it is very reasonably priced compared to other products of it's kind. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This Moisturizer is fantastic!First off it smells Wonderful almost like a high-end perfume so that's a great plus and then it went on so smooth now it did feel a little sticky after I applied it but not so much that it would bother you and so far really has hydrated my skin.My face is a lot smoother and seriously not dry at all.So I will be buying this cream when I run out so if you want a Great moisturizer try Loreal Hydra Genius,Seriously it's that good you wont be sorry.

Over the last week I have switched from my normal daily moisturizer to loreals hydragenius and I have to say that I love it! It is a lightweight gel that is so refreshing and gentle on my sensitive skin and doesn't irritate it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oréal Paris Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care moisturizer is great! It doesnt leave your face feeling greasy. My face is sensitive and this didn't make me break out and I love the light fresh scent. Definitely recommend this product to friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't have dry skin. I would consider my skin normal, but I live in the desert and I need a good moisturizer. I like the way this cream makes my skin feel, though I feel that once it dries it has a ""grainy"" like feel to it. I think this cream would be too thick under my makeup, but I'll continue to use it before bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is amazing it will be one I continue to use. I have extremely dry skin that usually gets flaky and itchy but since I started using this my skin hasn't flaked at all, it's not itchy and it doesn't have that tight feeling a lot of other moisturizers leave. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleasantly suprised by the way it felt and smelled. I was excepting a think lotion type feel and it's more like a watery gel. It goes on smooth and dried up the oily spots on my face but left the dry spots soft and moisturized. It didn't dry my face up or add to the oilyness it's actually helped it all go away. The light scent it carries was a huge suprise as well but it's not overbearing . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Overall this product seems like a good moisturizer. I have extremely dry skin and often still have dry skin flakes all over my face after I use my normal moisturizer. This moisturizer left me with no dry flakes but it seemwas d to make my face get oily sooner throughout the day. A little goes a long way so I could see this jar lasting me for months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think it's one of the best moisturizers I've tried so far. I love the clean smell. It feels light and refreshing on my skin. My skin was moisturized for the whole day & became so soft after a few days. I would definitely buy this in the future. I think it's great especially for winter season to lock in that moisture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Normally in the summer I have to moisturize multiple times a day. With Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care Extra Dry Skin I only moisturize in the morning and at night. When applying you can feel the soothing effects of aloe. It leaves my skins so soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin can get oily, but this moisturizer not only made my skin feel soft but didn't leave an oily residue behind. I also get acne pretty bad and this product didn't break me out or make my breakouts worse. I've tried other products like this and they usually either make my skin more oily or don't make it soft, but this moisturizer did everything I wanted and more. I would absolutely get more.

"I have sensitive skin and have found heavy creams make me break out This cream, even though it's for extra dry skin, has a light texture and didn't cause break outs. It feels great on and has a very soft scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this produce for 2 weeks and the only bad thing I can say is that it has a very strong smell. I am very sensitive to purfumey smells and this has exactly that. The 1st night I almost scrubbed it off but I thought no I'd better give it a good chance. Because of the smell I will not be using the product again in the future. Aside from that I was very satisfied. Skin feel smooth and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was a little skeptical to use the Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care because most moisturizers leave my face feeling cakey due to the high humidity where I live. But this goes on super light and I still feel really clean. I'm really happy I've found something I can use daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved how this product got rid of my dry skin. The only issue I saw was that it's a bit oily for me at first and then after a while it was fine. I noticed that it was quite thick and left a film on my face so when it was humid i had a lot of sweat that would pool on my face, but that happens normally but it was just different because you have to pat off the sweat instead of wiping it because you didn't want to wipe the product off.

"I don't necessarily have extra dry skin, but I live in the desert. So during the summer months when the temperate climbs to 105-115 degrees I always increase my moisturizer to protect my skin. Living in the desert daily use is a must. I really like the clean scent of the L'Oréal Paris Hydra Genius Daily Liquid Care. I love that it is made with Aloe. *Every morning when I try to get ready this little guy wants my attention.* [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Initially I was hesitant on trying out this product but because I have extra dry skin and it's bothersome I decided to give it a shot. I started off with my hands and I've seen some improvement, they are less dry and I feel more confident. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. I didn't realize how much I needed it. I have been struggling with red patches on my face for years. After using this cream nightly, my patches are less pronounced, and my face looks more radiant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I usually have really dry skin. This stuff is amazong! After you put it on, your skin just absorbs it. It makes my skin feel so soft and i motice a change in it. It leaves a little bit of a sticky feeling, but thats because of the glycerin in it, which is also good for helping your makeup stay on. It makes my skin look great with makeup too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this moisturizer is awesome! It really helps any and all dry spots. I even put it on my ankles! And this healed them. Its very light weight and absorbs quick into your skin. It has a very light clean scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love this product. I have dry skin and sensitive to some products. I was a little nervous about trying this but I was very satisfied with it. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars was the smell. I didn't really like the smell of the cream. My face feels soft and doesn't look dry like it was before using it. I've used lots of different products and this is by far one I'd the best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I thought it had a fresh smell. It absorbed into my skin fairly quickly if I used a small bit which I loved because it acted as a great base for makeup!! At night I added a little bit more and my skin looked great the next morning -- like I remembered to drink all eight of my daily glasses of water. Because we all remember to do that always, right?

I have been using this product for over a week now and I already see amazing results. I use it every morning and night after washing my face. It smells amazing and feels great on the skin. It feels cool and light when put on and locks in moisture all day. All around great product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
this lotion smells amazing! it has a creamy lightweight texture and left my skin smooth and supple for hours. i wouldn't use it on the face though as the scent may irritate sensitive skin due to the fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think it's amazing! I have been using another brand of moisturizer and it has made my face so oily! I have tried many and they either make it worse or oily. This feels like I didn't even put anything on! No shiny face that I need to blot! Or adding more cause it's so dry! I have used this twice a day for 6 days and love it!! Can't wait to try the whole line [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is amazing. I love that it really moisturizes my skin intensely. My skin feels super smooth the morning after I apply this. I have been using this as a night cream for the last few nights and my skin feels great. This product does not have a smell at all, it is a very thick/heavy cream (which I love). I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with dry skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had a terrible sunburn from a long weekend outdoors and I tried everything to relive that dry itchy feeling. Once I tried this product I felt instant relief! It kept those very burnt areas nice and moisturized and helped me to not peel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is EVERYTHING!! I have dry skin and this moisturizer keeps my skin looking moisturized ALL day. I'm really into skin care and it's been hard to find moisturizers that work all day, but this one does it for me! I highly recommend it to anyone that has dry skin. Especially if you wear makeup!! I know using powders on your face can really dry it out, but it kept me looking moisturized all the time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

The product smells and feels great. It went on very smooth but my face looks and feels greasy. It is summer and it's humid out so my face isn't as dry as normal. I suspect this product would be great for my winter skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this was terrific. Basic, but works. It did not blow me off my feet, but it did its job. The smell is fresh but not overpowering whatsoever. I have extremely dry skin so this locked right in to my night time face washing routine. Very soft and not a ""cakey lotion. I will continue using it until it's gone.

My face is a bit dry so when i got the cream for extra dry skin I was so excited. After each use i have seen a significance in the appearance of my skin. My skin feels smooth and not dry nor oily whatsoever. My t zone is where I have the most problem i did see a change. I can't wait to keep using it to see even better results. It does not have a strong smell which is a plus. Over all great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is great. It left my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I struggle with dry skin really bad but this has really helped. It doesn't leave a oily feeling on my skin. it soaks in nicely.

"I can't get enough of this. I loved how it felt like silk on my skin and it didn't have any oily feel. I also liked how my skin still felt like it could breath when I put this on . I have very sensitive skin and it's hard to find products for my skin but this is my new go-to . Even though it had a slight scent , it was just enough to make my skin feel and smell good but not make it break out....It has a home in my makeup bag!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I saw immediate results when I used this. Although I have combination skin this worked wonders on my skin. I found it best to apply it right before I go to sleep so that when I wake up I have nice plump skin. I love that there is barely any scent to it which I know a lot of people will like about. When I first used I wished I got a bigger jar but after using it for 3 weeks I found that using a little bit goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product smells very good. When you initially put it on, your skin starts to feel cool and refreshed. One con is that I feel that the lotion is too thin for my dry skin,so I mix it with other lotions to thicken it up. Otherwise, this product works perfectly fine, but only for your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream has a light scent that is very nice. It feels like a lotion but works as well as a cream and a little goes a long way. It left my skin feeling moisturized but not overly oily. During colder days my skin usually gets very dry but this cream has kept my face protected. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I think it be a great product to try for dry skin! It has great plant extracts in it! Smells great and refreshing! It lasts through the night and into the morning at least did for me!

"This moisturizer is a great simple cream that does it's job well. It's a little thicker that I was expecting but it absorbs easily into my (very dry) skin, and I haven't felt dry at the end of the day like I do with some others. I also really like that it has no smell. A good size jar for the price, too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was a great moisturizer for my extremely dry and sensitive skin, but it was still great as a day cream because it absorbs completely. It was gentle on my sensitive Rosaca prone skin. It does however, have a definite scent. Its not a bad smell but could be an irritant if you are sensitive to smells. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has worked wonderfully for me so far! My biggest fear was that it would break me out, but it definitely hasn't. That's huge in my book! I tend to have sensitive skin but this has been great. I would definitely purchase this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not love this product, it caused breakout on my face. Gave it to my Mum. My sister tried it and it also cause breakouts. I was really looking forward to using it. However, was disappointed. For one thing, the scent too strong. And the cream was on the thicker side. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very excited to try this product as the skin on my face has been so dry as the weather has turned cold and we are in the depths of winter. I applied this to my face in the evening after cleansing and it made my face burn within moments of applying. It got worse and made my face red. Because of the pain it caused, I only applied it that once and have been scared to use it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product! I have severely dry skin as well as eczema,especially in winter! My face gets really itchy, red, and visibly dry. I've tried many washes, creams, and lotions. I apply this cream at night and in the morning after washing. Instantly, I felt a relief from itchiness and dryness. After a couple of days the redness was gone and skin was visibly softer. So simple, and super effective, great product! Definitely a must try, if not a must have! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have pretty sensitive skin and tend to break out easy when I try new products, so I was skeptical of putting this on my face. I did and I didn't break out and my face finally felt quenched. I usually in the winter have to put lotion on my face a couple times a day to stop flaking, but my face hasn't felt dry at all since I have put this on once a day. It's a thick lotion so a little goes a long way; this container will last me a long time. There is a fragrance, but it's pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I think it is amazing for really dry skin. It soaks in quickly and doesn't leave a thick residue like some others do. Although I would not recommend using it during the day as far as morning time due to it being a thicker product and personally I just don't like that thick of a product in the morning before I do my makeup and other skin care routines.

I really like this product. It goes on smoothly and dries quickly into the skin. It is not oily at all. It is a lovely whipped cream. And it smells divine!

"I've only been using this since it arrived on Thursday, but I kind of love it! My skin is crazy dry in the winter, and this makes it feel so much better. It smells great and isn't too heavy feeling. The only problem I ran into is my skin breaking out a bit more. I don't think it's used to that much moisturizer. It's not a bad breakout, so all the pros definitely outweigh the cons!

I think the L'Oréal hydra genius daily liquid care for extra dry skin is an excellent product for people who have dry skin especially at winter time when it affects most . I used it in the morning and at night time and I immediately saw a change in my skin appearance. It looked smoother and more healthy. Now my makeup looks more flawless due to my skins texture being more moisturizer. This has definitely become a staple in my beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I read a positive review about this product, and on the box it says that it is suitable for sensitive skin, but the fragrance is really strong, almost overpowering. Why would a product that is going on a person's face have such an overpowering smell? I've only had the product for two days so I don't know if it will help my dry skin."
"I think that this product is great, it has helped my skin a lot! All of my dry areas on my face have now turned into nice silky skin! It only takes a couple of small squirts for your face and the bottle will last every bit of 4-6 months even with daily morning and nighttime use! I give this product 5 stars it has exceeded my expectations! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for a week now and I've notice my skin become extremely smoother. When using hydra genius you can literally feel your face absorbing the product. It also smells great and I absolutely love the way it makes my face feel right after! I'd highly recommend this to my friends!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been trying to take better care of my skin now that I'm getting a little older and am becoming more strict about using moisturizer at least once a day. This moisturizer is really nice. Love the lightweight feel, how quickly it absorbed and the fragrance is nice too. I have fairly sensitive skin and this product had no irritating affect on my face. Lastly I like the quantity of the product - a nice large bottle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love it!! Feels wonderful on my face. Help my face its no longer dry. It doesn't leave my face feeling oilly. Very easy to put on and drys fast. You don't need a lot a little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have dry, sensitive skin, it's hard to find products that work for the day without irritations the sensitive. This moisturizer is great. Light weight, my skin seems to drink it up. I've only used it twice so I don't have a long term usage to review. Only downside is the smell. It smells like men's cologne and the scent lingered for a while. Try it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm always trying to find a great product to help with the dry skin on my face. I decided to give L'Oréal a try and it was worth it! My face and skin has never felt more hydrated and glowing! I apply it every morning as part of my morning facial routine and it keeps me hydrated and glowing all day long. I have had people who are close to me even ask me what's different with my skin and when I told them they instantly confirmed how great my skin looked and felt!

"I really really love this moisturizer! The product goes on really nicely and left my skin smooth. I also love the fresh-like effect! Also, I really liked the scent of this product. It didn't smell like an average, boring moisturizer which I really liked and I also liked the clean packaging! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this moisturizer! This actually smells really nice which is always a plus. It instantly softened my hands which I've never had a product do. I may have gotten a little out of hand and used it everywhere. Which led to a weird layered feeling on my skin. Overall I 100 percent recommend this product.
