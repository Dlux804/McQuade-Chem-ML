I like the way it absorbs into my skin and that it has the retinol that protects my skin even lighten my dark spot spots just the overall results are great at a reasonable price I love that it is in a pump
and appears to be event Sr product I like the way it smells or endured doesn't smell it feels great on the skin excetera but we all know that it's a daily process because you can't afford plastic surgery but it seems to work great for what it is meant for
"Very light, non greasy. Processionals is on target for my budget lovely product. Will be reordering when needed. Thanks for such a great priced product line."
I am really enjoying this. Only used 2 times so far. Not sticky and spreads well. Dime size amount works for whole face and neck
"Love, love love these skin products. Excellent results @ great price."
Used it twice only and can already tell a difference.
"I love that it is not tested on animals and is vegan. That is very important to me. So far, it seems to work well, my face isn't as dry in the morning after applying it before bed."
"I was disappointed to see glycerin as the last ingredient. How can it be absorbed into the skin? If the complete list of ingredients had been listed, I probably wouldn't have purchased it. I had a night cream from ToL. Glycerin was the 3rd ingredient. I trusted all products were the same. I'll have to try it."
"I love this Moisturizer. However, on my third day of use the pump quit working. I removed the cap but cannot get the Moisturizer out of the bottle. I am very disappointed."
"I bought this by mistake,i was supposed to buy matrixyl 3000,i heard that one's better,the retinol is not as moisturizing as i expect it to be"
This is a very nice moisturizer that feels light not heavy on your skin.
I could tell it went into my skin immediately and moisturized it without any greasy feel. My skin actually looks better after just a few days!
"I have only used this once, but it felt good on my face and went on easily. It kept my face moist through the night and I like it."
I love the ease of applying it and the way it makes my skin feel!
