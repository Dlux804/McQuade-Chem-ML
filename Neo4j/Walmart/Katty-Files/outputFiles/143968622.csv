This creme lasts all day and is particularly good around the eye area. I would be thrilled if Sam's Club sold more Clinique products!
This is the best cream I have bought for dry skin ever and I have spend lots of money on other products that don't work. My face is hydrated and more toned and best of all I've gotten lots of compliments of how Young I look. I highly recommend it.
Living in Colorado you skin can dry out. This helps my skin so much and feels good on my face. I use it in the mornings then I put on my moisturizer later.
"Love this product and how it makes my skin feel. Clean, hydrated and all day wear. The only thing that goes on my face and at this price, I can continue for years to come."
Great moisturizer.
I've used Clinique products for 30+ years. This is the best moisturizer I've ever used. It's a must have if you experience dry skin like myself.
I am so happy I was able to purchase this Clinique Hydrator. My face has never been this soft and moist..loving it !!!
This is THE BEST moisturizer EVER! It's not greasy. Soakes into your skin quickly. I put in on before my makeup & it helps my makeup last!!!! I'm 60 & LOVE this!!!
"This product is so good for your face. Especially when you've been out in the sun for a day or your face feel dry., just put a little bit on, it light weight, not sticky and face feel hydrated again ."
"To use this you should be over 70 yrs. old and live in a dry desert state. otherwise I would expect you to get the first moisture surge, not the intense. I fit the first statement, so it works for me."
I bought this last month and once it came in realized I bought the wrong one. It works just as well with the exception of being a little heavier because it is a cream. I use it and like it very much.
I have dry skin and this moisture cream really helps my skin! I use it at night and under my makeup.
This is a good moisturizer my daughter has sensitive skin and can use this moisturizer without having any reaction.
First time user. Very hydrating but not oily.
"Been using Clinique for years, love the way my skin looks."
great Product at a great price
"I have really severely parched dry skin and live in very cold Maine and this works great! Well, even in the summer my skin is dry and I love this. I've even tried layering other moisturizers and putting a skin oil serum on top if I've run out of this, and just nothing works as well as this. Love it! Would love to see Sams offer more Clinique items, been using them for years, and our local Macy's has closed."
So happy I bought this!!
Great skincare product!
