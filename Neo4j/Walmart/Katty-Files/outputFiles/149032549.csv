"I used this in the evenings, and used the Daily Hydrating Lotion in the mornings, in conjunction with the daily foaming cleanser. It seemed like the regimen worked reasonably well, as my skin seemed fairly hydrated. I have acne prone skin, and this did not worsen it or make me break out. It was thick in consistency, as I expect a night cream to be. It felt quite moisturizing, but didn't feel greasy or oily on my skin at all. It absorbed quickly into the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I am already noticing a huge improvement in my skin tone and texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Iâve been using this for about a month now at night and im not use i see any difference. It is moisturizing and a thinner consistency then the regular lotion. But does it work for wrinkles? I doubt it. But my face does feel more hydrated in the morning
"I have been using the night moisturizer for two weeks and am very happy with it. It feels very silky, applies smoothly, and provides a rich moisture. I use Retin A and I apply the night moisturizer on top of it and it stopped the dryness that Retin A can cause. My skin feels and looks great. Very happy that I purchased this product and love the results."
Finally a night cream for extra dry skin. I have been looking for this type of cream for the longest time. Im going on my second now. Let me say I'm relieved!

I also use the cetaphil body lotion, make up remover , facial cream with SPF for sunny etc. I highly recommended"

I have been using cetaphil night cream for almost a month. The night cream is non fragrant and not greasy. I have combination skin type. I did not break out using this night cream. It did not irritate my face and neck. The night cream is pretty light for a night cream. You do not need to use much to cover your face and neck. I think this would be great for spring/summer time for a night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have to be picky about my night creams since i have combination skin. I do not want to break out while i am sleeping because of an oily night cream. This is not the case with this product.

This stuff works! Now that the cold weather hit I was again seeing dry skin no matter how much moisturizer I put on my face. I starting using this night cream and I wake up with much softer skin. It's all I need to keep moisturized for 24 hours. The smell is light and pleasant - so it's nice to put on right before going to bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am really excited about this lotion. I like the normal Cetaphil lotion but sometimes, especially in the winter, I need more moisture. This seems to be just the thing. Ive used it a couple times and so far think it is great [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how this night cream goes on my face. It is rich and creamy but doesn't feel heavy. I apply to my face and neck and my skin has never felt better. I'm using the entire system of facial care from Cetaphil and honestly this is the first time in years that I actually feel great about my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the night cream. I've been using it almost every night. My face feels so supple in the morning. I'm not really sure what the hyaluronic acid does but I'm glad it is there. I receommend using it every night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using the Cetaphil foaming cleanser, I use just a small amount of this night cream. I sort of just pat it into my skin instead of rubbing. It gives just enough moisture to make my skin feel perfect, but not oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Tried this ceam since it came from my trusted Cetaphil brand, but am surprised as to how soft and nourishing it felt on the skin and at the same time strengthening hydrating as well. Paired it with hydrating eye gel cream and the effect was even better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This night cream is one of my all time favorite creams. My age is catching up to me and I have never really been one to use creams due to my face drying out more or having a reaction to the product. Cetaphil is the only brand of product I have found that does not give me an allergic reaction to and has been very affective on my skin. This brand is a must have in my house.

I love this night cream its the best night ceeam i have ever used. I apply this on my face in the evening before bedtime after cleansing my faxce it nourishes my skin and makes it feel so soft when i wake up in the morning [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I never used to use night cream, only day moisturizer, but I've been using this at night due to the cold, dry weather and it works good. My skin feel moaturized and no greasy. I love all cetaphil products and this is no exception [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I believe that hyaluronic acid is incredibly moisturizing. It is more of a moisturizer than an actual acid. It's non-irritating and proven gentle for sensitive skin. I would recommend everyone to use this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Very creamy and moisturizing without the heavy feeling. Nothing in it to irritate your skin or eyes. Love that it has alpha-Hydroxy in it too. I have really dry skin and this makes my skin just so dewy and moist. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I let my mom try this product at so far it's great leaves her face feeling wonderful in the morning. And by judging by the size of the product it will last an long time . Definitely will recommend to family and friends [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought this a week ago and I really glad I did because it's a great night cream that doesn't make your skin feel great at all and it stays on throughout the night.i really like this product and I will buy this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought this product with a few others, namely the Cetaphil cleanser. I love both. This product is lightweight. I use only a small amount on the tips of my fingers each night after washing my face with their cleanser. It doesn't make my face oily (it already is a bit before washing), and it seems to keep my skin softer. I have never had a night cream that is so light and effective. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"doesn't make me look younger but sure makes my face feel soft! helps remove the dry skin, too."
"I like the feel of this cream better than more expensive ones I have tried. Also, there is no irritation like some of the others. Nice...."
Great I love it very smooth and makes my face feel great
Great product. I wish i found this product sooner.
I love this! Simple does what it says without irritating my skin or stinging when next to eyes! And it doesn't break me out either!
Fantastic. Nothing has cleared up my dry face as good as this.
So this product is okay works decent not wonderful and makes my skin feel super oily which is not great but one problem is it is only half way filled if that. I know it lists the weight but most people assume by size that it is full or mostly full I was dissipointed at how little product come in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love this product. So glad I took the chance and bought it.
Wow went and got this thinking it was another. Moisturizer love this one my skin is soo dry
This cream is PERFECT! Please never discontinue it!
This is a quality product and I am glad to see that Walmart has it at such a good price!
"Very light, non-greasey and good for skin absorbtion."
"Gentle, does not clog pores and makes my skin so soft!"
"This feels like an expensive product, but isn't. I love it. Very moisturizing but not gummy. I will buy it again."
"A little goes a long way. Rich but not greasy. This is comparable to more expensive night creme. 1.7 oz, make it 2 oz for 5 stars."
"I am 70 years old, I love this cream. It keeps my face young looking."
Clears up my dry skin overnight! I also use it in the daytime!
A very nice creamy night cream with beneficial ingredients which my skin seems to appreciate. Just started using it so realistically it is too soon to evaluate.
"Excellent face cream, rich but not greasy in the least. Cures my super dry skin, not sticky, not greasy."
It makes my skin feel soft and it is fragrance free!!!
