"The oil-free moisture SPF 35 gives all day protection to my face. The product is great, but the packaging sent in the US mail was poor. I ordered 3 boxes and one box was ripped open and the outside of the entire package of 3 was smashed."
"I cannot afford the expensive quality SPF face creams, but this one by Neutrogena is gentle on my sensitive skin, has a light fragrance similar to suntan lotion and does a fantastic job of protecting my skin. It goes on light and is not greasy. I have rosacea, and have never had a bad reaction to this lotion."
Great moisturizer! I have normal/combination skin.
"Please, Please, Please -- Never discontinue or reformulate this beyond amazing and perfect moisturiser. I wish you would bring back the Light Night Cream. It was the best in the world. Absolutely the best formulations. Truly what moisturizers are supposed to be. The most high-end brands are nowhere as good as these two products."
"Quick, reliable delivery at down right cheap prices. Didn't have to waste my gas. Love Jet's service stamina [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This lotion is marketed as hypo-allergenic, but includes well-known allergen methylisothiazolinone. I went through two years of awful rashes, multiple appointments, and finally a week-long complicated contact dermatitis patch testing to find out that this ""hypoallergenic"" product was at the root of my issue. Would not trust any Neutrogena product after this. The chemical is only recommended in limited quantities for wash-off products, and even my dermatologist was shocked to discover it was in this product."
I bought this a month ago and after using it for a couple days I realized my face and neck had became red and itchy. It caused me to have a very bad break out so I discontinued use and the redness and itchiness went away but ofcourse I was left with dark marks from the multiple pimples they caused
This product made my face burn the first few times I used it. I continued to use it thinking it would surpass but I used it before going to the beach and the burning was unbearable. My face burned so bad it felt like I had been stung by a bunch of bees. Will never use this product again.
"I bought this two weeks ago and this product gave me a horrible break out. It caused little white heads to come out around my lips and chin area and gave me a rash in my neck. My face was on fire. I've used many many neutrogena products before and we're pleased with the results BUT this one.. this is a no no! As soon as I eliminated this product out of my routine, I no longer had a rash and irritation."
My skin was smooth with little hyperpigmentation and one week of using this I started to get hormonal acne bumps which I stopped using this products to avoid a massive breakout. Hopefully my skin gets smooth like it used to because as of right now my skin is bumpy and it feels like sandpaper. This causes hormonal acne due to the active products
"I bought this moisturizer for my husband, who occasionally has dry skin (esp. in winter). He used it for two days and his face started breaking out in a red rash. He discontinued use right away, and washed the moisturizer away with a mild cleanser (one he typically uses) but it took 2-3 more days for the red rash to go away. I always use Neutrogena for my skin care needs and was disappointed with his experience."
"WOW! First use yesterday and my skin is beet red, swollen, with a painful itch. I took a pic of myself to document it, wish I could share it (although you'd be horrified). I am still 24 hours later with the painful burn, just awful and slight redness. Was told to take benadryl and use a hydrocortisone cream, might take a few days for it to calm down. Might want to look into the formulation of this product since others as well have headed down the same path."
"Is this product non-comedogenic? It doesn't list it under the product details, only hypoallergenic and fragrance-free. All other non-comedogenic products, like the SPF 15 version list “non comedogenic”."
I have been using this product it for a week now and wondering if it is breaking out my skin.
"I have been using this daily moisturizer every day for 3+ years. The consistency is great, the bottle lasts a while, and I have very sensitive skin and have never had any reaction. My only wish is that they made an SPF 50+ with the same consistency, but the higher SPF likely makes that an issue. I would highly recommend."
"I bought this because my dermo recommended a facial moisturizer with SPF30 in it (he didnt recommend neutrogena specifically) after a couple weeks of using this product, I developed an incredibly painful rash on my neck and temple areas of my face. Although im sure this product is fine for many, if you have sensitive skin I would avoid at all costs!"
"I absolutely love Neutrogena products. However, this one is not for me. It's a great, inexpensive SPF product, but it feels greasy on my skin when I go outside. I normally have oily skin and this product pretty much makes it worse. I need to find another SPF product that doesn't feel so greasy/oily on me."
"I have very sensitive, easily irritated, combination skin that is prone to breakouts. I have tried so many spf products & this is the only product that does not irritate my face. Also happy that it has no oil & is fragrance free. I would love to give it 5 stars but I couldn't. I wish this had antioxidants in it. Otherwise, I am pleased that I can use this with no problem..."
I have dry skin and spend a lot of time outdoors so slathering a moisturizer with SPF every morning is a MUST. I used the Complete Acne Therapy system as a teenager and was addicted to the moisturizer that it came with so I searched for a while for a replacement now that I don't use acne products. I think this moisturizer is a great replacement and it lasts a really long time!
"I've been using this product for a long time and haven't had any troubles, or sunburns! In a moisturizer, I just want something that works and lets me not think about it. Absorbs quickly, not greasy, no fragrances, min SPF 30. This one fits the bill, and I like the minimalistic packaging. It's not really special, it just does what its supposed to. So...thanks."
"i loved this product from the moment i first tried it. it glides on my skin and is quickly absorbed. there is no greasy feeling afterwards. it protects my skin against UVA/UVB rays. make-up goes on easily afterwards - no clumping or creasing. and i really like the smell! (smells like suntan lotion, but it's a gentle smell, not overpowering)"
"I thought using a moisturizer combined with SPF 35 would be ideal for my winter vacation in the sun. After using this product for 3 weeks, the skin on my forehead feels dry and leathery, and I have a large burned area on my neck. I should have realized sooner that it was this product that was causing my problems, but I have such faith in the Neutrogena name!! I have stopped using this product & I hope my skin will start to heal."
"This product is excellent. I have sensitive, semi-pale skin, and it is difficult to find a daily facial moisturizer with SPF 30 or greater that goes on smoothly without any white residue. I've been using this product for over two weeks now and it is great. Goes on smoothly, leaves skin feeling soft, absorbs into skin with no white residue, doesn't sweat into eyes like other moisturizers with sunscreen, and doesn't make my sensitive skin break out. EXCELLENT PRODUCT!!!"
"I bought this after being told by my dermatologist to invest in an oil free SPF moisturizer. I was disappointed with this product. I used my doctor prescribed acne gel and this and I still got horrible breakouts. Literally, as soon as I stopped using this, the acne was gone. I have very oily skin and I think that this product was just a bit too oily for my skin type."
"I have combo skin that is very sensitive and breaks out when irritated. This is a genius moisturizer, really hydrating for the dry areas but not making the t-zone at all greasy. The texture is thick but not overly so and I'm able to use one pump to cover my entire face so it's a great value for the money. My skin has not reacted at all and I'm very pleased to have finally found an SPF moisturizer that really protects my skin without wrecking it."
"I bought this about a week ago. Every time I apply, parts of my face get this tingly, slightly irritated sensation that's slowly been increasing. When I saw all the other reviews about skin rashes, it all made sense. Will stop using, unfortunately I don't think I can get a refund."
"I use only Neutrogena products, specifically ultra gentle soothing lotion spf 15. As I spend winters in Florida, I thought oil free moisture with broad spectrum spf 35 would be great for me. I haven't even been in the sun other than going to and from my car, but the area around my nose is so dry, peeling, itchy and red. It looks like I have a bad sunburn. Even putting aloe on it to combat the redness stings now. DON""T buy this unless you have oily skin."
"I bought this product after I finished a different Neutrogena moisturizer which I loved (the spf 15 one). This product smells very medicinal, and completely dried out the skin around my eyes and on my eyelids. It also burns a lot when I have put additional moisturizer on top of the dry patches of skin. I wish I could return it but lost the receipt! Never buying again."
"I have been using this product for a few weeks and my skin has become increasingly dry. I thought it was just a new cleanser I was using, but when I stopped using the cleanser, the problem still persisted and realized that it was this moisturizer. The skin around my mouth and my chin feel extremely dry and are very red. I don't recommend this product."
"This moisturizer causeme an allergy, I 've been having problems in my face since that, now I can't wear any kind of sunscreen, I hate this."
"I love the higher Spf with the non greasy texture. Also the pump is so easy to use , especially when you have a baby on your hip."
"I use this everyday and it's exactly what my skin were needing all this time, it doesn't leave and oily sensation and moisture perfectly"
"I bought this about a week ago. Every time I apply, parts of my face get this tingly, slightly irritated sensation that's slowly been increasing. Will stop using."
"I would reccomend this product to take the place of sunscreen for outdoor events, however, I would not recomend it for wear under make up because it makes you look extremely greasy before you even leave the house."
"This product softens and moisturizes my skin without that oily clogging feel! Spf 35 is great for living in the desert where the air is warm, dry and always sunny! I really love this product!"
"My skin is peeling off by it self after using this product. I've seen some good reviews, but this one is not for my skin type. I would like my money back."
"I've used various Neutrogena moisturizers for years, and this one is the best for me. If I'm out in the sun, the added SPF aids my health and skin preservation."
This is my second time repurchasing this product because the other one expired. It does an okay job at moisturizing my own skin but after 2 hours in my t-zone gets extremely oily.
"I discovered this moisturizer by accident and realized that I needed to get this product. I use it everyday and my skin has never looked better. I almost if ever wear make, it's just me and my favorite products!!"
This is wonderful stuff! It has no oily slick feeling and when the directions say use only one pump it means it! One pump completely covers a clean just washed face and neck and it is just right under makeup. This is a very good product!
This moisturizer actually makes my skin feel soft and it doesn't break me out! I love it!
Used on vacation to Florida. Worked so well even the teenage girls borrowed it.
use as sunscreen lotion .
"I was looking for a daily face moisturizer that would have some skin protection and thought that I would try a premium one for best results. I used this product two days in a row to find that I had a dark red, bumpy rash all over my face. The rash lasted about 3 days. I think the culprit is the Oxybenzone contained in this product."
Have been using this product since the summer and it works great! I have combination skin with acne breakouts once a month. It does not irritate my acne or flare it up. My skin does not feel greasy and it works well under makeup. At the end of the day my skin is well hyrdated without looking greasy. So far this has been the best moisturizer with spf I have used.
This product works well for those of us who love the outdoors at protecting the skin from the rays of the sun.
Love this item - it does exactly it says and kills acne on the spot.
"I love this product. It goes on smoothly and easily, it disappears into the skin instead of being pasty and white. Smells great too."
This cream is a wonderful ( and inexpensive ) way of keeping my dry skin moisturized while protecting it against the sun.
I love this stuff! It works great for me for daily use and it doesn't break me out. I have somewhat sensitive skin and this gives me no issue.
I have been using this for years now. Even my husband likes it. It's light and absorbs quickly. Not greasy at all. I put it on every morning.
I used this product for about a week and then developed a rash. I stopped using it but my face is now peeling.
"I've never had any problems with any of my fave Neutrogena products. They make my skin feel clean, smooth and filled with moisture."
"This moisturizer softens my skin without feeling greasy. For that reason, I use it every day, and highly recommend it."
Very light. Goes on your skin smooth. Summer is here protect your face and keep it moisturize. I love this product. I use it everyday.
"I bought this for my niece; she has acne, and the medications she uses to control the acne dry her skin and leave it sore and rough. This moisturizer is a godsend."
This would be good if it wasnt for the parabens in it. Parabens increase your risk of skin cancer.
"When you choose to remove methylisothiazolinone, and the parabens, I will gladly purchase this product. After skin sensitivity testing by my dermatologist one month ago, I am still blistering from both of these ingredient test sites."
"I was really excited to get this moisturizer because I've heard many great things about it. Unfortunately, it's nothing like I thought it would be. It's pretty much like sunscreen....actually its exactly like sunscreen. There is no moisturizing quality what-so-ever and the scent is just straight up sunscreen."
"Why would Neutrogena say it was alcohol free when the ingredients say ""Cetearyl Alcohol, Behenyl Alcohol."" I can feel certain spots on my face that feel dry. I wish this was life the Oil-Free Moisture SPF 15 which doesn't have the drying effects of alcohol. Maybe it's the higher spf but they should figure out a way to due without the alcohol. It's really bad for pimples."
"This is great for protecting the skin from UVB rays, however it doesn't feel very moisturizing. I use this so that marks left behind from acne don't become darker. It works well for that, but my skin doesn't feel very moisturized unless I use a lot of it. I also feel that ingredients used for SPF cause acne for me, so I will probably get a moisturizer without SPF and wear a hat to protect my skin instead."
"I have very sensitive skin. It is a combination between dry and flaky, yet very oily. I am also prone to acne. I have searched for a long time for a moisturizer that wont make my skin more oily than it already is. All moisturizers I have tried in the past have also burned my skin when I apply it. This product doesn't burn my face or turn it beat red when applied, it works! It takes care of my dry skin, and though it doesn't help with my oily face, it doesn't cause me to break out! I love this moisturizer and would recommend this to anyone."
"No stinging, no drying GREAT!!! Best Ever!!! SPF 35 is great for desert sun."
No me gustó. Me ha dejado la cara con grasa y mi piel es grasa y esa no era la intención.
I like this moisturizer because it makes my skin so dewy and soft! I would order this again.
It was part of a gift to my grand and she was pleased with the product brand and I was happy because I shopped from home
this is nice moisturizer made even nicer because it has spf built in. it is still really smooth on my skin
This product leaves such a nice finish on my face and just the right amount of SPF. Great for every day.
"It is wonderful, it last majority of the day. By the time the night comes, you can put on again to hydrate your face. Your face feels excellent all day, especially for the winter. It's amazing. I would definitely recommend this"
I have been using this moisturizer for a year now. My skin is soo smooth and soft. I have acne and this works well with my acne medicine. I must keep my skin moisturized while using acne products. This moisturizer is the best I ever tried.
"This is the first moisturizer that I've found has a high SPF yet is non-oily and does not have the sun block smell. There is no need to pay tons of money for the fancy moisturizers with a high SPF, this one does the job and is affordable. I have used the Oil Free Moisture SPF 15 for years, and now this one will be replacing it for many more years to come."
"I'm 74 with normal to oily skin so jumped at the chance for a moisturizer to use in the warm weather..........THIS IS NOT THE ONE, folks!!!"
"First time I used it, my skin was all shiny, etc. oh well, I thought, it has to be absorbed......WRONG.. my face was shiny all day long......like when I was 17!! so...sorry, Neutrogena; I'm a retired makeup artist & usually recommended your products, but this one? very disappointing......still like your other stuff, though!!!"
"Nice to have the higher SPF in a relatively lightweight formula, but this just felt too sticky and greasy on me. I have combination skin, and live in a warm and humid climate. I think this would work best for skin that tends to be less oily, more dry, and for someone living where it won't melt off their face! Didn't seem to leave much white residue like some sunscreens do, absorbed fairly well. I'll use up the rest of the bottle on my arms but use something else on my face!"
"This is my first time purchasing this product. I noticed the same day I was using it that my lips started burning (where the lip skin meets the regular skin). At first I didn't know what was causing that so I used Blistex which helped. Then the next day the same thing. Then it dawned on me I was using a new moisturizer so I went back to my previous version (lower SPF) and it went away. I can't help but think after a week of back and forth with this, it's because of this product. I won't be buying this again."
This product goes on smooth and I love how it has just enough sunscreen!
"When you try this your life will be so much better. You don't have to worry about the bright sunny days ruining your skin, just sit back and relax this great product will go to any measures to treat your skin like it should. Life can't get better than this! Don't sweat it, you need something like this to give you rest assurance that people who created this product really know what they are doing! For once in my life your life will be so much easier when you know your in good hands!"
This moisturizer absorbs quickly and goes on well under makeup.
I have sensitive and it works very good for me. I totally recommend!
"Covers the skin well, I just wish they would make a sport version, if you sweat with this on, it will dissolve."
I bought this product because I needed higher SPF protection than what I was using but from day one my face burns so much every time I apply it. And although it says it's oil free I feel my skin very greasy.
"I don't know what it is thats in this that broke me out, but I was fine till i used this. Literally broke me out after the first use. If you ANY type of Acne.....walk away!!!!!!"
"Great daily cream and with SPF Pro: It moisturize, soft skin, feels good, stay longer, no oily, for daily, easy to use, worth. Cons: At the very beginning feels greasy but it left in a minute."
I didn't like this product. It didn't seem to moisturize my skin enough and I felt kinda greasy after a while. It also made my skin blotchy and red. :(
I really love this product. I don't get shinny face!
This is a great product! Would definitely recommend it to everybody!
This product goes on nice and smooth. It feels great all day.
this stuff really works i just bought it today a little expensive but works and its not greasy
"This facial lotion is the worst you have ever try, it saids oil free, but it leaves your face oily, yuck..... don't buy it."
