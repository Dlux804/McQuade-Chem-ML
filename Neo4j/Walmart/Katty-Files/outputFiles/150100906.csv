I've gone through some serious skincare. I came back to an oldie but a goodie!!! This kit has everything you need to safely and instantly do an in home peel. It's so amazing and such a great smell of citrus!!! It really is a wonderful product and definitely going to be a repurchase for me!!!
I'v always had combination skin
"good product and bonus cleanser, face feels soft after cleansing and mositurizer helps dry skin in turn smooths away wrinkles. I have been using this a while now. I hate when I forget to mositurize I can see and feel the differance on those forgetful days."
"I'll buy again. Only takes a small amount of cleanser on my face. Ran out of it and was a week before I could get more; used another brand and my face showed break outs. Back on this a week and clear face again. Moisturizer takes only a small amount, absorbs quickly, and leaves no greasy feeling. Face and neck are smooth and soft. Great products! I got 2 of the combos so I don't run out again."
"I think anyone over 35, should use Olay products. When I was 20ish tried it and didn't notice difference. Now, I do and I love Olay."
I love it it works perfectly I think people should use it one pro is that it helps your skin look beautiful it is super effective it did not disappoint me fore it is affordable and I think for other people it is as well I would totally recommend this
Olay skin care anti-aging skin care duo pack is the right product for those of us who are reaching higher ages of life. Smoothing fine lines and wrinkles while leaving the face and waste your eyes in a pleasant looking package is what this product gave to me.
I have used this product for over a year know and have noticed a difference in my skin. It has gotten softer and some of the fine lines have disappeared. Great product.
Great product works really good. Makes my skin feel very soft. It's expensive but worth the money.. it's very effective I've noticed a difference under my eyes where most my lines are. I think it's very high dollar cream for a fair price. I would recommend this product
Honestly I dont remember wow results. But I do remember a result. One thing I didn't like was that my skin looked and felt greasy for a long time after I used it. Very affordable though when compared to what I do now. On a budget or for people who have dry skin or perhaps are going for a dewy look i might suggest it.
"I love this product so much! It leaves me with the results I've been looking for. I recommend this to anyone having problems with their acne! I love skin treatments I love products that leave my skin looking and feeling great, this is the one product!"
"Olay has always been my favorite. My mother used Olay her entire life and you could tell because even in her 70's her skin was silky and smooth with slight crow feet around her eyes. I have at the age of 52, have high hopes for the same results, so far so good."
love this only skin care advanced antiaging skincare dual pack is absolutely amazing and my skin it feels nice and soft and smells great I am very happy with this product it is a very affordable I do you have into recommend you try this product is very well worth every penny that you spend on it.very clean and soft
This product is a very good soap which i found in the store.. i believe it's pros and will work for your skin.. it's very effective nd leaves your skin refreshing and nice.. it's affordable as well and cheap at any store near u .. i firmly recommend it!!!!
"i do not like this product because i have not seen a difference in the pores or wrinkles of my skin since i have used this product. i wouldn't recommend this to others because it does not make a difference. the packaging is easy to use, but i would not buy again"
"Excellent combo pack, my favorite cleanser and moisturizer together!"
I use it morning and night. It actually makes it easier to apply my makeup in the morning and helps with removing it at night. I am not positive as of yet if it is working as far as wrinkles go but i know it makes my face feel great.
I tried a sample of Olay Regenerist for the first time and I instantly saw a change in my skin after using a few times. The wrinkles that are forming around my eyes are not as noticeable as before. I'll definitely keep using for better results.
"I have extremely sensitive and dry skin and this product works miracles on my skin. It leaves my face feeling baby soft, and soothed. Its become part of my skincare routine and I recommended it to everyone that I know!"
"This product is okay, not much that I love or hate about it. It didn't leave a film layer on my skin afterwards which is nice but didn't do much for me personally."
Love the scent and it keeps my face moisturized! Love how it makes my skin feel! I'm not sure it helps wit age lines but I still like it. It is a little pricy.
I have had great success with Oil of Play products. Love the way my face and neck feel after using this. I get skin care in a cleanser. Its a win/win.
"I love Olay for an awesome over the counter skin care line that is effective, proven, loved, and worth the price! I've used Olay for years and always get compliments on looking way younger than I am. Shhh!"
"Obsessedddd with their wipes, it removes make up so smoothly and leave your skin fresh. What's best is its anti-anging and that's what I am mostly concern about"
"Good product, I got this as a gift from a friend and it really worked well for her so when I received it, i tried it and it did the job. Definitely going to keep buying this product in the future. Really recommend."
"Is a good product for me, i like how my face feels after i used it an i been noticing some changes in my face the wrincles dont go away but they become softer and with the days you can see them less."
I am in love with all of my IT cosmetics products but this one completely blew every under eye cream I have ever used out of the water. It goes on so smoothly and you immediately notice a difference before applying make up.
"It was an amazing product to use. Smooth on the skin. I really like the nice colour used. I have problems with most skin products but, this one was really good. I would recommend this product to everyone!"
Olay has always been a staple product for me. It's a decent price and decent cream. My skin always feels amazing after using it. I feel like it does what it says it does.
"First you take away the foaming cleanser that so many, including myself, liked, then we try the the Gentle Clean, which is not quite as good, and now you reduce the package size? Looking elsewhere. i recommend it for sure but it could be better"
"Awsome moisturizer! Not to oily. I have sensitive skin, it been working well so fat."
Everything you need in one convenient pack. Olay products are great at keeping skin moisturized hence keeping your skin looking younger and erasing damages!
Very happy with my purchase! I feel like I bought two items for the price of one.
"Skin is soft , haven't had it long enough to really give it a fair review."
I always use Oil of Olay Regenerist products at night before I go to bed . Oil of Olay is part of my skin care regimen
Iike this rellay good i love it ...... It is perfect before makeup... It is skin care to your face......
I love this product because it prevent your skin from aging. It also give your skin hydration and makes your skin refreshed
"Best product Ive ever used and wouldnt recommend another, will continue using this for a while! Its awesome!"
"I always love having these when I travel, quick clean in the car, airplane or any where, gives my face a quick wake up leaving my skin flawless!"
"Smells great! Use small pea size on face works well ,not greasy or oily Clean smelling, some what reasonable price"
Over all great product will continue to use I dabble in all great skin care. Love it so much. I will recommend this product to all my peeps.
It is a great product. It is a good value for a wonderful product to use daily. I love the feel of the moisturizer on my skin.
This is a great product for women over thirty five. The results were amazing my face looks so much younger and fresh. Truly loved it.
I love the formula of this anti-aging skin care!! I never used anti-aging products before.. but this has really changed my life!
Nor super impressed. I see other products for less that work just as well or better. Moisturizing is average. Would not repurchase.
I was disappointed in this product. Not worth the money. Did not work well for me. I would not reccomend.

This has really helped me with my fine forehead lines. After just one use they were almost non existent! I highly recommend!
Face cleanses is a must and I love this soo much it's so smooth and amazing will definitely buy again
Great price. Smells wonderful. Works like a dream. Face was so smooth and fresh. Easybto find in stores.
Olay really does understand skin and all of their products have been completely beneficial for my complex skin type!
"If don't see any noticable difference in skin tone, discoloration or blemish loss. Scent smelled nice but was kinda harsh for everyday use"
not the results that i thought i was going to get but works ok... not tge best for dry skin... woupdnt recommend
"Not heavy, not greasy, and makes my skin feel good. I don't know how it works for wrinkles since I don't have any, but I like this moisturizer."
Love the Olay products. They always seem to do their job great. They are not harsh on the skin and always make my skin feel soft
Its pretty decent but not sure if I see any effects after a while I think its very temporary but maybe its just my skin
I love how smooth my skin feels after I use this. it has a nice scent and it feels good on my face. This product makes my fine lines disappear.
great product! i got this for my mom for christmas last year and it's keeping her looking young! it's very effective!
"This is a good product. I think it was definitely full of all the wonderful things my skin needed. I cannot complain about anything that the product claimed because it did a good job. My only complaint was how it made my skin feel, it was a tad greasy and for me that is a no no."
"I like it a lot, it went well, there's no problem that you buy it, I liked it too that"
I used this as part of my nightly skincare routine and it left my skin soft and smooth.
"Wow, What Can I Say This Product Has Worked Magic !! I Would Highly Recommend To Anyone."

"It's so good. It has helped with dryness and dullness under my eyes. I continue to use it to see if I'll see more improvement. So far, it's been great. Wish it were a little cheaper for being an over the counter brand."
I love this product! I use it daily to fight skin aging and fine lines and wrinkles. It works really well and makes my face feel rejuvenated and younger. It also makes my face feel very clean and soft.
Best skincare products ever! I love the scent and how it doesn't irritate my skin! Also it is very affordable and just part of my daily skincare routine! I highly recommend this brand always to my friends and family!
This is an amazing product all around. it helps the skin return to its normal texture and look in as little as 2 weeks. i highly reccomend this product
"Im only 18, but I feel if i start keeping my skin tight from now on, it will be better in my 30's. I see what the oil does to my skin is it keeps it tight n in place."
Pricey but worth it. Don't leave bad residue on my skin. Smell is ok. I like the after glow I hold while using this product I have many bottles at home
Fantastic! I would definitely recommend this to a friend or family member. I would definitely buy this again soon!
This is nice product. Very helpful . I suggest this product to my friends and family. It is worth buying.
