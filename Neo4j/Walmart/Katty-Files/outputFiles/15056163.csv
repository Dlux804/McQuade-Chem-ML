This cream is wonderful. It leaves my skin wonderfully soft and doesn't feel greasy.
I have been using Ultra-Lift Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream for years and it works. I also use Ultra Lift eye cream. I have very sensitive skin and can use very few products without a skin reaction and I do not get a skin reaction from these products. I am wondering if the Night Cream is discontinued as I can not find it anywhere on Long Island.
"I've been using Garnier SkinActive Ultra-Lift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Night Cream for years and people tell me I look a lot younger than I am. It absorbs quickly, plumps and moisturizes my face. When my face is especially dry I even use it in the morning and under makeup. I have sensitive skin and it has never irritated my skin. I'm also sensitive to perfumes"
"I had always wanted to try this. I found a sale and used some coupons to get a great deal. I put this on at night and I can feel it working. When i get up in the morning, my skin feels silky smooth and my eyes aren't as puffy as they used to be. It smells pleasant and has a non greasy texture. Way to go, Garnier!"
"I have never written a product review before, but this anti-wrinkle firming night cream actually works and I just had to let the world know. I recently turned 60 and did not like all the wrinkles I was seeing on my face and especially my neck after losing over 100 lbs. A daily regimen of this cream has made a difference after 2 mos. regular use. What's more he price is so reasonable compared to other very expensive products that I tried and that did not show any difference."
"Started using this about two weeks ago. I have witnessed a huge change in my damaged skin texture, smoothing my skin. Despite what I initially anticipated through adding heavy moisturizer to my face, I also haven't been breaking out as much! Last, the fine lines are disappearing in addition to one heavier line that is improving drastically. The cherry on top, it smells beautiful! Thank you Garnier for making an affordable, easily accessible, wrinkle cream that works!"
"I love Ultra Lift night cream. After one day, my skin felt better and looked brighter. The more I use it the more I love it. With regular use, my skin is firmer, smoother and much clearer. I actually got a compliment on my skin while standing in a grocery store line the other day. I am 52 and haven't had that in a long time! It feels great going on, like I am really nourishing my skin. My skin feels soft and smooth, but not greasy. I HIGHLY recommend this product!"
"If you have ever used Retin-A before, you know how much your skin aches while it is peeling layers away. Ultra-Lift seems to be doing the same thing, but I don't want to claw my face off! Instead, my face looks radiant & feels great to the touch. Helps diminish fine lines & shrinks pores too. Really a great product & one I will never be without."
"I've been using this night cream for several months and my skin feels tighter, more toned. My skin actually tingles when I apply it. My only complaint is I wish it came in a pump package or tube. I dislike using facial products in a jar as they are exposed to air (and who knows what else) every time you you remove the lid. Other than that, I love it!"
"Like most people, gravity has been pulling on my once firm facial skin - I chose to try this product to 'lift and firm', especially the 'comma lines' around my mouth... I have been using this cream for approximately 2 weeks, and so far haven't noticed any appreciable difference,other than some reddening of my cheeks. I will give Garnier a few more weeks and if I don't achieve the results I seek, my quest will continue- next try will be boots #07..."
"I simply love this eye cream, it's soothing, moisturizing, and does the job that high priced products barely do. The best part is that it has SPF and we all need that from sun and squinting in the daylight. I love the moisture gel for face also. My GO TO.. must have products."
I don't like it it burns my face when I apply it
"After only three nights using this product, my skin feels so much softer and looks amazing. I have already had comments from people! I would recommend this to everyone!"
"I've been using this product for 3 years and liked the wonderful smell when I applied it. I just bought the ""new"" formula and the wonderful smell of roses is missing."
"Garnier Ultra Lift Anti-Wrinkle Firming Night Cream is a wonderful product. Not only does it moisturize your skin, but it helps to over time reduce signs of wrinkles as well as firm your skin up. The cream smells great and it doesn't cost alot."
"I'm 18 and started using this because I knew retinol was good for acne. I had lots of little whites heads and blackheads on my forehead and after about a week or two and picking at them, they have noticeably reduced in amount and size. I use it twice a day and it has helped my skin"
"Ran out of G eye cream; tried another product, but had sensitivity issues (burning on application). Will be returning to Garnier!"
You can feel it working but be careful . I put some next to my mouth around my frown lines and woke with huge lips.
It really works in one week everyone say you look ten year younger people ask me what are you doing .
Awesome product. I love the way it makes my skin look and feel after using it. I would recommend this product to anyone.
"This creme works great!!! It's only been a week, and I can see a huge improvement!! Less wrinkles, and soooo smooth!! :)"
"The cream is nice and thick with a wonderful smooth consistency that feels fabulous when applied. As for it eliminating fine lines and wrinkles... well, I didn't have one of those amazing before and after photo stories. I also don't really feel as if there was any ""lifting"" done. I'm prone to puffiness under my eyes, and that didn't seem to improve at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is great! I have sensitive skin. I have not been red, itchy or any breakouts. What I do have is vibrant, clear and even skin tone. Easily applied, not greasy. I have a sensitive nose as far as scents and I haven't noticed the smell bothering me at all. When my skin completely dries, my face is left soft and smooth. Not feeling like a film is there. I like it so much I am switching to their day cream. This review is part of a Bzz agent product review, with my own opinion of the product."
My skin feels super soft after using this. I definitely recommend
"I use this for two weeks now, and I like it. Feels good on my skin, smells very good, not greasy."
FANTASTIC. THANK YOU. LOVE DOING BUSINESS WITH YOU.
"i love this product,its work really good especially on my wrinkles [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall a good night cream. This is my second purchase of this cream and I have found that when you get down to the last 15% to 20%, you get a split appearance and I have to mix it with my finger a little."
I was amazed about the packing and how anti wrinkle cream really works this product is just simply admazing.. Thank you very much for letting me try it . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I found that this cream was very moisturizing and not tacky to my skin. I did not notice any firming going on after repeated use. I am continuing to use the product and see if longer term use produces any further benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love the brand in general. I like this night cream very much. The scent is very light and feminine. The cream is a little bit greasy on my skin, but it is not any issue at all by the time I wake up. The price of this product is definitely affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed this product. It is lightweight but made my skin a little oily at first and then soaks in. I wouldn't use it in the morning as it makes my skin a little shinny. I didn't break out at all. I did notice the bags under my eyes went down slightly and it made my skin look softer with a few less wrinkles. It doesn't have a strong smell which is nice. Overall a nice night cream that definitely hydrates my skin. I tend to have dryer skid in the winter so I will most likely use this then. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This firming cream stated in the label that your skin will look and feel younger in just 5 days! I was excited to try a new cream just for night. Unfortunately, this cream didn't do much for me. It is light weight. I guess when I hear night cream I think of something more heavy duty. I'm on my 3rd week and while it feels nice and doesn't have any annoying frangeance I don't feel like it's doing much even in the way of moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really didn't see too much of difference after using this product for two weeks. Although I really don't have wrinkles, the only difference I saw was in the hydration of my skin. After the first application, my skin felt so soft and smooth and it smells lovely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't care for this face cream. It seemed to go on nicely, but it didn't really soak into the skin. Because it didn't soak into the skin, my face always felt as though it was sticky or there wad lotionI didn't rub in all the way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When it comes to this moisturizer, anti-aging is the least of my concerns. Being 22, it's hard to tell if this actually made a difference in the ""fine lines"" I have. As for the formula itself, I appreciate how well this sinks in without leaving my skin feeling greasy. The smell is pleasant, without being overpowering. I do feel as though my skin is hydrated with this product, and will continue to use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how smooth my face feels after I apply this and when I wake up. It smells good, this is a really good price for the amount you get! I would recommend this it's a great moisturizer and I love how my face looks when I wake up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this stuff is great! I've tried other night creams and they mostly have what I call the ""vintage"" scent like my grandmother's cold cream. Garnier once again brings a fresh and fruity-smelling product that is definitely a modern twist. I don't have sagging skin or wrinkles yet, so I can't attest to how good it does at firming, but my skin definitely feels great after applying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is great!! I used it for about 3 weeks minus the days I forgot :) I recently loss some weight and it really changed the elasticity in my face. I have been looking for a good ""firming"" cream to use and this is it! I applied it at night before bed and not old did my skin look tighter it also felt better...more hydrated and softer. I made sure to not use it in my neck as well as my face and it helped there too. I can't wait to see my results in the long term! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Cream isn't greasy, and soaks into skin smoothly. It's not as light weight as I would like it but since it's a night cream and you're asleep that's OK. Definitely have high hopes that this cream will reduce lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The consistency of this product is very thick. When applied to the skin, it soaks in rather quickly and effectively. After several nights of using it, I noticed it moisturizied my skin alot and my skin's elasticity is a little better than before I started using it. Overall, I highly recommend buying it if you want to improve your skins elasticity. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's a great product. It made my skin feel softer on the first day. I've noticed a definite increase in how smooth my skin has been feeling. It doesn't make my skin oily, which is incredible for my skin type, and it's enough of a moisturizer at night. I don't have a ton of aging, so I don't know that I've noticed a difference there, but I'm sure after prolonged use I might. It's so easy to apply, and it'll last a while, because a little bit covers my entire face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product was pretty ok. I found it to be super hydrating. I put it on at the end of my face care routine, before bed. When I woke up the next morning, I could still feel the moisture. I'm not sure however, how anti-winkle it is. I noticed, maybe, a slight difference on the wrinkles on my forehead, but not much. So, if you're looking for a super moisturizer, this is a great product. If anti-winkle is your main focus, maybe look elsewhere. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The consistency of this product is very thick. When applied to the skin, it soaks in rather quickly and effectively. After several nights of using it, I noticed it moisturizied my skin alot and my skin's elasticity is a little better than before I started using it. Overall, I highly recommend buying it if you want to improve your skins elasticity. It is by far, one of the better firming creams on the market! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was hoping for night cream that made a difference and I gave it the good old try and it failed. The cream itself is lightweight and absorbs enough not to feel greasy but just doesn't meet my standards. It tingled my sensitive face for the first 4 days of using it and then the last couple of days I used it, it just didn't feel great. It has a light scent, however, I'm sensitive to scent so gave me that nauseous feeling. Too bad though... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is amazing. It left my skin so soft. The product smells amazing and it is absolutely different from other brands. My mom also started trying it with me and she loves it a lot! She loves the way her face is smooth and for her younger appearance is better. She and I will continue buying this product. It's a must have so buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It took longer than a week, but I have seen a change in the wrinkles fading . It also leaves your skin soft. I usually break out and with this I did not. I will buy it again when I run out! I would recommend this to anyone it's wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have given this product a full two weeks prior to giving a review. I use mostly Garnier products for my skin care needs. Using Ultra lift , I have noticed the fines lines around my eyes less noticable. I cant say I see a dramatic difference only because I am 40 and just starting to get fine lines. Its light weight and absorbs quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After trying this product for several weeks I honestly haven't noticed a difference in wrinkles. I will say being a twenty something female I don't have very many wrinkles to disguise (yet). On a plus side this product was not at all heavy- it was perfect for my oily/ dry skin combo. It also had a great smell! I probably would not buy it for myself, but I'm not necessarily in the market for a wrinkle cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really did not have high hopes that this would do anything other than smell good. I have lost weight recently and my neck has gotten a bit crepey, it's something that's really bothering me. Garnier Ultra-Lift Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream dramatically helped with this. I didn't notice that it has helped a lot with my forehead creases, but my neck looks so much better. I will continue to use this and hope it helps even more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wanted to use it for a couple of weeks to get the full effect of the cream and I love it! I am usually inconsistent in using night facial creams but I am going to stick to this one. I like the container it's in, small and doesn't take up a lot of space in my bathroom. It's a 1.7 oz. container but has a lot of cream in it. I only used about a pea sized amount of my finger about 3 times and it spreads fairly well. My skin (face and neck) is softer and looks a bit brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As a hard working young woman i decided to try the product. It is very simple to use. No harsh or greasy feel to it. I noticed within just a few times using this product how soft my skin looked and felt. Amd my wrinkles were starting to fade. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the way my skin feels after application. Makes me feel super soft. When I wake up in the morning it is still soft to the touch. When I went camping I didn't have to worry about my wrinkles and imperfections being prominent or how my skin looked or felt even without makeup on. Has made its way into the future regimen. My first picture has some foundation. The second has eye liner and mascara. The last has a little highlighter blush and mascara. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really have enjoyed this face cream. Within about 2 weeks of use I have noticed much softer and firmer skin. As far as wrinkles, I don't have too many of those yet, but I'm always happy to take preventative measures. I feel it has given my skin a more youthful appearance though. The smell is lovely also. I have already recommended this product to friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using it for 2 weeks. I think it smells really good! My skin feels smoother and more firm. The cream is thick but does not leave my skin sticky. When I wake up it's fully absorbed. I have sensitive skin that is prone to rash/allergic reactions, this cream has been good on my sensitive skin...I have had no unwanted irritation. I think with continued use I will begin to see even better anti-aging results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Nicely moisturizing with a good skin feel and it does not leaving an oily residue on the skin, but unfortunately I found it to be too highly fragranced for me to purchase in the future. I did not use product long enough to notice any anti wrinkle benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"From the instant I put this on I could feel how smoothe and light it is. It didnt feel cakey on my skin and instantly moisturized. After putting it on, my skin feels soft and not oily. I will definitely be including this in my nightly routine from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoy this product! I was super excited to try it and it lives up to it. I love how it feels going on and love the light smell to it. I have used it a couple nights now and i can feel my face is getting softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am loving this night cream. My skin feels wonderful. I have been using it on my face & also my neck, my friends say they can tell the difference. It has a slight scent to it but nothing overwhelming. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been wanting a night cream that is supposed to fight wrinkles and this one does the job! It smells great, and your skin feels tightened and moisturized. I cannot wait to keep using it and continuing to see the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm approaching 30, and I'm starting to notice more pesky wrinkles. I've been looking for a product that can help diminish those fine lines and I think I've found the perfect product now! I have sensitive skin and this night cream didn't cause any issues for me. Quick and easy application after I wash my face at night. Loving it! I highly recommend trying this Garnier Skin Active night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been useing this for the past 5 days and already can see and feel a difference in my face. It's smoother and I feel like it looks healthier and has a glow. I highly recommend this. This product is a great size amazing price. Nice fresh smell. Good texture and I love what it is doing to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this cream is brilliant. My skin tone is even, clear and vibrant. It does have a fragrance but it hasn't bothered me and I have a sensitive nose.Easily applies, leaves my skin soft, no residue or sticky feeling. I have sensitive skin and I haven't had any redness, irritation of any kind or breakouts. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ultra-Lift Anti Wrinkle Night Cream is a great product. It is lightweight and does not leave your skin oily. My face feels clean, moisturized and refreshed every morning when I wake up. I would recommend this product to friends of all ages. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am fairly new to wrinkle creams, so I was skeptical that it would do what it claims. I was pleasantly surprised! It absorbed easily and quickly into my skin and it didn't feel greasy. After a few days of use my fine lines were less noticeable. It made my skin feel smooth and hydrated. All in all my experience was a positive one. Try it for yourself, you won't regret it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wow! After just two uses of the night cream, I can already tell a difference in my skin. It's brighter, firmer and has more elasticity. I have sensitive oily skin, but the night cream is quickly absorbed into my skin and has not irritated it at all. Even my husband (who didn't know I was trying something new) noticed and said my skin was glowing. I'm definitely going to continue using this night cream and look into other products in this line. It's wonderful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love it! I generally have sensitive skin especially on my face, but this went on great. It left my skin feeling smooth and hydrated even when I woke up the next morning I could feel a difference. It little dab goes a long way and it has a nice fragrance as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a great overnight cream. I noticed my face was soft and smoother after one application. I tend to have dry spots around nose, chin and forehead and I did not the next day after using. It had a pleasant smell too, not overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This lightweight, non greasy formula smells very pleasant if you are attracted to perfume-y scents in you skin care. It has a light moisturizing effect but doesnt feel heavy on the skin which is important around the eyes! Garnier Skin Active New Ultra Lift Night Cream is great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Im rating immediate having it. I love the texture and smell and it makes my skin feel smooth. I havent really tried night creams but i look foward to seeing if theres results in a few weeks time. But as far as this product goes I do like the smell and how it makes my face soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product goes on nicely, non greasy feel ,doesn't take much to smooth on all over your face and neck. Really makes your skin feel soft.Ive only used it a week so as of yet I haven't seen really a difference wrinkle wise not that I have much but you do feel a difference skin texture wise. Smells great and not to Costly. A big Plus [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't have wrinkles but I wanted to be proactive. In less than 5 days I noticed brighter and softer skin. It is very light and has a great skin. I have acne prone skin. Unlike other products, this cream has not caused any acne or other skin irritation. This night cream has prompted me to explore other Garnier products."
Excellent
I did not get to use this because of the strong perfume which I found unpleasant. I had to wash my face and could still smell it. Why not a soft fragrance???? Am hesitant to try other products.
"I've been using this product for 6 days, so far I have noticed my skin looks so much healthier. It's super soft and has a nice glow. It feels a little tighter, and I've noticed the worry lines seem to be a less noticeable. Good product"
I think this product is pretty awesome! I definitely think it does what it says. The smell of the product could be nicer but it isn't too bad. Would definitely get this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I didn't see any results with this product. I had higher expectations because of the brand name. I am disappointed in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's so light-weight and creamy, but not greasy. And I noticed more of a difference in my skin than I expected. It's so much smoother and softer. Totally worth it!! Highly recommend it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely loved this. Made my face feel soft while it was working it's magic and lifting my face. My skin now has a firm dewy feel to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love that ultra lift leaves my face feeling ultra hydrated without a greasy feel and the very light sent is a great bonus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This night cream is amazing. It melts into your skin and is extremely moisturizing. It doesn't have a strong scent either. I'm definitely adding this product into my night time routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product cannot create miracles, but I believe it does help reduce the surface lines on the skin. Plus, it provides hydration for a nice fresh glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Im 16 and I wear makeup, but not a lot. I bought this moisturizer at because I was tired of oliveoil clogging my pores at night. This moisturizer is creamy and all of it absorbs in by the time you wake up. I havent seen dramatic changes in my face because I dont have ""skin aging problems"" but it does give me a GORGEOUS glow on my face if I take care of my skin like I supposed to. I like the glow because it doesnt make my skin greasy/oily, but just glowy in the morning!"
"After trying this product for a few weeks now, I have not seen a significant difference. But, it is extremely moisturizing and is very comfortable to have on throughout the night. Hopefully, if I continue to use this product, I will be able to see some results on my wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After trying this product every night now for a couple weeks, my complexion has seemed to be more clear. I haven't really noticed a difference in any current wrinkles, but maybe I need to keep using it for a bit longer. The smell is refreshing floral scent. Not too strong, just right. The cream is light and refreshing. It doesn't have a super thick/heavy feeling to it, which is nice. I'm going to keep using this night cream for a while. Overall I really liked this night cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this every night and it keeps my face looking wonderful. I do not have lines in my face like many women in my age group.
Goes on smooth. Looks that it actually helps with fine lines. Decent fragrance. Already went through one jar and working on 2nd one. age 65
"Light,non greasy,no smell. Great for sensitive skin."
I guess you get what you pay for
"I bought it for my Mom, she said it works!"
