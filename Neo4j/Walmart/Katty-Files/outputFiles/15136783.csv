"I am a middle aged, dark skinned women and this has been my daytime moisturizer since I was 17 years old. SPF 15 is perfect for me with my dark skin in the summer. Gives me the right amount of protection."
"I have been using this moisturizer for as long as I can remember, I love the fact it has spf 15 so I can use it every day and know my face won't burn. It's a light cream that's not heavy on your face."
"I started using Olay since I came here in the US, 16 years ago. A friend recommended it after I complained of dryness of my face. She told me that my skin is adjusting to the weather and i need moisturizer. Since then, I never used any other product. I even send this moisturizer to my mom and sister in the Philippines."
Love this face moisturizer. It is light and feels great on my skin. It moisturizes wonderfully! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is just right, in the mornings under makeup, or at night while you sleep.,"
"I have had a very, very, very hard time finding an SPF 15+ skin lotion that did not cause my face to break out. (In my case, I do not get black or white heads, as much as hard little white bumps underneath my skin.) I am very glad to have found this lotion! I can wear it in all kinds of weather (humid included) and it stays in tact and does not cause those annoying little bumps. I wish it came in a pump but - for the price - I can live without it."
"Love this product. I have used Olay lotion since high school, I'm now 67. I get compliments on my skin."
very good for dry skin
This product is ok! The cons is it is super watered down so it does not feel super moist on the skin! And after a while it begins to feel super oily! It can differentiate from others since everyoneâs skin is different. I have mixed skin oily/dry
The textures seems to be nice until it went on my face where it started to feel grainy and scratchy. It has the light smell of suncreen and I felt like I was putting sunscreen on rather than moisturizer. I will definitely try other products before I come back to this one.
I love this product and it meets all my needs. It's light-weight with sun protection. My skin feels soft smooth and very well moisturized all the time after I tried this. I'm very happy I got this.
"I live in FL, where the sun is a constant battle. I enjoy being tan, but I do not want the wrinkles that go along with a tan. I've use Olay daily moisturizer every day and people consistently card me, or think I'm younger than what I look like- I just turned 35yrs old. I think my young look is definitely attributed to the daily use of Olay face moisturizer. I highly recommend that all girls and ladies use this product."
My mother started me using this when I was very young. I had been using other products that contained vitamin A and C. But they started burning my eyes. So I went back to my trusty old friend Oil Of Olay and it feels so good when applied. I am 61 and my skin is in good shape and seems to be better now that I have gotten away from the creams with the acids in them.
"I bought this a couple days ago. I had perfect skin, no acne or anything but once I applied this to my face my face instantly started burning I thought it was because my face was really dry because that was the reason why I bought a moisturizer in the first place my skin was a little bit on the dry side. BIGGEST MISTAKE I MADE. I now have a rash all over my face around my mouth, eyes, cheeks, forehead my face looks so ridiculously red. Would not recommend this to anyone."
I often go between high end moisturizers and drug store brand. This is one for my favorite cheaper products. Good for daily moisture. Subtle smell and SPF which is good. I have oily skin and it does make me a little shiny which is why I took away two stars.
"I have been using this product ever since I can remember, and I started using it because my mom had been using it, also ever since I can remember. The moisturizer is extremely moisturizing, all while being light weight and non greasy. It keeps my face moisturized and my T zone, non greasy. All of this coupled with SPF keeps my face protected and moisturized, all day everyday. I have never trusted a brand more than I do with Olay. I have used this product forever and I now use their anti line at night, as well."
"I've been using this moisturizer complete with SPF 15 FOR OVER 10 YRS NOW, I LOVE IT N I WILL CONTINUE TO USE IT IN THE FUTURE. IT'S GOT VITAMINS E B3 & C IN IT N I LOVE TO USE IT ON MY FACE N NECK. THANKS OLAY MY FACE LOOKS SO YOUNG BECAUSE I HAVE PEOPLE ASKING ME ABOUT HOW YOUNG I LOOK N I'M 58 NOW. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK U R DOING ! THANKS !"
I have been using this product for a long time many years and I find this product to be very dependable makes my skin look younger softer and very feminine. The fragrance is very pleasant and leaves my skin feeling fresh and smooth. Thanks Olay for all your wonderful products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used oil of Olay since the age if 16 and about to turn 50 and must say these are truly the best products out there to continue to look and feel your best as we age graciously. I do tell my daughters to continue using for the best skin as they age as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product twice a day for at least ten years. I put it on before my foundation and at night after cleansing my face. I also use it on my neck and upper chest area daily for everyday moisture and sun protection. It goes on light and smooths in immediately. I am 54 and get compliments on my skin from total strangers. I absolutely love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's a wonderful product, not heavy, very light, yet very effective. Have used it since I was 15 yrs old and now I am 55 yrs old and I can see that using this regiment everyday has had a wonderful effect on my skin !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I use the Olay cleanser and then the complete moisturizer for sensitive skin daily. My skin looks and feels great! I am 50+ and find this regimen to keep my skin looking younger and I would recommend these products to anyone regardless of age. My daughters also use the moisturizer and are very pleased with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did not really start wearing makeup on a daily basis until I was in my 30's about 30 years ago! I started using OLay and it is all I have ever used. From time to time I have received samples of other moisturizer but never bought a full size version of the sample. Olay just works for me and it always has. Now my daughter is in her 30's and she tells me that I look younger than my 59 years so it must be working. Thank you for this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is great. I have been using it on my face for years every day as it keeps my skin so soft. It is also a great sunscreen protector as I even have my husband using it on his face for sun protection as he is outside working all day. I recommend it to anyone that has any skin issues.

I have been using Olay daytime moisturizer with broad spectrum spf 15 for 2 years now. I love the way my skin looks and feels! The spf is perfect for me and the moisturizer level is great! I very much recommend this product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been told by strangers, friends and family that I don't look my age and that's because of my daily use of the Olay soap and moisturizer. My skin looks great because it's tight and feels like silk, and I have been using Olay for over ten years. I don't use foundations or a lot of make-up because I feel that the Olay products are complete!!!! Thanks for giving me a youthful look after all of my 63 years and I will continue to use the soap and moisturizer on a daily basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

My 85 years old mother introduced me to this product since the age of 14. I'm 38 now and use it religiously. My mother only uses the sod moisturizer and looks beautiful. People are amazed that she looks 70 or younger. Everyone I know thinks I buy expensive moisturizers since my face don't have as much sun damage as they do. I love your product. Now I have my 15 year old daughter using it. It's our family secret. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using Oil of Olay for more than 30 years, and I love it! Non-greasy, moisturizing lotion that makes me feel (and look?) younger than I am! My mother used it for years, and passed along the beauty of this product to me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried many moisturizers over the years but it never fails that I keep coming back to this one. What can l say true love never dies. I love the way this lotion sinks into your skin without the greasy feel others provide. The smell is also very light and not overpowering. Last but not least it truly works ! My skin looks wonderful for fifty. I have been using this for many years and the results show on my face. Thanks Olay, I couldn't of done it without you.

"I have been using Olay complete all day moisiurizer as long as I have been using a facial moisturizer, and I love it. I use it before bedtime and when I awake, or when I just need to freshen up my face. It leaves my face feeling moist and dewy and my makeup flows over it with ease. That says a lot because I am 76 years old. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I put this product on every morning. I wash my face and the moisturizes goes on even before I put on my foundation. I love the fact that it has sunscreen. My face looks smooth and healthy and the best part, it last all day long! I have normal to dry skin and I have tried many products and this is by far the BEST! I have been using Oil of Olay for over 40 years and I will never switch to anything else! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I began using Olay products because that is all my grandmother used and her skin was GORGEOUS! Not only does this moisturizer keep my skin looking great but it also keeps it super soft. The added benefit of an SPF of 15 gives me peace of mind when out in the sun. I also appreciate that in one step I get 2 complete benefits! Thanks Grandma and thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I first tried Olay many years ago, and used it for quite a few years. Then, I thought other products might be better, so I tried all kinds of them. I am back to using Olay, I trust it and it always is perfect for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Olay Moisturizer since I am 30 years old. I am now a 73 yr old woman. People cannot believe my age. I have no wrinkles on my face and neck. I am always asked what do I do to have such great skin...My answer is I use Olay everyday and I have never used any other product on my face and neck. I am told many many times that I have ""unbelievable skin"" !!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturizer and use it every day, all year round. In the summer, I also put it on the backs of my hands to have the added sun protection! I remember watching my mom use ""pink"" Olay every day and never thought I would be using Olay products all of my life! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using your moisturizer for at least 15 years. I know that my skin looks and feels great. Most people that don't know me think I am 10 years younger than my real age! And this is largely to do with your product. I love it, and I won't go a day without it! Thanks!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for over a year. It is very light weight and goes on smooth. It is not thick and heavy. The SPF 15 is a plus for the winter and cold months. I sometimes use it as a base coat in the summer and then I put on a SPF 30, later. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Oil Of Olay moisturizer for the past 23 years, as I noticed a change in my skin after childbirth. I love that it has a SPF of 15 because I work outside and need the extra protection. I have tried other products and always go back to Oil Of Olay. It feels great on my skin and I trust the protection it gives. Thanks for a great product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for many years and it is a great moisturizer for my skin. I wear it under my makeup and I enjoy a very good look for my skin. I am 81 years and I continually get compliments and hear that my skin looks like that of a much younger woman. I have always been pleased with how it makes my skin look.

"Very good, reasonably priced every-day moisturizer. Absorbs quickly. Makeup can be easily applied over the Complete. I put it on first thing in the AM, but if I plan to be outside for more than 1/2 hour, I also use #45 sunblock. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I somehow convinced myself there was something better than Olay...and I spent lots of money seeking that product out. Guess what? I'm back and I'm here to stay. There is nothing better.

"This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. When you put it on in the morning, at night you can still feel the softness. I have never gotten a sunburn on my face after using this product. If it is very hot temperatures I always add another coat just for the extra protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for about 30 years. I never go without it on my face. When I sweat during running, I end up with a horrible taste in my mouth with other moisturizers. I have never had that problem when I use Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer. I like the fact that I always have sunscreen on my face! This is the one cosmetic product that I will not be without or go anywhere without! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was looking for a moisturizer and had heard Oil of Olay was great. Tried it and love the way it is not greasy and does not take much to use on my face each morning before going out in the New England cold weather and before putting on a fresh face of makeup. I feel really bad if i forget so i have my bottle on my dresser so that each and every morning that is done before i put on my watch to leave for work or to go out at night.

I am happy with Olay Complete and especially like the knowledge that my skin is protected to some degree by sunscreen. Living in a Florida beach town it is impossible nor would I want to avoid the sun yet want to take every precaution against sun damage. I don't want to look or act my age but enjoy living near the ocean and feel that using your products has been beneficial towards my goal. Thank you.

I like this moisturizer- it does a good job and does not leave my skin feeling dry or break me out. It could be a little less expensive but other than that I like it a lot. The eye cream is also nice. Olay is almost always the brand that I buy and use every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"While fighting Basal Cell Carcinoma for the last twenty years, I need to moisturize and protect. My mother when I was younger introduced me to the beauty of Olay, she used it and had skin as beautiful as a 30 year old when she was in her later years.

"I just picked up my first jar of Olay complete and I LOVE IT! The texture is not greasy, andngreat to put on my face. It isnincredibly smooth. It is the first time I've ever looked forward to putting on moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin ready for makeup. My face also doesn't feel as oily by the end of the day. Thanks Olay!"
Its awesome! I moisturizes my face without over or under moisturizing. It even has a pleasing yet not over bearing smell. I love it! My roommate even complimented me after I started using it saying how my skin looked great and looked like it was glowing!
"I was pleased with the feel of my skin after using the Olay Complete with SPF 15. It has a nice scent, and it is barely noticeable (feeling) on my skin after I apply it. I use topical medication on my face 20 minutes prior to applying Olay Complete, and the Olay Complete does not aggravate my skin or counteract the medication. I am so pleased to have the SPF already in the product because I have had sun damage over the years."
"I hated all face sunscreen because I would always get terrible blocked pores and acne (even cystic). I finally found the one. The sensitive skin one I use is very light weight and doesn&#39;t cause me any problems. It doesn&#39;t feel like sunscreen is on, with that mask-like feeling. You may need to reapply if you&#39;re sunbathing or sweating. Oh yeah, it doesn&#39;t really burn the eyes like so many do. I was happy to find my miracle!"
"Use daily and couldn't be more pleased,it is perfect for what I want. Not greasy, keeps my face moist and I don't need anything heavy, use it under my makeup and have been happy with it for years.I have very few wrinkles.I am not real sure how long I have used it, I know for a long time."
"I used Olay as a teen but then switched to more expensive brands. My skin has changed and became extremely sensitive with age. I now use this product in Sensitive. It is great! Lightweight but seriously moisturizing. The SPF will be tested during the summer months, but I have faith it will hold up to the test.(Most with SPF's break me out with the first use, but not this one.)"
"Before using this product, my skin was awful. I had pimples, fine lines and wrinkles, and the overall texture was rough. Since using this product, my skin has done a 360. I have more confidence now and I don't have to worry about my skin anymore. Thank you so much Olay!"
"Thank you for making this truly unscented. I have asthma and allergies and most manufacturers cater to those who like/tolerate scent. I have been using this for several years - am in my early 60's and my skin does not look my age. I would like to see this product say, in a night cream and a firming/lifting. UNSCENTED OF COURSE.! Thanks Olay - love the unscented. Love the Complete spf15/unscented!!!"
"I have used Olay since I was a preteen. My grandmother had beautiful skin and she always used Olay. I'm 50 yrs old and have great skin, I use Olay with SPF every day, I'm a natural blond and always stay out of the sun, but like the extra protection. I get regular complements on my skin and I really don't do much or spend much. My daughter who is 24 and a nurse also uses Olay and she too has beautiful. A great product for everyone!"
"Olay complete as done wonders to my skin iam 47 but my face could not make up its mind,wrinkles or spots.I really did keep swapping creams until i did try olay,it has been 2 weeks my skin is clear of pimples and the small lines around my mouth and at the side of my eyes are fading,I am really happy thanks olay hopper"

This product is amazing. When I first started using it I had. Serious lines forming on a very dry face. Now my face is soft again and the lines not so prominent.
I have used this product for years. I was very happy when the sensitive skin formula added SPF to it several years ago. It makes my face feel smooth without feeling greasy.
I have used Olay for many years and would not give it up for anything. I am almost 51 but still have to try and convince people that I am not as young as they think I am.
It's really the best moisturizer to use. It's not greasy and it leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth. I've been using it for as long as I can remember and do not plan to switch to any other kind!
Turned all pillowcases and necklines on clothing orange within 24 hours and can not be removed. Clothes ruined. Thought it was foundation but still occurred when not using foundation.
Another great product to keep your facial skin soft and young looking.
need to apply 2 times through day .. maybe good for night time.

I've been using this product for years and it surely is worth staying loyal because I've seen the benefits to my skin!
The moisturizer is apart of my daily morning/night facial routine. I am finally content with going somewhere without dry flaky skin.
I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone. It's too think and makes your face feel oily and messy afterwards.
Good moisterizer but doesn't feel heavy on your face. Keeps my face from being too dry and protectsfrom sun while feeling like I'm wearing nothing.
"I used to use this product, i loved that it has spf in it and it seemed to work well with my skin but I'm an animal lover and when i realized that they aren't a cruelty free company i had to stop using it. I hope olay will stop testing on animals!"
Don't love this moisturizer.. left my skin feeling a little sticky and made me break out on my forehead. I have very sensitive skin and didn't use this more than like a week.
I like this moisturizer. Perfect for sensitive skin. But I dont know there's something here that really makes my mind to switch to other cream.but this is hood tho.
