Nice moisturizer and a little goes a long way. I use this along with the essence in the morning and it keeps my face hydrated all day.
"I love the moisturizing effects this serum provides. Once you get pass the feeling of slime, it mays my face feel revived and well hydrated."
I've been using Cosrx Snail essence for more than a year and started purchasing from Walmart 3 months ago. Happy to be able to purchase at a much better value with 2-day shipping. this snail essence is very thick and will make sure skin extremely moisturized throughout the day and night.
Thick essence!!! I was doubtful about the consistency when I read previous review. Happy with product! I ordered via pickup and am satisfied with my purchase!
"This is my favorite product from Cosrx. Really gentle and moisturizing, and love the texture."
I'm addicted to this texture of Cosrx Advanced Snail Essence. Feels like my skin is reborn. In love with the product. highly recommend it!
It's a nice serum feels nice on the skin I don't know if it actually helps in deep moisturizers
"I like this product in general. It's lightly hydrating without irritation. However, I don't like this one from walmart.com. I have purchased from Korean- based websites and those were a thick gel like consistency. This one was much thinner and very oily."
This came in the mail already opened. I'm hesitant to try out the product because I feel as if theres a risk of tampering. Disappointing since I was really excited to try it out.
