Have been using the Image line for a year now upon the recommendation of the esthetician I see. My skin was super dry and having lot of problems with a dermatitis where my skin would peel off my nosed. Saw a dermatologist but it wasn't until the esthetician used the Vital C line with me that my skin finally started to respond positively. The serum is a foundational piece to this line. I use the other the other Products as well
"I have been buying this item for a year now, and Walmart has the lowest price, plus free delivery. The serum keeps my skin hydrated and feeling young. The fragrance is citrussy and clean. A bonus is that, although rather pricey, I've found that Walmart has the lowest online (or retail) price."
"I have used this line for years. I was shocked to purchase at walmart, but the quality is the same for less money. I will try to purchase all from here moving forward. Walmart actually does not sell. It is a third party dealer. No issues with shipping or product."
I had a facial at a fancy high-end Salon in June they use this product on me and I bought a bottle for $85. Imagine my surprise when I found the same item on walmart.com for about a third of the price I'm very happy about this. This product helps even out the redness in my face and it smells great.
"Omg my face feels so soft and smooth, I love it so far. I've been using it twice a day for 2 weeks and I really feel like it's changing my skin."
My esthetician recomended this vit C and i head in a diferent clinc that it is the best Vt C. I use every day in the morning under my hidration and under my suncreen. Love it!
This serum moisturizes all day and all night. An ethnician I go to uses this brand in her practice. All natural and smells like oranges. Awesome results.
Wonderful product! Smoothes my skin and smells like I just cut an orange in half. Price is great for such a high-end product.
Love this serum! Get so many compliments from people who want to know what I use because my skin is so smooth and young looking.
This has been my 'go to' product for years. Smells fabulous and is the best hydration for mature skin during any season. Used to buy on Amazon but they have made it very expensive. Walmart online has the best price offered anywhere!
"Like how it feels on my face, and I can see a difference on it!"
Highly recommend this serum. My esthetician uses it too
My favorite facial cream. Scent is wonderful light citrus and makes my face feel like velvet!
"Love the sweet orange smell, light and easy to apply"
This anti-aging Serum is excellent is exactly what I got at a ritzy Day Spa
"This is not an authorized seller of Image Skin Care Products. Purchasing this, you are taking quite a gamble on whatever you are putting on your face. Good Luck."
Awesome product. As advertised and shipped promptly . Thanks
Awesome product and the cheapest at walmart! Been using for over 7 years
