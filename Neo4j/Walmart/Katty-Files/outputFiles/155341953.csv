"I've used this product a couple of times before. It always works like a charm! Previously I had tried everything from OTC products to all types of alternative treatments. I once had one cut off at the doctor and it just left a scar. This stuff is incredible, goes on super easy and leaves no scar at all! I also see they have lots of other products, I'm definitely a customer for life!"

I was amazed at how well this worked! It only took 10 days and the 3 skin tags I had around my neck area had fallen off and I can't even see a sign of any scars left behind!
"I have been using it for 1 week. Haven't noticed any change on the skin tacks yet. I'm giving it 2 stars because I still hope that it may work eventually. In the instructions is said to be patient, so I'll be."
I used the whole bottle for over a month as directed and it did not work at all. The skin tag is the same size and has not worked.
