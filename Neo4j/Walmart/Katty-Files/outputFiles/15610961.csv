I'm outside a lot and need maximum sun protection after having skin cancer twice. This product has great protection and goes on easy.
"This product is great. We were in Aruba and i had forgotten to pack my usual sun protection. I ended up buying this and was so impressed, I didn't go back to using my regular product"
I love this product! I have been using it for a year +. I wear it daily and under my makeup.
"I also use it on my arms, hands and feet."
I would not leave home without it.
"My rheumatologist recommended this product to me because I have lupus and need to stay out of the sun. During the day I use the Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen as a moisturizer, and I think my skin is smoother and moister than ever."
"Going outside to run errands, morning walk - reaching for just one tube to"
moisturize and protect my face from UV darkening. This entire New England
winter my skin has remained monotoned. and the price is affordable.
"I burn very easily and when I use this sunscreen I never burn. I work construction so I'm in the outdoors 12 to 15 hours a day, 6 days a week. I won't use anything else."
I always use this every day for my work. I am close to the light I just want to protect my skin. I love the sun block one but I can't find any where carry that. Only the sun screen only. It better with sun block than sun screen more block the sun or light. Any way it good have sun protection too.
This is my go to sunscreen and has been for over a year now. I love how it dries down (gives me a beautiful dewy glow) and it works. Plus The Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology released a study that proved there were more benefits to wearing a higher SPF (100+) and that it is not a marketing ploy. This is my ride or die.
"Had to use a sun screen protection since was young do to issues on my skin and this one is so far leave a non greasy and sticky feeling, more comfortable then any other to wear."
"How can anyone know if 110 SPF sunscreen works? I have no idea but I use it just to take extra precautions. I wanted to give excellent ratings but It's pricey, not sure if it meets SPF expectations or if it is effective. Buy it if you have a little extra money to splurge on your face tanning needs. I bought it for it's good name...Neutrogena, and I'm hoping I didn't waste my money!"
I used this product once and it felt great on my skin. It is light and dries very quickly. Not greasy at all.
"Bought to use for oily face, great for oily skin with SPF protection which is so important."
I love this sunscreen. I have very oily skin and I can wear this without looking glossy under my makeup. I don't like to expose my face to the sun and this really does the job. Yay for stopping the aging process!!
"Easy to apply, absorbs quickly, great sun protection. Use it on a daily basis."
This cream is awesome! It protects my skin and keeps it looking great!
I bought the product years ago and love it. Is very good for my sensitive skin
I'm so happy with this because is true is light oil free.
"I ude this product for more than 8 months, and I am happy whith the."
I buy this two week ago and I feel happy with the results of my skin
"Great value, non-greasy, and 110 UV!"
Excellent for summer. Not heavy. Don't forget to protect your neck as well as your face.
"Went on Caribbean cruise, had no sunburn! works great. I am typical red head with fair skin, did not want to ruin my cruise with serious burns in heat/sun of Caribbean. Would definitely recommend!"
I have been using this product for more than a year and it has been very helpful since my skin tends to be oily but with this product on my face has protected my skin from sun burn
"This is a Good Product but it makes me Sneeze and runny nose and itchy eyes. Since it is for my face, well I put it on my face and it sets off my allergies,...Maybe the Fragrance? I wish it could get this unscented. Cannot Use It Any Longer."
I have been using this and leaves my skin refreshed and soft! I would recommend to anyone who has sensitive skin it keeps my skin feeling nice and cool love the brand and its a name I can trust to keeping skin healthy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen with Broad Spectrum SPF 110 helps shield skin from sun damage while also preventing the signs of aging. For use on the face, this lightweight, sheer lotion helps maintain skin's youthful appearance and defend against sun-induced signs of premature aging, such as fine lines, wrinkles, age spots, and uneven skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this facial sunscreen! I'm very breakout prone. I love that this product is oil free and leaves a non-greasy finish. It acts as the perfect makeup base too! So excited to find this! This review was submitted as part of a paid campaign with Walmart and reviewer.
"I've been using this every time we go on beach time vacations and during the summer and while the rest of my body tans as I allow it to with minimal spf, this face lotion doesn't let any sun or color through - I love the smell, texture and results!!!"
"This product is amazing! My husband uses it to protect his dry skin (we live in dry, dry New Mexico) and it absorbs and softens his skin and helps to gradually get rid of those age spots that show up as we age. I started using sunscreen in my 20's, then regularly in my 30's and now I'm 56 and people are always thinking I'm anywhere from my mid 30's to early 40's (depending on how tired I am). Girls, please, please use sunscreen. You'll never regret it!!! Also use a high SPF if you are fair skinned like I am."
I don't like that this sunblock isn't waterproof. I only bought it because other people said it doesn't make your skin look oily but it does. It leaves a nasty film on your skin. Used it at the beach on my honeymoon and when I sweat you could see the white sunblock dripping down my face. Threw it away! Would not recommend!
"I love that this sunscreen is such a high SPF, but unfortunately that's about the only thing I love about it. I don't know if it was just the one I got, but it felt really thick and sticky on my skin. I've also only used it twice, since buying it 2 months ago, because it made me break out like crazy. It also stings really bad if it happens to get in your eyes."
"I bought this one month ago on a long car ride home because I was getting a sunburn in my car! Little did I know how this purchase would impact my beauty routine from that point on. I have worn it every day since! It has DRASTICALLY improved the appearance and feel of my skin on my face, chest and arms! The tone and overall complexion of my face has improved to the point that I am no longer wearing foundation! Neutrogena, you have made a customer for life! Thank you for the single greatest sunscreen I've ever tried."
I do feel it protects my skin. My skin looks young with and also saves me from getting tanned but... too greasy. Shows on my face and does not get absorbed. Leaves a thick layer on the screen of my phone while I am talking. Only given 3 stars because of this reason else its a good product. Neutrogena Customer Care - please pass this on and improve the greasiness of this product.
"I have been using it for more than 3 years and my skin looks much better than before. I have medical treatment for melanoma and before this it always got darker in the summer months, but not anymore. Now I can go out in the sun knowing that I am well protected."
"I was looking for ageing sunscreen and I tried neutrogena face shield sunscreen with SPF 110. But as soon as I applied it on my face, my face started burning. Specially around cheeks and chin. (I don't have any broken skin or any acne) Still I waited for 15-20 mins, thought that the burning sensation will go away in few mins. However it was the same even after 20 mins. So I had to wash my face But even after washing It the burning sensation was the same. very disappointed with the product."
I am almost 30 years old and I have been wearing Neutrogena 110+ for over 2 years.. I am always getting compliments on how great my skin looks. I would strongly recommend this product to anyone. I use it on my kids as well whenever they go outside :)
"Some say this product is too thick and it is- but it seems like the higher spf, the thicker the consistency.(So that's to be expected). With that in mind, I have very sensitive acne prone skin and I love this product. This does not make me break out at all. And strangely, even though I've read that 110 spf is not that much better than 70 or even 50, I see a noticeable difference in the marionette lines in my skin at the end of the day with this product, vs a lower spf."
"I have extremely oily skin where I would have a shiny face every 30 minutes. This is the only sunscreen I've ever tried that doesn't feel heavy on my skin, doesn't make me feel shiny, and does an outstanding job when preventing me from getting sunburns. I would definitely recommend it! <3"
"Not only does this offer amazing protection from the sun, it also acts as a superior moisturizer. It leaves your skin supple and It doesn't l leave it feeling greasy either. My dad introduced me to this product a few years ago and I have been using since. He finds it amazing as well and uses it daily. I try to always have it on hand and use it year round."
"I really wanted to give this an excellent review, but the high level of sun protection comes at a cost: it stings my face! I love the base lotion texture; it's creamy, smooths on beautifully & doesn't cause breakouts. My dermatologist recommends this brand, especially with the helioplex, but I think I will have to return to the Pure &Free products for use on my face. My husband, who has Familial Epidermal Dysplasia, will use this on the back of his neck when he is outside. In the end, I think this is great sunscreen, if your skin can tolerate it."
"I have been seeing a dermatologist for problems with my face and the doctor recommended I use 110 percent sunscreen. I have been using your product for a month and went back to her and the first thing she said was ""you have been using Neutrogena haven't you?"" And I told her yes. and she could see the difference in my skin."
"The face sunblock works but it comes off if you sweat a lot or if there is water on your face. Just make sure you apply it 15-30 before going outside. I usually apply it and then run to work 10 minutes later so maybe that is why it doesn't stay on my face as well as I would like it. Other than that, it works pretty well. I love the fact that it is not greasy."
"I do not understand why you would make a product that when placed on the forehead burns the eyes. We all know everything on the forehead migrates to the eyes.Yes, I wash my hands after applying. Does feel great on my skin but if you can't see through the tears, its worthless"
"I started using this 4 months ago. I noticed a difference in my face that week. My completion and color of my face seems to be better. What I mean is I do not break out as much and my face is not as red, I do not have to wear as much foundation on my face. I am Caucasian Female age 35 with a T-zone oily skin and I am sensitive to other face products, even Neutrogena face sunscreen (different kind tho) I feel like my face is softer and my skin is healthy when I use this product! I will continue to use this!! Happy customer!"
I recently statred using this particular sunblock.What can I say? Perfect! Not too oily is what look for in a sunblock. Yet it dosent leave my skin looking ashy and dry. I have medium brown skin and I totally recommend this sun block for everyone..Thanks Neutogena for making a highly effective sunblock :-) *
"this sunscreen has helped me a lot that words can not explain. but I have a problem, I would like to order this sunscreen but am in Africa Zambia. please is there a way you can send it to me? mostly my aunty in the uk is the one that buys and sends for me but she's not there anymore ,so please can you still send it for me? I would be so happy"
"I use this sunscreen every day, and it is so smooth, fine, and subtle once it's rubbed in that I can go with just the sunscreen on and have nice skin, or I can apply foundation on top without any kind of issue. The scent is not really noticeable, and the amount for the money is pretty good. I've used up about half the tube, maybe 2/3, in about five or six months."
I absolutely love this sunscreen. I have fair sensitive skin. I have been looking for a sunscreen that doesn't have a strong sunscreen smell. This sunscreen smells great and is not oily like most sunscreens. It also leaves my skin feeling moisturized and soft. Please do not discontinue. Best product ever.
The texture of the product is good. It is a little bit oily but it works perfectly fine with my dry skin. The only problem is that it really burns my eyes. I expected to use it around my eyes but unfortunately it is impossible due the uncomfortable watery eyes I get.
"I love this sunscreen! I have a very hard time finding products that don't irritate my face. Never fail, Neutrogena always comes through! For some reason, it took me quite some time to run across this product. It glides on smooth and non greasy. You have a life time customer with a family of four!"
"This product did not work. I applied it as instructed and my face was sunburnt. We were outside for 90 minutes, I reapplied it, and wore. Hat. My face is now sunburnt. I used the aerosol spray without any issue, but this product was a huge disappointment. I am glad I did not apply it to my kiddo."
I purchased this product a couple of days ago because I have really light skin and end up looking like a cherry tomato after a short time in the sun.I also purchased it because it is oil free. The problem is that it makes the skin on my face feel and look greasy. I hoped after a few minutes that maybe my skin would absorb it and everything would be great but it didn't happen and I don't think I would purchase this product again.
I have tried millions of sun screen living at the Jersey Shore. This by far is the best sun screen. I was very surprised how wonderful Neutrogena age shield worked. No oily feeling my face felt protected all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I live in Florida where you can get a tan all year round. You might like the way you look but if you don't wear a good sunscreen you're playing with fire! Skin cancer is not worth the risk when the strong Florida sun becomes your enemy. Surgery to remove cancerous growths is not fun plus some people die from them.
This lovely oil free product keeps you safe and is so comfortable to put on your skin. It keeps you safe and also shields your skin from the aging effects of the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"One of the highest, if not the highest, SPF light, Oil free, face Lotions I have ever used. the skin is protected with out the feel of heavy, greasy feeling from other products. If you want a light, very effective SPF, then this is the one for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's thick and pasty but that what you get when you purchase SPF 110. great product.

Put this on and spent the day outside. Blocked the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
feels light and smooth. Perfect under make up. it actually works like a primer. Makes my face feel good!
I began using this when I couldn't find the one that I orginally wanted. I will never change my facial SPF again. I have light acne and very oil skin (45 yrs) and use this daily. It leaves a matte finish and does not cause breakouts.
Worked great except the fragrance made me sick.
Why is there no fragrance free version? I had to return this product but would love to buy a save version without the chemicals used for fragrance
I will never go back to regular sunscreen...this sunscreen is so light on your skin that you can't even tell that it's on your skin.....love it....love it.....love it!
I use Neutrogena Age Shield Face Lotion 110 for two reasons: Protection against aging and burn. I have Fair skin and burn easily. This has been the best product for me and I have used it for many many years. (more than 5)
I always on a hunt with a sunscreen that doesn't hurt my skin. I.. totally have a sensitive skin. But this one doesn't hurt or irritated my face at all. I have already told my friend and family. They all loves it too !
"I was told recently at the spa that unless you are using a sunblock on your face of at least 100 that you are not being protected at the aging that the sun does. In addition, even if you are not in the sun a sunblock should be used."
Dr. recommended this to me and I'm very pleased with the results... I am out in the Florida sun all of the time and this product makes me feel safe... Thank You!!!
I have skin cancer on my head and face. I go in for treatments every 3 months and my dermatologist recommends this for use in between. It has worked great for me! I only wish it came in larger than 3 ounce tubes.
"My face is soft, not as oily, less break outs and wrinkles aren't as prominent! I put this on every morning before applying my makeup! This is a must have!!!!!"
I love Neutrogena products but I am having problems with this one. I have tried it several times-under different environments-- it always burns and runs. I don't know why- the other products are great.
"Am a soccer referee and am out on the fields for up to 6-8 hours a day on the weekends. I slather on my SPF110 and am set for the day! It's very, very effective."
I love it.
My dermatologist recommended this product years ago and I have used it since then. Never feels greasy or sticky. Seems to work really really well for me.
"I use this on my face and neck every time I go out for a hike, bike ride, or any outside activity. It is not as light as I might like, but worth it for the protection."
"Would love to be able to use this product, but burns my sensitive skin and creates a rash. Tried it for the SPF, 2 weekends in a row....Burned and caused rash both times."
This product really works. It is not greasy and rubs in well. Just remember to use enough to really cover the area. I use it on my body even though it is a face lotion sunscreen.
I ordered this and it stated Sunblock and when they sent it to me it was sunscreen!!! when you put it on it leaves a white film on your face. It seems to work alright.
"Love this product! I have super sensitive, acne prone skin & this is the only sunscreen that doesn't irritate or make my face break out! Not oily or greasy, feels weightless on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is a great lotion and sunscreen. Very effective for all types and ages of skin, and I find it very helpful even in the harshest sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this product as it does not leave a greasy feeling and does an excellent job at protection from the sun [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After using for two day's my face broke out in a rash.
I've been using this item for a couple of years
I've used this product for years .
"Very cool, and drying fast"
"This is a very good product, a bit expensive but worth it...."
Everything was exactly as I expected
"I had bought this face shield while I was holidaying in orlando, I am from Africa .. I developed severe acne and boil like pimples and my lil girl developed severe itchy rash all over, unfortunately I had purchased 5 ,hoping to give them out to relatives back home .. Will not be using it again.."

This product is a excellent protection for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great sunscreen. All Neutrogena products are great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"my dermatologist uses the same sunscreen, enough said"
the product is good because it is not greasy for my oily skin.
This is a very smooth sunblock. It goes on white and fades to you skin color rapidly. It feels like a protective layer on your skin.
"I have used the fragrance-free, oil-free Age Shield Face Lotion Sunscreen for a few years now, but I can't find it in fragrance-free any more!!"
"Just discovered that this is what makes my nose run. Pity, because this is the best facial sun block I have ever used."
"I love the lotion I do wish that it had more ""staying power"". But for the most part it goes on well and lasts better than most moisturisers."
"Not sure what the ingredient is that makes my skin feel like its burning when i put this on, but I wont buy it again."
This product is fantastic. It blocks the sun and makes you look younger. In my case you my skin is softer thanks to this product.
i sued a face gel and it helps with my skin and face to make it look better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I never really tried it but I'm recommend people to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This made my face look refreshed and not oily and did the job from keeping me burnt. A must have [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It makes skin bit dry and rough. looks like white patch after applying. Doesn't look good if you sweat. If there's any preferred way to apply the cream, please suggest."
This is a wonderful product. Stays on good and really works. Highly recommend!
"Everyone should carry this in their car or purse, not greasy and protects you."
Super thick and greasy. Sat on my skin instead of absorbing. NOT good for putting under makeup
"I use this product on my two little redheads, and this product works better than any that I have ever used. No hint of a sunburn anywhere. This product is fantastic."
I love this product
Good
"I'm glad I am not the only one. I have tried the moisturizer twice (about a year apart) and love the texture and how my skin feels, however, it makes my eyes burn too. Not only this Neutrogena moisturizer but also another one. Had to give it up and use something different and won't be trying them again."
"I've had a Melanoma (stage 3) so I use a lot of strong sunscreen. This is one of the best. However, it does have its problems. I can't apply it to upper or lower eyelids because of the burning / stinging sensation (in the eyes, not on the skin that was treated). It seems to be the fumes that cause this. I am also concerned about methylisothiozolinone and hope to see sunscreen free of it soon."
Great for the skin non greasy.... Highly recommended for middle age women and men!
Not only is it a good sun block bu it makes my skin look younger.
"i have a sensiive skin, breaks out everytime i use it!!"
It's work really nice makes your face so moisturizer and really useful for summer when you outing
If you are sitting there wondering if there is a difference between 100
"I have used other Neutrogena products with great success but this one has a ingredient that makes my eyes burn, then of course my nose runs (not helpful when outdoors. I love the way my skin feels as it is a great moisturixwe just can't wear. it."
"I applied this product as directed, went out in the sun 1 1/2 hours even wore a wide rimmed hat and my face and arms got sunburned. VERY disappointed and going to the store I bought it from and ask for my money back."
"WOC beware, this product leaves a major grey/ white film on the skin. I have a very lighter brown complexion and I literally looked grey before my run and white after my run. Not disputing the quality of the product but I cannot walk around looking like Casper. LoL"
Protects my sensitive skin from the sun. Non-greasy.
"Non greasy, works great and lasted me for awhile."
My skin is so sensitive and I felt irritation also and it is not waterproof. I may not buy it again.
I have bought Neutrogena Age Shield Face Sunscreen SPF 110 for many years. It is not greasy on my face. I usually buy this product from Ulta at a higher price point. I'm 69 yrs old.
"It gives your face protection from the harmful UV rays. No burning on my face. Though i find it a bit greasy, it's still light. I have very sensitive skin, and this doesn't irritate my skin"
"I use it mostly for the Spf, but found it to be somewhat oily in the summer, hence have little break outs. I do not wear make up often so this is my only protection against the elements and mother nature."
"Excellent product to protect your skin against the sun, my sister has recommended this product, she always use Neutrogena as Sunscreen since i th only product that works for her, I love this product is not greasy, works well under make up."
"I just wanted to write how wonderful this lotion is because it goes on smooth and protects my face from sunburn. I know it is just for the face but I put the lotion on my ears and neck as well since my baseball cap only covers so much. It is light and doesn't feel greasy. It doesn't clog my pores or cause me to breakout (I'm 48yrs) like other sunblock lotions. Also, it doesn't cause me to sweat profusely like it's sister sunblock stick Beach Defense spf 50. Thanks for making a great product Neutrogena."
is very good product and I recomend this product to everybody
Recommended by my dermatologist
Great product I used it on my granddaughter!!! It is that soft and good for outdoors
"I like it & reordered it couple of times, but think its Way Too Oily on the skin.."
I like that this goes on thick and smooths easily. It works very well for the hot hot sun. My skin doesn't burn as much.
Just used it for the first time at the beach. Not greasy and easy to apply. No burning or redness. So glad I tried it. TY Neutrogena!
This stuff works like crazy. It is VERY water/sun resistant. I only had to apply it once and it lasted all day.
"It works especially well for me. Not oily, good for summer. It went on easily didn't leave a white film. Would definitely recommend to others."
Love the product. It works and blends well and it smells amazing. It's lightweight.
Sunscreen/moisturizing lotion all in one. I use it everyday!!
my husband loves this product. He feels the difference between the other neutrogena sun screen.
it feel very light
Leaves skin sticky. Will not purchase again.
My client feedback that it was great. Thanks you..
