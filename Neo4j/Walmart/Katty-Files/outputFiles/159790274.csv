"I bought the Tea Time anti aging starter kit about 2 weeks ago and it is the best. I have sensitive skin and I have tried so many different cleansers, lotions, potions, you name it- I've tried it. There would always be something that I would have a bad reaction to. I've had no adverse skin problems with this product, and have had lots of compliments on how nice my face looks. I'm 62 and don't consider myself old at all but realized my skin needed a pick me up. Boy does it work"
"I've been using this for about a week and I am impressed with the results so far. It goes on very smooth and keeps my skin moisturized throughout the night. It is too early to tell about any anti-aging benefits, but I can surely tell about the moisture properties. The only downside is the smell - please remove the fragrance from this product."
For years I have used a more expensive product and decided to give this a try. I have been using this cream for about six weeks and had good results. I have very dry skin and this cream absorbs quickly and minimizes fine lines.
I started using this on vacation after purchasing the trial package. I love it. I noticed a difference in my skin in just a few days.
The whole line made my skin break out its also over priced for a new priduct waste of money
