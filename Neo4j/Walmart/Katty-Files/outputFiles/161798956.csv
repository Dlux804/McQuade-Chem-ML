"You can tell a overnight difference after using. My pores are tighter, skin is smoother and subtle, evenly toned, reduces blemishes, the list goes on. Highly reccomend"
"Been using about a week so far and cant believe results...skin appears so much more smooth in so little time. And don't be afraid of the "" snail"" thing - honestly, if it didnt have it in the name, I wouldnt even know it was there because it has no odor and isn't sticky or slimy at all. So glad I tried this!"
I switched over to the Mizon All In One Snail Repair Cream as my daily moisturizer. It sinks into my skin and my skin feels very moisturized afterwards.
Mizon's snail cream really works. They repair the skin and fine wrinkles and keeps the skin really moisturizing
