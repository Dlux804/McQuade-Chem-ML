"This is a repeat buy for me, I love this product. With our frigid winter temps, blowing winds, snow and below zero windchills, Here in Minnesota you need a daily moisturizer that really works and this Yes to Blueberries is the Bombdiggity."
"Based on use of other products, I began by using to much...and spent a lot of time rubbing the product in... Once I reduced the amount, it was great...absorbs completely, leaves skin soft, smooth and looking better than ever. The scent had only a hint of blueberry...but I like the fact that it is not overwhelming. I eat healthy, do yoga and exercise...so these products fit right in with my lifestyle...love them!!!"
"I am in love with YTB Daily Repair Moisturizer! Since I use the YTG CC Cream, I actually use this product at night as my night cream. It goes on smooth, doesn't clog my pores or feel heavy and I wake up feeling refreshed and some mornings-glowing! I've only been using this for a week and already I see improvement in my skin's condition."
"First time using the Yesto products. I have been very happy with this moisturizer. Smells fine, no issues with my sensitive skin at all. It's light and not overly greasy at all. I use it over the repairing serum, if you use too much moisturizer and don't let the serum set in first, then you may have some white buildup...but, it rubs right in after a bit. I got great results with just a small amount."
"I was using an expensive brand of moisurizer and just wasn't all that happy. Then I decided to try the Yes To products and let me tell you, I am absolutely sold! My skin responded positively to to the daily repair moisturizer immediately and I will never go back to any other brand. It works well with or without make-up and my face seems to glow."
Nice protective coat on face. Helped to hydrate skin after using the Yes2Blue foam cleanser. Eliminated dry patches on skin. Saw improvement almost immediately.
"I have always had sensitive skin. Now that I'm in my 50s it's almost worse. almost everything that is meant for older skin either breaks me out or makes my face dry and itchy. Thanks to Yes to Blueberries I have a moisturizer that works, no break outs, feels good even under makeup, and makes my skin feel soft again."
"My skin looks and feels amazing after nightly use, but after using it accidentally one morning i won't use it for a daily moisturizer again, it made my skin super greasy looking. it smells absolutely wonderful."
Effective packaging. One pump is the perfect amount to cover my entire face and neck. Absorbs quickly so there is no wait for the product to dry/absorb before applying make up. Instant softness and no shine when worn alone.
"It says it's an age refresh face lotion, but I bought it just because I love this brand and needed a new daily face lotion. This stuff is WONDERFUL. A little goes a long way and makes my skin feel like silk!! I also noticed a significant increase in the firmness in my skin. Will definitely be purchasing again."
I have only been using this for about two weeks and I can't believe how soft it makes my skin. I am so excited to see how my face and neck will look and feel after a month or so. I have a feeling I will be ordering this product a lot!!!! I just love the way it makes my face feel.
"This product is very moisturizing and makes you feel very refreshed, where i dont even feel the need to reapply in the morning! The smell is a tad bit different but nothing horrible and that you cant get used too! I have definately made this my only face moisturizer from now on so glad i took the chance to try it!"
"I love this product! I use it more in the summer time even though it is not the SPF type. The facial cream with SPF was too tacky and had a metallic smell. I spend alot of time outdoors and my skin just soaks this cream up and asks for more. It has a pleasant fragrance and feels light on my skin. Its is cool and refreshing on a hot summer's day. I didn't have alot of wrinkles when I started using this, but haven't developed any since."
"I can't say enough good things about this product, and the whole Blueberry line. I have been so happy with the results and feel confident using a product that is 99% natural. I use the Say Yes to Blueberries Shampoo, Conditioner, Daily Repair Moisturizer, and the Eye. I love all of them. I haven't tried any of the other lines, but LOVE the blueberry! :)"
I love the entire blueberry collection. Great scent and non-greasy texture. I was in a personal care shop yesterday in NYC. The salesman said I had beautiful skin and asked what I used. They were running a promotion for five of their products for $170.
"I love the moisturization from this product, but I am not at all a fan of the scent - it is too sweet and powdery smelling for me."
This product is so greasy! I was really looking forward to trying it & I was highly disappointed. I keep trying to use less & less to avoid the greasiness but no matter what I always have a shiny & sticky face
"I used a small amount of this moisturizer over a dab of Age Fresh Skin Repair Serum. My face feels very soft & moist. The scent dissipated quickly, so it wasn't an issue for me. Good quality & value."
"I replaced my Oil of Olay with this product, and love it. Only a teeny, tiny dot is all you need to do your whole face, and neck! Smooth it on, and it completely disappears. This container will last forever."
"My only complaint is that it tends to cake up on the skin if I use too much, and can feel sticky before makeup is applied. And it doesn't take much to be ""too much"". The plus side is that it lasts a long time."
"I am 30 and have dry, dry skin. I have used a few of Yes To Carrots products and this is my favorite moisturizer. The product's consistency is very smooth and I have found that my skin looks and feels much softer, more hydrated and firmer. I use this product in addition to the YTB Serum and Eye Serum."
this product moisturizes very well although maybe for my skin type it made it alittle oily. but def satisfied
"Really moisturizes the skin all day. Great source of Vitamin C, which Dr. Oz says is imperative in a moisturizer to reverse aging."
"I'm in love with this product, one of my many purchases of the Yes To Blueberries. I am addicted forever. Not enough space to tell how amazing and the benifits of this product."
Use the product every morning. Keeps my face from getting dry and itchy in winter. Great product and Jet's service and delivery is amazing. Will definitely order from them again.
"I use the Yes to Blueberries Daily Repairing Moisturizer for my daily moisturizer and love the way it makes my skin feel; not too greasy, not too heavy. I definitely noticed softer, smoother skin after I started using it."
"I bought this for someone who went through radiation to her face, which resulted in some very different skin tones in patches along her neck and jawline. This moisturizer is helping to even out those damaged spots."
"I just started using this product on top of the intensive serum and have noticed a major difference in my skin in 3 days. My skin is smoother, softer, and more radiant looking. I didn't even tell my boyfriend that I was trying a new product, and he told me that I looked like I was glowing! Ladies, I don't know about you, but that alone is priceless!"
"Whatever is in this product really did a number on my system. From the first day I used it, I felt ill. The second day was the same. The third day was the worst. Finally my friend asked what was I doing different, I said nothing except using this product, which we both agreed, it couldn't possibly be that? Well I stopped using it and by the third day I felt much better. Its was strange, that has never happened to me. The aroma itself is overpowering as well......"
I love the scent and it is a very light but effective moisturizer.
I am so happy that I tried this product. It is easy to apply. It feels wonderful on my skin.
I have sensitive skin and this product has worked very well for. Very light.
"Love this product, great packaging. Travels well..."
the service from Jet is always wonderful and lives up to expectations. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Nice smell not greasy does not feel heavy skin light weight. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love it and feel I can see a difference. It only takes a little bit to cover the face too. I see it lasting a long time.
Good product at a good price. Definitely don't get the one with SPF - its too chalky.
This product makes your tight facial skin feel great. It is hydrating and not irritating.
"This product smells nice, it's non greasy, absorbs well, and makes your skin soft."
My skin was immediately softer upon first application.
Love this for everyday. Light and refreshing. Non-irritating.
Love the feel and smell. It doesn't leave a greasy feel or look!
"I love this product! I used to use other Natrual creams and serums that were much more expensive. This product does the same if not a better job than the more expensive brands. It leaves your face feeling fresh and clean and not greasy. Try it, you will like it."
"This is the first moisturizer I have found that doesn't cause skin problems for me. I feel like my skin has brightened up a bit and feels more supple in the two weeks I have used it. Also it really is repairing my skins moisture balance, my skin doesn't feel so tight after I wash it anymore. I don't need very much either which is great! I hope this product stays around forever."
"I love all Yes To products and have tried many so I decided to try the Blueberry Moisturizer even though I have Acne Prone Skin. The moisturizer is too oily for my skin and irritated it after the first night. It also leaves a sticky feeling and has a sunscreen scent. I will keep using it since I bought it and its not super bad, but it is definitely not for acne prone skin."
I was first drawn to this product because of the SPF level but with a couple of uses it stole a place into my daily beauty regimen. I love it! Before buying the product I had read a lot of negative feed back about leaving white streaks but I did what some reviews said which was to shake the bottle before applying and I haven't had any troubles with it. Definite buy!
"Makes the skin nice and soft, does seem to nicely moisturize, but something in it makes my face turn red. I do have sensitive skin and hoped this would work, but due to the redness and also makes my sebaceous glands more prominent. Maybe something in it I'm allergic to is my only guess. Maybe the cucumber moisturizer will work."
"This product protects my skin, but it is so thick that even after rubbing it in, I have had people comment on the fact that I have white streaks on my skin. It feels glue-like and I am certain that all that rubbing must cause more wrinkles than it cures. I can't recommend it."
"I love the whole blueberry line, at least the things I have tried. This moisturizer is no different. It smells really good. I like my lotion, whether body or face, to smell good. And this one has an amazing scent. It goes on very easily and smooth. It left my face feeling very soft. I don't use this on a daily basis, more on special occasions. I am 22 with acne-prone, oily skin, so I need to use the tomatoes line every day. But I enjoy using their other products occasionally, like this one. It is a real treat!"
The Yes to Blueberries Repairing Moisturizer is hands-down the best moisturizer that I've found. I have dry skin and for years I've tried different moisturizers and none of them have made my skin feel as great as this one. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that has issues with dry skin! I'm sure I'll be using this moisturizer for years to come.
"This moisturizer is excellent. I love how it makes my skin look and feel. However, it seems as if I threw away a good portion of the moisturizer simply because I could not get the pump to work. Trying to smack it out through the small hole in the bottle after removing the pump cap didn't work very well either. This would be better in a simple tube."
My skin has never felt or looked as good as it does now!!
For an almost natural product this comes at an amazing price. It smells great and really moisturizes my skin.
My skin is much firmer and I even noticed a wrinkle on my forehead that has disappeared! I definitely recommend this product.
"I was bummed about this product because I used it and it felt like it never absorbed into my skin, it just sat on the surface and made my face look like I had clown make up on. Even after wearing for 12 hours."
I love this product and now because i am in the sun a lot switch between it and one with SPF. My skin begs me for this at night and in the morning I wake up feeling nice skin. I do think it has helped reduce signs of aging. A little goes a long way
I can't get the product out!!! I managed to get maybe 1/10 of a pump out of the container the first time. Smelled parfumey but not too bad. But from then on I could not for the life of me get any more product. I opened the top and it appears to be some nifty suction cup technology...or it was missing the tube that went inside. Either way I am sad.
"This moisturizer is lightweight, yet provides enough for my skin all day. I can put as much on as I want and it all gets absorbed rather quickly - no residue, no oily feelings, and no dry areas - I have combination/aging skin so sometimes it's hard to find that balance. Smells yummy and lasts a long time."
"I've gone through moisturizer after moisturizer. Finally, I have made my choice of a keeper. Yes to Blueberries Moisturizer is a refreshing product. I'm tired of trying,buying and not being satisfied. This was my first time purchasing this product and it definitely won't be my last. It's soft, hydrating,refreshing and smells great. A definite must have for the face."
"I was looking for a new product since my ""go to"" product just seemed to be lacking something and now YES to Blueberries is definitely my new ""go to"" and forever product! It's simply amazing! My skin looks and feels great. I noticed that my complexion looks brighter, younger and just full of life! It works great on fine lines and wrinkles...even expression lines! I can not go without this product!"
I love every product I've tried so far. But this product gives me one complaint... the fragrance/scent is too strong! It is not a pleasant scent for myself nor does my husband like it. Other than that keep up the good work! Can't wait to try the new grapefruit! That is my all time favorite scent/flavor/fruit!!!!
"This product smells so bad like melting plastic! It is horrible! After it is left on for a few minutes, it begins to burn. That may be a sensitivity that I have (although I have never had a sensitivity to any Burt's Bees product), but it should still be noted. It is also sticky. It doesn't really absorb into the skin and leaves your face sticky to the touch. I guess that makes it non-greasy. The worst thing is the smell!"
I love this product-please don't EVER discontinue it. I have very dry skin and typically needs heavy duty moisturizers that make me look shiny... This product gives my sensitive skin the thirst quench it needs with zero shine effect! Love love love
"The moisturizer is light, nongreasy and disappears rapidly into the skin. Visibly smooths and nourishes. It is not irritating in any way. Extremely effective."
"Not my favorite Yes To product. This mosturizer leaves a chalky white look to my skin. Will limit use to the neck area where it is not as noticable. Sorry Yes To, this one just does not work for me."
My favorite moisturizer! But I'm afraid it's discontinued by the company because I can only seem to find it online now....
This lotion works great! I was concerned because I have very sensitive skin and have had no problems with this product!
I love it but the pump quit working after only having it for two weeks.
smells bad and did not work. No positives to comment on. Would not buy again.
Is hydrating & works great in reducing wrinkles. :-)
