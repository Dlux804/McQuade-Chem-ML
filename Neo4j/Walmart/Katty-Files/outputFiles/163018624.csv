I've been using this Missha time revolutoin night repair ampoule for over a year now and still love it. It makes my skin feel so soft and helps my fine line/wrinkles as well.
"Missha Night Repair Ampoule us such a lovely product. It helps restore and repair ypur skin overnight, leaving it supple, clear, very soft and looking younger. I especially like this product in winter but use it year round, helping with hydration issues do common in winter. Its reasonably priced, works beautifully with retinoid and acid products and improves the skins texture. I wonât be without it! A definite repurchase."
"my friend recommended this product for being similar to Estee Lauder advanced night repair and it really is. great product, smells and feels great, and much cheaper than Estee Lauder. it keeps my skin mositurizing and fixed my fine lines."
