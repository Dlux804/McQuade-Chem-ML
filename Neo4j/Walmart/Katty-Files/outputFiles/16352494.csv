"Usually prefer Regenerist, but this is a great new product. Great for day or night use, smoothes out fine lines and leaves skin super soft. Absorbs quickly into skin and is not greasy. Works well under makeup (just let it soak in for a few minutes). Great for chest, neck and hands as well as face."
great product quick shipment
"I love this product. It is very fairly priced at Walmart.com and convenient to buy. It leaves my skin soft and smooth providing the ""instant fix"" the label advertises."
"I've been using this product for a number of years. I use it as a moisturizer and am quite happy with the results. It is not greasy and I think my skin looks better after I apply it. I rarely use makeup, and this seems perfect for me."
I have used it only three times under my makeup as a primer. I do see a difference when using it. My makeup stays nice on my face and it blends more even. It helps hide my pores a little. Good product and im happy with it
"I like the way this product makes my skin feel. If you're looking for a product to reduce wrinkles, this is not the product for you unless you have a life time. I've been using it for two years and my wrinkles are still there. I haven't found anything that does work the way they say it does. To be fair, I'm not willing to spend $100s of dollars either. Like I said, my skin feels silky smooth so in that respect, I like it."
This is definitely not the real thing. The real product is thick and soft and smooths over your face. The product I received is grainy like it has salt in it or something. It's a horrible feeling on your face. Buyer beware! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really LOVE this product!! You have to try it. It's so smooth feeling and really helps with wrinkles. I have a oily t-zone and this leaves me free of shine. I REALLY LOVE THIS!
"This cream is so light and satin feeling, yet you actually can watch small lines on your face disappear. Congrats Olay! This product really does make your skin soft and look younger! <3 I wish I had a boat load all to myself!"
"I wanted to like this. First time I used it, it just seemed to come off as I was rubbing it in. Kind of like it was exfoliating. I washed it off and tried again. Same thing happened. I waited a while before using again thinking maybe it was my skin going through a bad stage. Used it a few more times after weeks and same thing kept happening. It just wouldn't go on smooth. Gave it one more shot today after waiting a few months. Same issue."
I've been using this for 2 years. Never disappointed.
"I brought this a few weeks, I have notice a difference."
"This product is okay if you're just using it at night before bedtime but I find when I want to apply make-up over it in the daytime, my makeup won't go on smoothly. I've tried using less and waiting until it has absorbed completely but am not satisfied with the results. I love the smell. I have used Olay products since my 20's and I'm now 66. I have not seen any improvement in my wrinkles with this product. Will try a different Olay product."
"I received a small sample tube of this product and loved it! I purchased the full size only to be very disappointed when I could not pump out all the contents as the pump was defective and ""locked!"" I was very unsuccessful in opening the 'jar'' therefore I lost much of the product. I am willing to pay the price IF I can use the total amount of the contents. Olay....please consider packaging this product in a tube. It is an excellent moisturizer."
"I've used one 1.7 oz bottle in 16 days, with 2 applications per day. Is this normal? Pretty expensive to go through a product this quickly. Also have not seen the results you advertise after 16 days of use, Actually, I have not seen any results. I've given it adequate time. I was hopeful this was the product I was waiting for."
"I love this product -- it's the best facial skin treatment Olay offers! The packaging, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The last bottle squirted cream up and out around the base of the pump every time the pump was depressed, and now a brand-new bottle won't pump the cream out at all. I seem to recall Olay using identical packaging for a different product several years back and I had trouble with it not working, too. Please change the packaging to something that works AND displays how much is left."
"I used this product faithfully for over 2 weeks & saw zero improvement in my skin or wrinkles. The product has a pleasant smell, but left my skin feeling sticky & never seemed to fully absorb, even after a couple of hours. I would not recommend this for wear under makeup due to the stickiness. Switched to a different brand/product & am having much better luck with it."
"The product is absolutely excellent. After a few weeks the lines around my mouth are significantly reduced in appearance - and without having to have a facelift! However, the container is terrible and I am so tired of having to pound it each time I want to apply the product. When will there be a new container? Soon?"
"Had no trouble with the packaging and like the consistency of the product BUT it's totally ineffective after 3 weeks of use, morning and night. I've noticed no reduction in wrinkles, shallow or deep. I hoped they'd be at least slightly diminished, but I see no evidence of that. Disappointing."
"The only facial products that I use are Regenerist and Prox-X. For the most part, I love your products. But, some of your packaging is terrible. Especially the packaging for Regenenerist Wrinkle resolution Complex. You can waste a good bit of the product if you aren't smart. I have figured out how to take the pump bottle apart and I can get a least 10-14 days more out of the pump bottle. I WILL NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT AGAIN."
This stuff is amazing I have been using it for three months and my skin looks so good
"This product is the best that I have ever used, NEVER again will I use generic copycats,I could'nt belive how well I looked after the first time, this will be a christmas present for my sister also,Iam 54 and now I look at least44. Thank you olay."
"Well I bought this product today and was excited to give it a try. I arrived home washed my face and when I pumped the product nothing happened, it was broken. I was frustrated that I wasn't able to use the product!! Hope its worth it when I do get to use it."
"Olay - I was a daily user of Regenerist Touch of Sun with SPF. You've removed it from the line and all you're offering are more moisturizers without SPF. In your 5 step routine above, there is no SPF advised, which you know we should apply. How can you suggested 2 daytime moisturizers and not include SPF? Are you suggesting we apply 3 creams in the morning, plus eye cream, or just skip the SPF? I love the Perfecting cream, microderm and serum...but you MUST fix the daytime regenerist routine ASAP!"
"I've been using this for years and love it. I don't wear foundation, but use this to smooth out imperfections. This is how I use it - cleanse, regenerating serum, micro sculpting SPF30, then a small pea size amount (or less) of wrinkle revolution complex. I smooth over fine lines - eye area, forehead, pores at my nose. Then gently pat in. I don't apply anything on top. Within about 10 minutes, it has fully absorbed, no stickiness. Leaves my skin looking flawless!"
"I am always open to trying new products. Overall, I like the Regenerist line so I thought I would try this. I followed the directions and when I went to apply my BB cream with my brush, the 'primer' began to come off and became pasty. My make up did not go on smooth at all and in fact, I had to wash my face again because it was such a mess of clumped up primer and BB cream. I tried again, using less this time in case I used to much, and the same thing happened."

"It says it works right away, but it's been 2 and a 1/2 weeks and I haven't seen much change yet!!! It must take longer, i mean I'm no spring chicken!!! I just had a birthday and I turned 48 years young, I mean I have a few wrinkles on my forehead, not too bad though!!! I'll keep using it for a few more weeks, so wish me luck!!!"
"I love the lightweight, silky feel. Application is great when applying to my face. I just started using the Instant Fix Primer so I have not noticed any wrinkle minimizing yet, however, after applying makeup I can see a huge difference. Almost like my face has that airbrush, flawless look to it. Stress has definitely taken its toll on my face this year and I will definitely continue to use before makeup application whether or not my wrinkles diminish. :)"
The Regenerist Instant Fix Wrinkle Revolution Complex is great! I have been using it for about a month now and I love the way it feels on my skin. My make-up applies easily and my face feels so soft. I use it every day and will buy it again. Now I can eliminate some of my other moisturizers and use this one. This was definitely a wonderful find! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was looking for more than just a moisturizer & this does the job! It keeps my face youthful smooth & reduced wrinkles ! I have been a huge fan of Olay since my teens & remain a bigger fan in my 50s! This works wonders! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product and it is the one product I stay stocked up on. Apply it after your sunscreen and while it dries, apply your eye makeup. This product not only covers wrinkles but keeps my foundation on all day. Highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Anyone who works outside will tell you that weather takes it's toll on your skin. Sun and wind, no matter the season can dry out your skin. For me the most noticeable place besides my hands, is my face. Fine lines, on my forehead and around my eyes. When I tried Regenerist Instant Fix Wrinkle Revolution Complex I couldn't believe the next day how the fine lines were less visible. After a week, they were almost gone. That's pretty exciting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am 67 years old and everyone tells me I look like I'm in my 40s! I have been using Olay for over 20 years and I think this is the reason my skin still looks skin soft and firm. I will never use anything else. That's why I believe that I am a ""Forever Olay Woman"" Thank You Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product does what it says. I could actually see and feel the difference when I used it. It actually seemed to start working on me way before the time it stated on the directions. I simply love this and the results it gives and I plan to use this instead of my current product, Loreal. Thanks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product made my skin feel so smooth and after only using a few days I began to notice my fine lines and wrinkles were disappearing. I was loving the new me. My friends also noticed the difference. Love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great product that really works. I was skeptical at first but then I tried it and volar, worked. Combine other Olay products because they are fantastic. I recommended this product to a friend and she loved this product. I will continue to use this product for a life time and recommend to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"If you want a product that does want it says then Regenerist Instant Fix Wrinkle Revolution Complex is for you. It is feather light, it is crystal sheer on the skin but more importantly it works. Love it, love it, love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have bought expensive wrinkle creams but I came back to this product because it definitely works much better - my wrinkles became less noticeable with this product and I even received compliments from friends who hadn't see me in a while. It does not make sense to spend more money on products that are not more effective. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Since I have used this instant fix wrinkle, I stopped worrying how would I look later with all these ages' lines showing. It really helped me boost confidence and even y doctor couldn't believe at my age. I was flattered when she said I look 10 years or so younger than my age now. So If someone I know who have as the same predicament before, I would advise her to use Olay Regenerist Instant fix wrinkle revolutionary Comp. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has made huge differences in the lines on my face. All but the tiniest, fine lines around my eyes have been erased! It does such a great job, that I only wear foundation on special occasions. Just a little under-eye concealer after this product is all I need. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using these products now for over five years and I get many compliments on my age - I am 68 years old but could pass for 50. I don't have many wrinkles - part of this could be my genes but I do not look my age and have been told that many times. I have a class reunion coming up and I can't believe how some women look - maybe they don't care but I do. I love these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was wonderful!! My mom recommended I buy it when I was looking for a wrinkle cream. I have been using it every night for two weeks and it has reduced my fine lines. It smells and feels great!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using this product a month ago and I have circles under my eyes and I am light skinned. I love this product the anti wrinkle cream has helped with my complexion. I also love the moisturizer. I used to leave the house with make-up and now I don't have the need for it. I love how this product has made me feel years younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the results when I use this product.. I can see in a few Days the wrinkles disappearing.. The price is not bad for a product that works like this product does.. It is the best I have tried of all wrinkle creams.. So glad I started using this product.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've tried many facial wrinkle creams and this one is the best of all. I trust this product for what it says it will do. I use it everyday and it is working great for me. This is a must have for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Regenerist has outdone themselves with this revolutionary wrinkle refining product. Many have tried but few have succeeded in minimizing the appearance of wrinkles in the convenience of your home. Truly a great product that delivers what it promises. Instant fix! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I know that I am getting older and wrinkles are inevitable. This product has worked wonders in slowing down and reversing this process. Would highly recommend it to anyone who is starting to see visible signs of lines and indentions in the face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this, really works especially on wrinkles around the eyes and mouth. Makes you feel great when you know you look good. If you cannot afford to have them fixed permantly this is the next best thing and a lot less pain. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I first started to notice some wrinkles a few years ago. I have always trusted Olay products so I decided to try Regenerist Instant Fix Wrinkle Revolution Complex. I saw quick results and was very satisfied. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use the cream every night and my skin feels so silky and clean, not like the others creams that feel heavy like you have a mask on. My wrinkle lines have diminished quite drastically and my over features glow. Thanks Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product feels great on the skin and goes on smoothly. I love everything about his except the pump. I wish it were just in a tube. Otherwise, this is a great product, and I would highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"my skin seems smoother and my wrinkles around the eyes are less noticable. Luv it . I also like the regenerist night sculpting cream, the next morning my skins is more relaxed and my wrinkles and sagging skin feels firmer. Keep up the good work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am 39 years old, and I recently started using this product. It makes my face feel so smooth and soft. I even have had compliments on how my skin looks. It's only been about three months since I started using it, guess it really makes a difference. I will continue to use this and will recommend it to my friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how this product glides easily on my skin. It's lightweight and I noticed a difference within the first week of trying it! I will definitely recommend to all of my friends, family and co-workers in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Simply amazing! This product has worked for me. I'm 59 years old and have deep wrinkles. I can see the difference every day. I don't want SOFT skin, I already HAVE SOFT wrinkles! I just want them GONE - Thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the regenerist line for two weeks now and have noticed a huge improvement in my skins apperance. This primer goes on silky smooth with no greasy feel. My make up looks a lot smoother. Its worth the little extra money for better looking skin.
"This is hands down the best primer I have ever tried. The texture and feel are perfect. It tames the flakes on my chin due to retin-a. It creates a beautiful base for my makeup, and the skin beneficial ingredients are a plus, plus. I rarely write a review, but felt compelled to broadcast the good new about this Olay product."
"Today I bought the Olay regenerist primer and the Olay micro-sculpting cream moisturizer. Can I use both at the same time? I'm guessing since the first is Primer, I would use that first and then the moisturizer. Hopefully putting on the moisturizer after the Primer doesn't cancel out the primer's effect."
"I try the Regenerist Wrinkle revolution Complex for two days and was told by my daughter that my fine lines is more visible, the mouth lines and lines on the forehead are much deeper. It scared me and immediately I switched back to the Pro-X line and it's improving. I feel sticky when I apply the product, is this not good to use in winter time? or due to my skin is thin and classified as sensitive? I still have almost the whole bottle, should I give it a try again?"
I have only been using this product for 1 week and have seen a big difference in the texture of my skin. My skin is very sensitive and this product has helped calm it down. Also I have noticed my forehead wrinkles have become less prominent. My skin looks healthier and more even. I am hoping for more results as I continue to use this!
I have been a loyal user Olay products and of the regenerist line and I great expectations for this product. However the frustration of the packing ruins the experience. I have tried all of the above methods to get the creme out of the container but since I can't even open it with a can opener I just wasted my money. TWICE At first I thought I bought a bad one and bought another only to find out it was a design flaw. So who know if it works or not can't get enough of the container to find out.
"I can't even comment on this product because the packaging is so poor. I have purchased this 3 times and each time I feel that I have run out of product within 2 weeks. I couldn't believe that it would only last that long, so I pried off the top and to my surprise there was still 1/3 to 1/2 of the product still in the container! Sure you can dip your finger in and then try and get the top back on, but then you introduce air and germs and the product gets thick. Olay, please fix this. Obviously I'm not the only one having problems with this."
"Just bought a two pack of this product and anxious to try it. Well, neither pump will work. When I read through the reviews and it appears this is a common problem. I tried doing what was suggested, but nothing. How sad. How can we get beautiful when we can get the product out of the container? Help me!!"
"I bought this after my mother recommended it above and beyond the Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream. Unfortunately, for me, it didn't produce nearly the same results as the micro-sculpting cream. I, too, had packaging problems. It stopped pumping, I thought it was empty. I ripped the whole black top off to find it 3/4 full still! Continued using until empty but will stick with the tried and true micro-sculpting cream!"
"I really like this product. My skin feels so soft and smooth, however, after I used it for a few times nothing would dispense. I knew I had not used up all the product. My husband took the top off and there was over a half container left. Unless the container is changed, I probably will not purchase this product again. I have had no problem with the other Olay products containers."
"I love love love this product, but I hate the bottle. After only a week of using it I had to pop the top off because it wouldn't pump out any more lotion. I still had over half of it in there. the lotion itself is wonderful it instantly got rid of all my little wrinkles and my face is soooo soft and smooth, and no breakouts."
"This really does work but the fragrance is really strong. I have allergies and asthma and I truly cannot tolerate the smell. I only us it on my forehead and I love that it does work, but I'm going to have to return this because of the scent. It's not only Olay, but I wish all beauty products were fragrance free. Please make a fragrance free one. I'd buy that in a heartbeat!"
"I am stilll not sure how much I like this product, but I am sure how much I DO NOT like the packaging! I am on my second bottle not so much because I wanted more, but the first pump did not dispense at all. Now the second bottle worked for a few days, now, not at all. Olay, I know you can do better! I have tried the tapping and it still doesn't help. I am deciding whether to return and try again or figure out how to empty the contents into a different dispenser."
"I just purchased yesterday the Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex, so I'm not commenting yet on the product itself. I'm rating Olay's directions for opening this ""complex"" (pun intended) packaging. Follow Olay's directions, posted this morning, and you will have NO problems. Worked perfectly."
This product is so badly packed that you have to destroy the container to get to the product out and hope you have an extra jar to put it in. This happened also to the second one I purchased also so its deffective. (thought maybe I just got a bad one the first time) Oil of Olay needs to replace this product. Don't bother to purchase untill they fix they problem.
"I LOVE this cream. I bought it as a ""treat"" for myself for my 50th bd. Love Olay products. Got this home and that pump would no how, no way work! I had an empty jar which I ended up using. Had to take apart everything, and scrape out the cream into the empty jar."
"I use Age Defying Daily Renewal Cream. I have also used Ribbons Body Wash both by Olay. I am totaly shocked at what this product has done for me. I am 60+ and the wrinkles are coming. I have used these products for years now and you couldn't pay me to change. Olay is perfect. Not greasy, smelly or sticky. It is the first product that does what it says. Now both my daughters use this also. I am thinking about using your hair removal product. My girls say I am living proof that Olay is the best. Thank You Esther"
I have been using this product once a day for approximately a week and a half. I LOVE it. It goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling great. The wrinkles on my forehead are less noticeable. My only problem is with the pump on the bottle. After using this product for such a short time it is not wanting to pump anything out. I can tell there is still a lot of product left I just can't get the pump to work properly.
"This might be the best Olay product I've tried yet. It moisturizes and my skin feels and LOOKS great. I LOVE that there is no SPF in this product. I'm not sunbathing with this product; I'm just going about daily life, in and out of doors. If I want SPF, I'll use sunscreen. I know it may seem ""counterproductive"" for Olay to not put SPF in a daytime product, but I appreciate that Olay offers enough choices to allow me to wear, or not wear, SPF when using their products. Great Job, Olay!"
I guess I was hoping for a miralce but I have gone through two bottles and I have not seen any results besides maybe a drier face.
"I really like this product (Wrinkle Revolution Complex). I do wish it was a little more hydrating, but overall I like it. When can we expect the new formula mentioned in description above?"
"I love this product!!!! My skin is sensitive and it doesn't bother it one bit!! I would highly, highly recommend this product! I love how it feels, not greasy at all! Thanks, Olay!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

"I enjoy this product. It's not a miracle worker but there is much improvement, and that's always a wonderful thing! When I can look at myself in the mirror and see any improvement over what time is doing to me, I'm a happy lady."
"I just started using Regenerist. I like how it feels after it is applied.I haven't noticed a marked difference,but plan to continue use.My goal is to blend age spots and smooth out wrinkles a little bit.I will keep you posted!"
"I, too had trouble with the product dispensing. You must lift up and tear off the black tab which covers the hole. Otherwise, I didn't like the product. Felt too thick and silicone-like."
it reduces the line in 5 days considerably. and my skin is a little sensitive. there is no alcohol component too~ thinking about using it until 45 years old
"I can't get the stupid pump to work! After paying this much, it should be easy to get to the product I wish I could tell you whether or not this works, but I can't even get to the lotion to find out!"
"Obtained this product with much anticipation and excitement, but was unable to use it. I need to use this product this week, but the pump was defected and broke. Olay agreed to send a replacement but in 2-3 weeks, very disappointed."
"I tried this product because the package stated it ""instantly relaxes the appearance of wrinkles."" It does not. It does leave my skin feeling soft but when I applied it initally to only half of my face so I could see if there was an ""instant"" difference in the appearance of my skin, I was disappointed. I will continue using it till it's used up, but don't think I will buy it again."
"Regenerist Wrinkle Revolution Complex is a wonderful product. I use it in the morning, and alternate between retin-a and Micro-Scultpting cream at night. BUT OMG, the first time I used it, i actually had to break the bottle open to get to the product, then i put it together, and it the pump still wouldn't dispense. Please change the dispenser!"
