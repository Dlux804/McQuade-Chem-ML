Earth to Skin Super Greens Starter Kit is incredible. Most skin is more hydrated and look more fuller. It's smoother too. I love the fresh cucumber smell of Earth to Skin Super Greens. I love the fact it cover me in the am and pm plus eye cream all day. I often have issue with puffy eyes in the morning. The eye cream and following the direction has helped me remove the fluid under my eyes so much faster. I can't wait to buy the set and more of their products.
"I love this little starter set, it is the perfect size to try out without being committed to the full size. But I do actually like the product and will be getting the full size. It has a fresh scent and leave my skin feeling clean. I have sensitive skin and I was able to use all the products without irritating my skin. My face has never looked better."
I really like this starter set. It is the perfect size to try the products to see how I like them. I like the results from this set. My skin/face looks healthier and brighter after using the products. These products will continue to be part of my daily beauty routine.
"I love this starter kit! It has all the essentials for a great skincare regimen. All the products work very well together and are super nourishing. The are lightly scented with a clean, fresh scent. My skin looks and feels amazing. I would definitely recommend this kit and will be repurchasing."
"A very light beautiful cucumber scent, really feels like you entered a high end spa facial. This starter kit has everything you need. The day and night eye creams glide on so perfectly and evenly and your able to tap them right onto your skin without any tacky or sticky feeling. The cleanser really brightens up your skin and hydrates it, my skin doesnt look so dry and boring anymore. Great stuff here, a perfect combo pack."
"The set has a nice, mild scent of fresh cucumbers. The face wash makes a good lather when you add water to it and work it up. The 3rd step (the night moisturizer or day moisturizer) also has a lovely cucumber scent, but it goes on rather thick and oily. I was worried that it might cause my skin to break out, but it did not! After using the product for several days, my skin has a healthy, natural glow."
I love how this set works so cohesively to solve my skin care problems! The cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth. The gel cream is the perfect texture for my combination skin and gives my skin moisture without oiliness. The night cream keeps my skin moisturized and the eye cream is not too harsh as some can be. I love that it's better for my
I wasn't impressed with the cleanser. I didn't have that fresh clean feeling after washing my face that I am used to. I did really enjoy the day and night gels and the under eye cream. My face felt moisturized and soft. I will definitely be getting more of the gels and cream.
The smell of the products is amazing. I loved the cleanser & how soft my face felt after I used it. The under eye cream was also amazing my under eyes looked & felt hydrated. The day cream was the only thing I didn't really like because my face was really greasy w/ in an hour or 2. The night cream made my face looked so hydrated & refreshed by morning.
I love that you get this subtle smell of cucumber when you smell it. It literally just smells like its cooling and soft on your skin. I have very sensitive skin and it did not irritate. My skin felt amazingly soft and I am in love with the day time gel. It makes my face feel SO nice after wearing and I can wear my makeup on top of it and it does not make my face feel oily or greasy or like I have anything extra on my face at all. Love it. Would definitely recommend and would purchase in the future.
