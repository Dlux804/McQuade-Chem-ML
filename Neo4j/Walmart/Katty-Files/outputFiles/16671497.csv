"Have been using this for 1.5 years instead of a regular â€˜lotion' after showering, my skin LOVES it! It soaks right, goes on smooth."
"I have, rather had, a line on the side of my chin. It's gone. This stuff doesn't irritate my skin; it moisturizes well here in the desert. I use it both as a night cream and in the morning before I apply daily sunscreen. I've spent ten times more on products that do less and aren't kind to animals. This is my go to face and neck cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this product as a face cream for several years. It provides light moisturizing without being heavy. Just what I need in the cold, Northern winters."
"This creme is literally the ONLY lotion product we can put on my daughter's very sensitive skin. With little odor and a creme texture rather than lotion 'feel', Jason Natural Revitalizing Vitamin E 5,000 IU Creme spreads easily with small amounts. Swanson makes this product very affordable, and we are thrilled to find it available in the quantities we need. Highly recommend this product for sensitive and/or dry skin."
"i used to buy Hydranorme from La Roche Posay in France , i've been wasting so much money. i found better and cheaper with this product. Love it."
"If you have dry skin, this is a great facial or hand moisturizer. I tend to have oily skin, so I only use it at night or on my hands. The Jason Aloe Vera moisturizer is lighter weight."
"I have dry skin so I tend to go for body butters and oils. This cream is wonderful, leaves my skin feeling really soft. Also, it lasts all day"
What a great product and an exceptional price!! Love how my skin feels...cream is unscented and smooth!
"It is rich in Vitamin E, that is so healing, and it lasts oh and it is a Jason product.........I trust that name."
We've used this for several years and love the softness of our faces. I highly recommend this cream.
I use this product as a night cream and it is a great moisturizer especially during dry winter months. It keeps my skin looking great!
"Very hydrating to skin, gives it a very soft supple feel."
"My husband and I are both happy with this cream, and we are on our second jar."
