"I was troubled with dark spots this last summer. I was barely in the sun, but it was affecting my skin greatly. Before use, I had red blotchy skin all over my face, as well as darkened spots. I began using Ponds B3 in July and I saw results within three weeks. The bottom picture was my before in July 2017, and the top picture is today in October 2017. I highly recommend this cream. The spots you see below in my October picture are my original freckles:)"
"I've been using this cream Aclarant B3 for 2 weeks. My dermatologist recommend to use vitamin C in the morning, and another expensive cream in the night. Before to buy the other expensive cream I went to grocery store and I saw this cream. It really works. I will try to put another picture 1 month to see how looks my dark spots. Thank you!"
I have never used this product before but have tried others. They've left my face feeling a bit greasy. The Ponds absorbs beautifully and leaves my face feeling smooth.
Good
"Ive been using this for a little more than 6 weeks. At least once a day. I have seen such an inprovement in my skin texture, brightness and even oil production. My face is nowhere as oily as it used to be. I have less breakouts and my dark spots are even lighter. The stubborns ones are still around but for the most part my skin looks so much brighter. Buy it"
"I bought this to try and help my very dry/red cheeks. It worked so well, I'm so happy with the results! My cheeks are still a little red but they are just as soft as the rest of my face. I have very sensitive skin on my face and I haven't had any negative effects."
"Was skeptical but thought I'd give it a try. Says it takes 4 weeks, but after 2 weeks the age spots on my face are fading. I use this twice a day per instructions."
"I have struggled with acne for years. I have tried so many lotions that just make your face greasy or don't even hydrate it! (Especially when using harsh acne products) This is non-greasy, the most hydrating product i've tried (lasts all day) and does what it says, not only have my acne marks faded but so have my freckles and I no longer break out like I use to! My husband even steals this from me every morning after he shaves! VERY good for sensitive or normal skin"
About a year ago I started breaking out like crazy all over my face & I would pop & squeeze resulting in red marks & scars that I desperately wanted to get rid of. I bought this after my friend told me she used this & now I use this every night bc It helped clear up my scars & redness & my skin has an even tone now. I love how it smells & it doesn't leave me greasy or make me produce more oil & it doesn't break me out either. I got amazing results in just one month! 
I love this product so much! it really helps fade my acne marks. I use this on my face and my back and its amazing. I have tried the one for dry to normal skin and they have different consistencies. That one left my sking greasy afterwards and this one leaves it perfectly matte and i do not get as oily throughout the day.
"For the price, I really like this lotion. I use it primarily for dark spots on my hands, and although it doesn't completely remove them, (so far), the spots do fade. I love the smell as well, and really like how soft it makes my hands feel. Also use it on my throat to tighten that area a bit. Non-greasy and blends in well and quickly."
"I have always been a Pond's user because I like their products so when I saw this after I saw a light brown spot appearing on my face, I decided to try it.........have been using it for three weeks and I do see some results....not quite gone yet BUT GOING......yay....Highly recommend...."
I have Oily T-Zone skin and wanted to try this Dark Spot cream to help diminish acne scars! I have been using for 3 nights and every morning I wake up I have puffy and swollen eyes. My acne scars have improved but my eye area is reacting very negatively to this cream. I would say do not put this all over your face like a moisturizer. Only put in areas with Dark Spots. For me that would be my cheeks and forhead. Do not put around your lips or eyes!
I have only used this cream for a couple of days in the morning and at night. The texture is very smooth and creamy which is great. It also smells really nice BUT it is strong. Strong perfume odors give me migraines and the scent of this is very powerful. It also seems to be breaking my face out. Unfortunately I'm not going to be able to use this on my face but I will probably use it elsewhere since it seems to be a great moisturizer.
"I have been using Pond's Clarant B3 Dark Spot correcting cream for two weeks. I have many dark spots on my face that I get as I age. I have noticed that my dark spots are less noticeable the more I use this product. This isn't greasy and the cream is super light with a light scent. I will continue to use this as its making my skin tone look so much better.I tested POND'S products for free, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this for over a year, and I can tell you it really works! I had acne in my past years, which left me redness and scars on my face. I used this cream day & night and it remove most redness and scars you can't really see them anymore. I really recommend it!"
Cream is very light no smell and gives instant result I have sensitive skin this is a God send for me used twice my face look and feel soooooo good try other creams broke me out first use not pond's I thank God was shame of spots and dried looking face this was my prayer answered it's the best!!!!
"Fades dark spots FAST. I found a travel size for a few bucks and decided to try it, I had nothing to lose as I just got over a bad breakout and had many dark spots to prove it. I could start telling a difference in about 2 days. The smaller dark spots are almost gone and the bigger ones are fading every day between this and exfoliating twice a week. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
Everything good I am satisfied thx!!
I am a true believer in reviews and let me tell you this product works I have dark patches on my face and after a short while of using they're already fading will forever buy it
I've been using this product for about 10 years under my make up and even the days I go out and don't feel like wearing any. Perfect give your face a nice matte look esp with no make up!!!
I have been battling hormonal ance in my T-zone for months I used this product once and already saw major improvement ...I also have very sensitive skin so I would say it was a Great Buy ! And it has a nice aroma !!
"I love this moisturizer, I've been using it for many years now. It moisturizes well and even makes my pores look smaller. The only thing I wish Ponds would do is to change the packaging to a plastic free container or use recycled plastic."
"Finally an affordable skin care product that REALLY works. Have been using this for 2 weeks, morning and night and have ALREADY seen an improvement in my face. Dark spots are fading and wrinkles are disappearing. Thank you!"
I have been using this product for a little over three months. Ponds has cleared up my face from blemishes and oily face. I'm very pleased with my skin and what this product has done for me. I will continue to use this daily
My sister got me started using this and I love it. I have noticed within 3 weeks the few little spots I had on my face as well as the dark circles under my eyes have started to fade. I can see a major difference with this product. I use every night and morning and will continue to use Pond's for my skin..LOVE IT
"Not sure how I really feel about it. The price is too high for the amount of product. It has a nice smell. I know it's supposed to be for oily skin but it kind of has little moisture. If the price was lower for the amount given, I would like it. I bought the other ponds in the blue"
"I tried this creme based on reviews. I had some discoloration around edge of face not too bad, but it's gone now. I have some sun damage sots on cheeks and they have lightened up and on the top of cheek just under eye. That is almost gone. The spot that bothered me most was darkness in the crease of one eyelid. I like wearing makeup but it looks a little off because of the darkness. Today i noticed both eyelids look the same!"
I have used this cream once a day maybe 5 times a week for about 6 years and I absolutely love it. It keeps my skin tone even and youthful looking. I don't wear make up on a daily basis and I get compliments on my skin all the time. I am currently 37 years old.

"This is my first time trying this product; however, I am very familiar with Pond's products. My grandmother used to use the facial moisturizers and creams a lot. I took the two week challenge and I can tell a tremendous difference. I had a few dark spots that are barely visible. My skin is looking a lot clearer and healthier. The cream is very moisturizing and I love the scent. I received this product for free and my opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using Rejuveness together with Clarant B3 for two weeks now and I couldn't be happier! My skin feels and looks softer. The appearance of fine lines has deminished and so have my dark spots. I'm very pleased after only two weeks and can't to see my results after another two! I am so happy to have received the products free from Influenster to test because I am definitely keep these in my medicine cabinet :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this product to try and lighten the dark spots on my inner thighs from rubbing and it has worked so amazing!!! I also have bad stretch marks from my pregnancy on my stomach so i decided what the heck I'll put it on that too and see what happens and O.M.G!! it hasn't been a full week and i see such a difference it is amazing!!
Nice
"I had stubborn brown (hyperpigmentation) that I could not get rid of for 4 yrs. I tried every expensive product that was recommended, I even had a light acid face peal done by a doctor, even was prescribed a retinol/hydroquinone compound cream & everything actually made it worse. This was the only thing that finally worked! I use it morning and night use a hat and shades when outdoors. By the time I finished one jar my brown spot was 90% gone!"
Works very well. Faded the sun damage on my shoulders in only a couple months of continuous use. No odor.
Dried my skin but did see a difference in just acouple of days i use it with a moisturizer and seems to work for me
"After only three days I see a difference! Affordable, too. Very pleased."
I've tried every kind of dark spot removal cream with no results. This actually works. And it smells great!
"I have been using Ponds Clarant B3 for months now and I have not seen any difference yet, very disappointed."
Product feels nice on the skin. For me the only negative is that it has fragrance. I wish there was a fragrance free one.
"i havent tried this product long enough to notice the reduce in dark spots, but this product saved my life from my oily skin..... immediately after i put it on i notice how different my skin feels and its amazing!!! im in love with this product"
I am a member of Influenster. I received this product for free to test and review. All opinions are my own. This is working pretty good on my skin. I have some light dark spotting in the middle of my forehead and on my outer cheeks. It's been about a week of me using this and my spots are starting to look a little lighter. I know I'll keep using this to keep my dark spots at bay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for the past 3 weeks, and it is pretty good. There are a few dark spots that I am concerned with, and so far I haven't noticed a huge difference in those, but overall I like how it makes my skin feel. I will continue to use this product, and maybe I will start to see results. I received this product complimentary for testing products. My opinions about expressed are based on my testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recently purchased in hopes that this would help even out my skin. I pushed myself to use it for a full week and now I'm fighting to clear up my skin, it caused me to break out horribly across my forehead. I stopped using since the breakout happened and it caused my skin to become more oily than it was before along with making my face a little itchy. Hopefully, others will have better luck and I will continue my search."
I have been battling to get rid of my acne scars. And I was very nervous to try this because I didn't want this to break me out. & I'm so happy I tryed this!!!! It really did lighten/even out my complexion and is fading my acne scars! The smell is great. I also like how it doesn't leave my face sticky or oily. Did I mention the texture! It's so whipped/creamy it blends like a dream come true. Everyone should give this a try. It's awesome stuff.
"I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. My opinions are my own. I have been using the Pond's Clarant B3 Dark Spot Correcting Cream for just over two weeks now. I love the way my skin feels and it definitely looks softer. After two weeks, though, I'm not sure it's helped any with my dark spots. I'm going to continue to use it in hopes that it will help, though, but if not then at least I have soft skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recently took the 2 week challenge and I have to say that after using this product twice a day for about a week, my face broke out like I was a teenager again so I discontinued using it. It was unfortunate because I really liked the scent and it was so light and soaked right in that I was a little sad. I received this product for free to use and in return to provide a review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recommend is very good, I love this cream is the best..."
"I started using this because a friend told me, my skin used to look dirty and oily, and now it looks really clean, uniform, it's soft and not oily."
This does fades dark spots i have very oily skin n this is not grease i put it at night cuz dont have SPF even my bro likes it
"I really love this product. I use Normal to Oily. It works perfect on my combination to oily skin. I do have dark spots and they look lighter each day, Thanks Pond's"
"I received this product from Influenster to try for 2 weeks along with another Pond's product. This one I liked very much! I noticed right away that it smelled really good! It was moisturizing just enough for my oily skin. Unfortunately, I had to stop using it as it irritated my eyes by the end of the day. I recommend others to try it, though!"
"I found this in the travel section of my neighborhood drug store, so I bought 2 to make sure I had enough to have a proper ""Before"" and ""After."" Both my grandmothers used Ponds and looked amazing all their lives. Also several aunts with beautiful skin swear by it. I've tried super expensive to regular, and this is the best. Love the light scent, have sensitive skin & no problem w/ this!"
"I have been using this cream since February 24, It has been a couple of days over a month and we can all see the difference in my skin. I had a number of dark spots from sun and acne, i still have them but the cream has helped a lot. I missed a couple of days and maybe 2 or 3 nights. But overall i was good putting the cream on twice a day."
"This stuff is amazing! I have only been using it for a little over 2 weeks now and I am already seeing a different. My skin looks more even and I have several dark spots that have been on my face for a long time that are finally starting to fade. YES! I would recommend this stuff is you are suffering from past acne scars, sun or age spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My Skin is brighter! The skin tone is more even and some darker freckles faded a little bit I find this cream to be very hydrating and I am loving it on my sensitive skin. I apply this morning and night This has even helped with the dark circles! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this cream for a couple of weeks and enjoying it as a night time moisturizer. It has a pretty smell and the consistency is super thick, making it nice to put on after my serum. I received a jar free from Influenster in order to test it out. I will continue to use it in my nightly routine as I enjoy using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product cover well and has a great feel and fragrance. I am still not convinced that my wrinkles have diminished but I can say that my face is not any worse off than when I began this journey two weeks ago. I tested the product for free but the opinions shared are my own.
My skin is in love. This has really helped with my skin tone and redness. A little bit does my whole face so it really lasts. I couldn't be happier with the results of the #seeforyourself challenge and thanks to Influenster I was able to do to complimentary. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Honestly the smell of this product prevents me from using it. Ponds- please make it scent free!!!
this is the best for hyper pigmentation. Best for acne scars [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It Helped get rid of my acne scars and dark spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this every morning and again before I go to sleep and my dark spots from acne on my face and chest have almost completely lightened up after a month. And the bags under my eyes have gone from a dark bruise color to barley even noticeable.
"I was using a very expensive facial product for my skin for about two weeks, and there wants much change. Literally TWO DAYS of using ponds dark spot correcting cream and my face is looking better than ever!"
"I absolutely love this product! I have been using it about 5 weeks now (Twice a day and Sticky if you ware under make-up). It has evened my skin tone, lightened my dark spots and reduced my dark circle. I highly recommend this product!"
I'm oily/acne prone and I use it every night for my scaring and discoloration. This product along with my routine cleansing has always been working for my skin without adding acne break outs. Definitely the results are there with continuous use.
"I first started trying this product on the top of my hands and I have noticed that the age spots are fading, now I am going to start using it on my face, I may use the dark spot correcting cream in the morning and use the dry skin cream at night."
"I tried this product and I loved it! Not only did it get rid of my dark spots, it did it overnight! Lasts a while, so I will keep buying this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It is great to use in conjunction with my Rejuveness and helps my skin look a bit younger and less wrinkles  [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have a new favorite product! Simply it works without leaving my face feeling greasy! It is light and refreshing! I use it morning and night with great results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This help my oily skin to look and feel less oily. It feels great. I tested POND'S products for free, but all my opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product made my face breakout and i had to stop in 3 days. Since it states hypoallergenic i believed it wouldn't cause any reaction. Well, wow unto me!!! Now i have to figure out how to deal with the new blemishes. Was on sale for $7, but i still feel my money went down the drain. If someone has a face that doesn't react easily then i guess it would work."
"I received Clarant B3 as a free sample from Influenster. It's a nice light moisurizer that smells wonderful, not too strong. I love the softness of my skin after using it for a few weeks. As a dark spot corrector it works on larger age spots, on smaller sun spots and freckles, not so much. So I wouldn't rate it as highly for that. The vitamin C keeps my skin looking young and fresh! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Received this product in my Influenster Voxbox. Excellent addition to my day/night routine. I have normal skin and it is very moisturizing. Scent is so soothing. Looking forward to seeing long term effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It helps brighten up your skin if u have any marks
I have just been using it twice a day for a week so I can't tell yet. Let's see how another week wii do.
I apply on my face and neck every morning & night after washing my face and I still have dark spots and uneven skin tone.
"I have struggled my whole life with spots on my hands and face, this cream has managed to clear them up within a month of using"
"I just started using this, so I don't know if eliminates dark spots. However, I love how smooth and soft it makes your skin feel. I just may change from the one I usually use. I like it."
Better than moisturizers that cost considerably more.
I have used this every day twice a day for over two months and have not seen any change or benefit from the product.
This definitely works. I have been using this for about a month & my acne marks are already lightened up. Will purchase this again & again.
"I did an allergic reaction and I had to go to see a dermatologist. It's the worst hydration cream, my skin feeled drier than ever."
this is great cream i used it only........i will recomend you to try this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
