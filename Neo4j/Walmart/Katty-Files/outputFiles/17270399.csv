I have used Microdermabrasion System Puff for over 10 years. My skin is super sensitive and the Puffs are the only thing I use to keep my face smooth and super clean. My wife loves my soft skin and people think I am 30 years younger than I really am. Thanks Neutrogena.
I got the microdermabrasion system at Walmart for the price this is a terrific product. I had a problem with my makeup looking flaky and knew i needed a good cleanser but my skin is sensitive. I read the reviews and thought I'd give it a shot. This product is great on my skin leaves yours skin so soft and feeling good. It does improve the overall appearance of your skin and my makeup looks much better. Cannot afford a dermatologist this is the next best thing. I use it every other day. Thumbs up.
"I had purchased the Microdermabrasion Kit for myself and really love how my skin looks and feels! It's amazing! My husband compliments me all the time about the condition of my skin. It's helped reduce the fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes, so I purchased a second kit for my 47 year old daughter, along with the extra puff refills. I think she's going to love this as much as I do! Thanks, Neutrogena, for an excellent product!"
"I absolutely love these. I chose not to purchase the appliance that is recommended for these. Instead I rely upon my own manual power for scrubbing my face and I don't see how the results could be any better. I am very pleased with the smoothness they leave and the feeling of being truly clean. It is a good idea to follow general directions for pattern of use.......... more use, I'm sure would be not good for the skin.... after all it does buff the facial tissues."
"I have been using them for years and my skin is smooth after using. They help remove my weekly mud mask, and remove dead skin cels."
"Ever since I bought my first microdermabrasion kit I've like the results, but I could not find the puff refills any where until your web site."
"I absolutely love the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion Cleansing Kit. They do a really nice job of deep cleaning and make my face look firmer and smooth. I have a hard time finding the refills in the stores, so I get these on-line when I can."
This is a great facial cleansing system for people like me with sensitive skin...using it a few times a week makes it effective and prevents my skin from drying out...wonderful product and great price!
Bought the brush last year and I love it. The puffs has just enough cleanser in it and smells nice. I couldn't find the puffs at the store so I had to get them on line.
"This is an easy & clean way to exfoliate facial skin to over turn and reveal new skin cells. It's easier and cleaner then using scrubs. I think it does a great job if you don't use it to often. At first, I used it 3 or 4 times a week. Now I find once a week is plenty and also cost saving. Just think these refill puffs are costly....so I don't buy to often. But, all in all I like it better than using scrubs."
My skin is smoother than ever after only a few short weeks!
Highly recommended and needed to maintain good skin care.
I have been using this product for awhile and I love it.
"I also bought the machine that these puffs are used on and it is wonderful..already in less than a week I can see a huge difference in my skin and the texture is great, smooth and not so harsh looking..Glowing would be a good way to describe it."
"These pads for my microdermabrasion brush head. I love it because it keeps my face so clean. The set came with a months supply. However, this came with a 2 months supply and the plastic part that clips on the machine head to hold the sponge on. Just as good as proactive in my book and way cheaper!"
A little pricey but what do you do? Not too rough.
I recently purchased these and it doesn't make the foam like it use to.
I cannot live without this product anymore . I use it once a week . It makes my face shiny and cleanly . It scrubs the skin and removes dead cells .
"Works fabulously! I mostly use it at night, this way the natural oils in my face have time to come back. In the morning I just wash my face with cool water. Boom! I look like a million bucks!"
"This product actually lives up to it's claim. Cleanses, softens, reduces fine lines and get rids of enlarged pores. When you are done you know your skin is clean. You feel it and your face actually glows. This is one product that won't end up not getting used because it fails to live up to expectations... It feels great!It works! Mine was a gift and now I need refill pads and they are reasonably priced. I can get great skin and still have money to eat!"
"I could not find these pads anywhere and I'm so glad I could get them online...PLEASE do not stop making these. I know products/lines need to change so there's always something ""new"", but once you find something amazing like this for your skin you want to stick with it. I haven't found anything to compare with the results I get from using this product, my skin feels smooth and silky. Love this product!"
I am so so so happy that you brought this product back. It use to be called the Healthy Skin Rejuvenator. This is the best product I have ever tried. I was so elated I brought 10 boxes of the pads in case it ever gets discontinued!! Thank you... Angela
"This is by far my favorite product on the market for home use. I am blown away at how my skin looks when I do not use it, dry and aged, but when I use this product I instantly see the difference. I purchased two replacement packs so that I would not ever run out. Great for vacationa as well to combat the harsh breakouts after sun exposure. Love this product."
"Ok, This is the first time I write a review for something I buy, really this is such great product, my pores get clogged easily after the second use I've noticed much smoother skin and my pores are less noticeable, this is a whole two month supply which is wonderful"
"The cleanser that is in these pads make me break out. :-( I wish they didn't have cleanser pre-added. For now, I am rinsing the cleanser out and then using my own cleanser with it. I love the machine these are made for, but I hate that the pads have cleanser already in them."
"For a few years I have contemplated microdermabrasion but I always thought it was too expensive. I saw the proyduct on Dr Oz and I purchased it, then I was completely blown away. After the first use I was so surprised and excited I tried it on my sister and then we tried it on our mother, immediately you could see a difference. I'm buying them as gifts for mother's day. Since I have been using it I feel great, I can't wait until my next session. I already recommended it to my co-worker. Great product!!!"
"I'm sooo glad that I finally found them, I've been going store after store looking for them. I've used this for years and my face was fresh looking and tight always until they discontinued it months ago, I was sad about aging overnight, and just today I was researching for laser or something else to get my young look again, I came across to this site, bought them today and I can;t wait to see my happy looking face after using it. Thank you so much."
This is better than what professional do I love it
Price is reasonable and results are visible. I actually used one 2x's before my refill arrived. Def recommend.
Love this product. Leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. Skin is looking smooth. I feel so refreshed
been using this product for years and love it. really cleans deep into the pores and has really helped my complexion.
"I had some trouble with ruff red cheeks and using this gently helped a great deal were face scrubs just made it worse! Just don't go over board, especially at first. Start on low speed, short times and wait at least a day or two between treatments."
I also had the problem of locating the pad refills and was concerned that it is being discontinued. I use this scrubber often and I agree it does all that it claimed and more. Love touching my skin after using. It feels so soft for days after.
"I wish the Puffs were still available in stores. This product works well. My skill always looks great right after I use it. It's perfect for wrinkles, large pores and lifting out dirt and oil."
"Was hesitant about using this product, however, had done similar procedures in the doctors office. After a couple of times, my skin felt great. I use the product 2 or 3 days a week and I love the results."
I thought I had discarded wand & was elated to find it after a move 11 months ago. I went the same day to buy the pads & am elated with how my skin is so smooth & glowing! What a fantastic product and terrific value!
I have been using this for a few years now and love it. I use it once a week to deep clean my face. My skin feels softer and the wrinkles are less noticable.
"This product is amazing! It is the best anti-aging product I've tried. Believe me I've tried alot. Soft skin, reduced wrinkles, and firms skin. IT REALLY WORKS WOMEN!"
i was the review on tv show and i wanted to try it and it is really good.. after one use i can see my skin is really soft and takes all dead skin away.. love this prouct
"Please keep making this product. I love what this system does for my skin. I have not seen the machine or these refills in stores for months, despite many efforts to replace the pads. This is a great product."
I just purchased this product and used it for the first time last night. I was very surprised how smooth my skin felt after just the first use. Hopefully looking forward to getting rid of a couple of age spots and blemishes.
"I bought this item with a little skepticism, but after receiving it and using it a few times, I found it really works well! It is doing wonders on the sun damage I have on my face...I would definitely recommend this item so far."
The old product was much more effective then these individual pads. More expensive
This product is amazing!!!
This product is so amazing. I was reluctant to try it but it is worth every penny and super affordable. I use it three times a week and have been for a month. I have already seen results and was impressed to see results after the first use. I will continue using this because not only have I seen results but so have my friends.
Good product! I use this just holding it in my hand and scrub away! It works great! Don't need the expensive scrubber!
I have gotten more complements on my radiant skin since I have started using this product. My skin is so soft.
I have used these microdermabrasion puffs for two years three times a week love how they make my skin look and feel.
I really like my microdermabrasion system. My pores are reduced and my skin looks new again. And the refills are affordable.
Please do not ever get rid of this product! I have tried many things and I love the way this product makes my skin so soft!
No other product works as good. Makes my face soft and buffs off all my dead skin and it is a great price.
"Excellent product - disappeared for a while and glad it is back, with regular use you will see fabulous results."
"Ive only had this about 2 weeks now, and I instantly had smoother skin, and after about 3 uses I noticed my pores and black heads are going away."
I was looking for this replacement and I couldn't find it on store. So I am very happy with this product and result of using it.
I really love this product. The circular actions the microdermabrasion makes my skin all glowing and tingling.
"This is one of my favorite neutrogena product. My skin feels smooth , clean and refresh after every use."
"I love these scrubbies. They do a great job of getting all the oil, dirt and dead skin off my face and leaving it smooth and clean."
"I adore this product and have been using for many years. It was discontinued in Canada, and I now have to go through an arduous process of having it shipped to a US address and then getting it."
"I was so happy to be able to get this product online. It is, unfortunately, no longer available at any local retailer. Thank for making it available! I love the way my skin feels/looks after using the puffs"
very nice
I have used the Microdermabrasion by Neutrogena successfully for years and just needed a refill .
There are products out there much more expensive but still not as good as Neutrogena.
"I love how this microdermabrasion system's puffs polish my skin and give it a youthful, firm glow."
Quick easy and love the results. So simple to use.
After one use could see a huge difference. Love this product!
This is an excellent product! It really makes me look good again!
My skin feels smooth and deep cleaned. A fresh face!
The microdermabrasion machine and pads do a good job when used several days a week.
Put one of these on your face. Its wonderful. It beat all the other products. I.m 61
Very useful as an exfoliator without the device which I found very strong
I liked that I was able to find these after looking everywhere for them!
I like the way I can get dead shin off using exfoliating puff. Good price.
I love it wish i had been tryed it. Make my face feel so clean after one time need more time to see if it do the rest.
it seems be the ony thing working for my face right now so i cant complain.
I am having trouble finding these in the stores lately is there a problem?
I used these once a week to remove dead skin. I use it without the attachment
this product match my skin very much. I love it . I will purchase again.
I highly recommend this product-only wished that you could buy them in store rather than ordering them.
have been using for a while now. Face feels soft and smmoth after using. Only negative is the refills are hard to find everyone has droppped product for wave. finally found online.
Love it works well.
Has really cleaned my pores and softened my skin
This product works just how it is supposed to work.
"Excruciating a pain to deal with would really to see the old product ""wave pads"" in the pink box come back"
