"I've only been using it for one week, but love it! I love the way my skin feels afterwards. on the first treatment, I could see all the dirt and debris coming off my skin."
I have used this microdermabrasion for years. I dropped and broke it. Went shopping for an other. Tried several stores with out luck finally went on line. Great idea! I could not be happier. Hated the shipping cost however!
Thank you Pat
"Only been using for approx. 1 week; my skin is softer, my skin has cleared up, and lines appear less pronounced. I follow up with oil-free nite moisturizer every nite. I think this proves the point that just your fingertips and a facial cleanser may not be all that you need to correctly clean your skin sometimes. I am not using every night since I have sensitive skin but using every 2 nites. I have been a Neutrogena girl for several years as it's one of the few lines that doesn't irritate my skin."
"This works just a well as dermaplaning at my plastic sergeons office. When I wash and rinse my face after, my hands just seem to slip down my face. Smooth as baby skin. One word of advice, DON'T use on the high speed. My skin peeled and was irritated for several days."
"I've used this product 3 times so far and it works great, my skin feels so soft and clean. I have dry flaky skin most of the time and it took off all the flaky skin. Works better than any other devices or scrubs. Can't wait to see long term results."
Best investment in a long time. My skin looks amazing.
I have been using the neutrogena system for the past week. (4th time this morning). It makes my skin feel so soft. I am definitely seeing a difference in the size of my pores. I highly recommend using it ! :)
I have sensitive skin and I found this product was gentle on my skin. I have used it twice and so far I am happy with the product. The end result on my skin is a nice pinky glow and smooth texture. I hope over time some of the fine lines with subside.
"I was skeptical at first about this product but after the first use, there was a notable change to my face. I would recommend this to anyone plus the price was a bargain."
I like the way this system makes my face feel and look after using. I definitely notice a different in my appearance since using. I'm in my 30s so My main goal is to have youthful looking skin as long as I can!
I have used this product for about 10 years and it finally gave up. So I bought another one to replace it. I love it. It exfoliates your skin. My skin looks alive and pink.
I've used it twice so far and I love it! Clears up my acne and leaves my skin SO soft. It does leave my skin a bit dry so I follow it with a good moisturizer.
This is my second one as the first one has stopped working after three years of almost daily use. I love this little jewel. It makes may skin feel so smooth. I hope they continue with this one.
"I have been using this for a week I really am so thankful I did I take a warm to hot shower and let my pores on my face open up, I follow up with the black head strips then after I use this machine which leaves my skin so fresh and clean I struggled with acne and scars so I followed up with the cream Diffiren I believe that is how you spell it but it has helped clear my skin ! I am excited to share with everyone my experience and feel better about my face"
"This product is way more than I expected. I was totally happy with my purchase, makes your skin feel very soft. I would highly recommend it."
I used it as soon as I received it and couldn't believe how soft my skin was afterward. I am going to use it 2x per week from now on.
"This product is awesome, I instantly noticed softer smoother skin; it also visibly removed fine lines on my face"
I have purchased this for myself and like it so much I bought one for my daughter. It cleans my face and gives it a really nice glow. And you can't argue the price. For a great product that does exactly what it says it will I have no complaint.
"This machine has changed my skin overall better and more radiant then any other high end product! I still can't believe it, but it makes my skin glow, soft and the beat part I havent had one breakout or pimple in years! This product is amazing and affordable! Thanks Neutrogena!"
"I bought one for myself and liked it so much I bought one for my daughter, too."
The microderm system is easy to use and it mskes my skin feel so soft.
I've been using this for ten years and love it. It keeps my skin smooth.
Great product that works like the most expensive one in the market.
Was excited to buy this but the spinning motion vibration is so strong that it is uncomfortable to use.
Love this product!!! The price is amazing. A coworker recommend this product to me and I love it!! Skin is softer than a baby's skin after use!!!
I'm still on the fence with this product. I have really oily skin but it made my face really dry that when I put my foundation on all my dry skin was showing. I'm going to try different ways to use it to see if it gets better. This happened using it twice a week at night then right after putting my anti aging products on. Next time I'm going to use only a moisturizer afterwards see if that works better and maybe only once a week instead.
Absolutely loved adding this product to my face wash routine. I have had it for a few months now and my skin has never felt better. However it seems water/moister is seeping into the battery compartment. I cleaned it out once after I noticed stalling when powered on and it was fine. However a free weeks later it seems to be having the same problem and this time I can't get it to work again I'm so sad.
"Noticeable improvement on first use! I went a little overboard on 2nd use especially near eyes which caused some minor irritation and redness, so use caution and don't get over-zealous. Abrader and pads are easy to use. Start on low setting. High actually disoriented me at first on my sinuses. Using with Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Retinol Moisturizer SPF 30 and am appreciating actual results."
I'm 25 yrs old and I have sensitive skin that tends to dry out with everyday cleansing this is perfect because you get the cleansing you need but your skin doesn't dry out because you only use it a few times a week...the pad is a little rough but nothing painful...great product for the price!
"I've been using this device for a month now and I absolutely love the way my face looks. It has revived my dull looking skin, giving it a smooth appearance and radiant glow. My daughter and husband have commented on how much healthier my complexion looks. I will definitely continue using this device!"
It's very nice. I like it. Thank you for your products
I just got the Microdermabrasion system and after the first use my skin was instantly soft to touch and felt refreshed. Love it!
Wow! this thing is great! i love it. it feels so relaxing when you cleaning your face.
Makes my face feel wonderful!
I really like the results! I've used it about 3 times now. It's very easy to use and works well. I'll be using it on a regular basis to keep my skin clean and clear.
"Just bought the microdermabrasion kit. Eager to use but couldn't. Battery compartment would not budge/open. Disappointed no instructions inserts only instructions on outside of box. Chipped nails. Tried metal nail file, butter knife. Nope. Returning. I use other Neutrogena products even the acne light mask stopped working before the battery counter ran out. Some of led lights stopped working."
Definitely made my skin smoother after first use. I was careful to read the directions before I went all in as I was afraid the pad maybe more abrasive than I wanted. I would recommend moisturizing after using. I can't wait to see the results after a couple more rounds! The second time I used this my acne and combination skin has calmed down and evened out and even some acne scars are lighter!
"I was so excited to try this product, but the battery compartment absolutely will not budge. It's like it's glued shut. And since the batteries came packaged separately, I haven't been able to turn it on. So disappointing. Please help"
I just used it once and immediately I noticed my skin felt very soft and smooth after. The next morning my skin already looks like its getting more clear. I have a slight uneven skin tone and I see that improving also. I can't wait to see how my skin is going to look and feel months from now.
"By far one of the best thing i have ever purchased, my skin feels and looks amazing every time i use this. My skin is clean bright and soft for days after use. I will never stop using this tool. I purchased one for my best friend and my mom because I love it so much."
"The machine itself is great. It gets down deep and cleanses really well, leaving a nice smooth face. It has even helped even out some of my sun damage. However, the cleanser in the pads make me break out in acne very easily. I wish they would make plain ole pads without cleanser. I now rinse the pads completely before attaching and use my own cleanser. You also have to make sure you don't overuse them, or it will dry out your skin very fast. Use a good moisturizer afterward."
i bought this product the other day and used it that night and at first i couldnt see much results but then the next day after using it i had less dark spots and my face was smoother! i completely love this product i would tell anyone else who has dark spots and acne to use this product it works wonderfully for the price!!!!!
"I love how my face feels after using this facial cleansing system. However, I've only had it for a couple of months and it stopped working. I bought one for my son as well, and his has stopped working. Are these things supposed to stop working after only a few months of use? I would've given five stars if they still worked."
"i used this product and during the first week i loved it but the second week.....ugh! pimples all over forehead and chin probably where my acne prone areas are, but wow ive never had a breakout like this, would not recommend to someone with combination skin!"
"I am thrilled that Neutrogena brought this product back. It is one of the BEST microdermabrasion products available. I purchased another one b/c this one was discontinued but my skin does not feel the same. I had routinely used this product for the past five years and my skin looked radiant, had fewer acne, and less lines. Just one use makes one's skin feels much softer and makes a noticeable difference!! I will continue to use this product as long as it is available. Glad it is back!! YES, buy this..."
I used this product before and loved it. When it disappeared from the market I was able to find the pads up until 2 months ago. As soon as I saw it was back on the market I bought 3 boxes of refills. At 58 this is as good as having professional microdermabrasion done. My skin is soft and the wrinkles are improved. I use it 3 times a week and don't want to be without it again. My skin no longer looks rough and old looking. Thank you Neutrogena!
I purchase my kit yesterday to help exfoliate and remove dead skin cells. I use a skincare regimen that also exfoliates and remove dark pigmentation from my skin. This kit helps enhances the exfoliation process and has my skin looking extremely good and glowing after the first use.
I was reluctant at first. I pay 5x the price of this machine to have my esthetician perform the same service. Extremely pleased with the results. Can't wait to see the transformation after one week...
I am 43 year old. Never took care of my skin. Except when I was a teenager. Ugly acne scars. I'd pile on liquid foundation and powder to cover up my scars. All I have to say this is one excellent product. I can see dark spots disappearing right before my eyes. I loved it and will continue using. I used on my husband and teenager. They notice with the first treatments. Thank you Neutrogena greatly appreciate
"I was totally dismayed when they d/c this device that is perfect for an at home microdermabrasion. It is good for my sensitive skin because it does not ""scratch my face open,"" yet it totally removes dead skin cells and after a month of using this 2x a week it ended up taking 10 years from my face. Thank you Neutrogena for bringing it back and making beauty accessible for a lot of females."
"I love this product, I bought 2. I tore off the replacement head too hard and broke it, so I got a 2nd one. I use this every night after cleaning my face and use it again to help run in my rose water infused moisturizer. I would love to get a head replacement for my first set and use one for moisturizing and one for cleaning, but have not found the piece yet. Would still recommend, just easy with the head piece."
"I read a review about the product in an insert in our local newspaper. l decided to try it. I loved the way it made my face feel after using it. It felt soft and clean. I am using it three times a week. My face looked dry and scaly underneath my make-up before trying it. Now, it has a soft and smooth appearance. Wal-mart had the lowest price online ."
"I used this product off and on...but have changed to 3 times per week. I have seen a much younger looking face. There is a glow, refreshed look, and my complexion is much better. Skin tone is firmer and color is more uniform. My granddaughter asked if I had make up on...She's 7 years old...what does that say. At 63, skin care is important."
"I am sixty-eight years of age and have just recently found Neutrogena. All products used so far have been terrific. As I have started a low carb diet and using your products my wrinkles have lessened considerably. Previously I wanted a laser technique to make me appear younger, but now I don't think I need this and I look 10 years younger. I have two other brush systems, but they dry my skin out of the moisture needed. Thanks so much."
I have had microderm in a doctors office and this little machine is just about as good as. My skin is soft and smooth and clean and pink. I use it approximately 3 times a week and it really helps slough off all the old skin cells that dull your complexion. I am a senior citizen and everyone asks what I use on my skin. This Really Works.
"Had I known what I know now I would have been using this many years ago. I am 46, wrinkles under eyes, lip lines, uneven skin tone, brown spots and dull skin. I used this last night for the first time, my skin looks tighter and smoother. I cannot wait for the end results! Thank you Neutrogena!"
I purchased this product approximately four months ago. I started using it once a week and then increased to three times a week. My skin is so incredibly soft and I could totally tell a big difference with fine lines around my mouth and four head. I would totally recommend this product to anyone and everyone.
"I am 48 and have adult acne battles. I purchased this yesterday and used it last night. My face is noticably smoother. I am hoping it helps exfoliate and impoves my overall skin appearance! and of course, I hope it improves my clogged pores and blemishes. I'll keep you posted!"
I used this device when it first came out. It was an interesting device and I tried it. In two months my spots on my face were gone. I had really bad spots. People at work would comment on how bad it looked. Make up would make them more pronounced. Until I tried this device and coupled with spf 50 I can say I look great. My spots are gone.
"My skin was dull, saggy, bumpy, and had uneven color. After the first use my skin was baby-bottom smooth. After two weeks I stopped piling on the makeup. After a month I went to work without make up and someone told me my skin looked great. What a confidence boost!"
"I'm almost 65 & have bumpy, blotchy skin. I recently purchased this & I LOVE it! My skin was smoother the first time I used it & my skin color & lines are so much better after one week!!! At first I thought I was doing something wrong because I thought the head was supposed to rotate...but I guess not. Anyway, it vibrates like crazy & I massage it on my face & it's working! I am doing it right, aren't I????"
Been using thios product for about a week. The results are astonishing. I keep looking in the mirror because I just can't believe something so inexpensive can be so effective. i use it every day. My skin is firmer. I am 62 and my skin radiates. What an amazing product. Keep up the good work Neutrogena.
"I just recently purchased this product, went home and tried it and WOW! I couldn't believe it. My skin was soft and glowing. I have not taken care of my skin at all (I'm 56) and was having to compensate with a heavier foundation. After using it three times , I went back to my old makeup products. I just love the glow of my skin after using it. You hit a home run on this! I'm so very pleased."
"Even after the first use I noticed a huge improvement in my skin. I've used regular scrubs daily for YEARS with the hopes of removing most of the dead skin from my face, but never acheived even HALF of the effectiveness as the Microdermabrasion system. I even recommended this product to my 59 year old mother and she raves about how great her skin looks and feels. This is an amazing product!"
"I am 52 and I live in Florida. I have extremely light, thin skin. I thought my facial skin had lost it's softness and smoothness. I tried the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion system just once and right away my skin felt like it did when I was 25! I totally recommend this product to anyone who feels their skin has changed or lost it's softness. I will use this product 3 to 4 times a month. However, if your skin is not sensitive you can use it up to 3 times a week! Try Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System!"
"I had an appointment for a facial today but it was canceled, so when I was grocery shopping today and saw this on the shelf while picking up mascara, and bought it on impulse. What a great find!! I've used it just today, and my skin feels amazing, and definitely has a better ""tone"". I will tell all my friends about this product!!"
This did everything it promised to do and more. I never really had breakouts but I have had to be careful on the cleansers i've used because some are just too harsh and break out my skin. This kit makes my skin feel super smooth without any breakouts. I actually feel I can go out without foundation and be perfectly accepted in society.
"I used this product years ago & stopped ( I'm not sure why ) and started back up a short time ago! I never should have stopped! There really is a difference in my skin! I use it on my face , neck and chest. I'm noticing a difference in the feel & fine lines are less. It's really helping with my chest lines.....I'll be using this product for life!"
43 Years old acne prone skin / scars. Ive tried a lot of products threw the years on my face & most break me out worse. My aunt told me about this system months ago. I hate I waited so long. My Skin Is Amazing. Its been 4 weeks. Ive been using the Rapid tone repair and this system and got Noticeable result in 1 week. Yes I cried. Everyone has commented on how much better my skin looks. I will be testing each product from Neutrgena. I use a very pricey system right now with minimum results.
"The instructions clearly state use 3 times a week. If it is used more than this I assume it would dry your skin out, common sense. I noticed a difference in my skin after 1 use and even had a few comments about my beautiful skin. I will never stop using this but I will not go over the recommended 3 times a week. This is worth every cent I paid many times over. My skin feels great and without high spa prices!!!"
I am 56 and have always had great skin but recently I noticed fine lines creeping in and some age spots. After the first time I used it my skin was extremely soft and felt great. The second week I noticed the lines weren't as noticeable. I can hardly wait for week four!
"This is the only product you will need! The price is right and it works wonders. I have been using it fow two weeks and i see the difference. My skin has a new softer coat, do not over pay for products similar to this, this IS THE PRODUCT. I love it! Great job Neutrogena, thanks for not over pricing such a great product."
"I have had severe acne since 3rd grade and at this point in my life, have dark acne scars. My mom bought me this system and after 3 uses, have seen great improvements. I realize the scars will not go away, but they have drastically faded. My skin is left red and dry, but using moisturizer solves that problem."
I watched youtube before buying it and I must say it does make your face feel soft now if you use it on the highest speed it can be a bit abrasive but I loved it now what I did was wet my face first and half way through the procedure I wet my face again to make thicker lather and I am 2 days without using it and my face is still soft with a soft glow like if you put lotion on your face. I cant wait to see what it does in the long run I only been using it for 1 week.i have dark spots on my cheeks and I can see them lightening up.
I used the product once and after 2 days I'm seeing red spots kind of like a rash/little pimples on my face. I'm not sure if it's just because I have sensitive skin but I've never had this kind of reaction on my face. Kind of disappointed because of all the good reviews and I don't know if I should keep using it
50 yr old male - great results from this machine. It's simple to use. I don't have problem skin other than aging but 've gotten great results and has really smoothed my skin. I typically use it twice weekly. I purchased around a month ago after reading all of the positive reviews. Well worth the small price and will be gifting this to several people this holiday season.
"I love this product! I have always had such a horrible time with blackheads and larger pores and this product really really reduces these problems. I only use it once a week because I can't afford to use it more than that, but my skin is so soft, and plus I've been eating well, and these puffs make me want to keep it all up! I like to feel my skin and want my husband to do the same now!"
I do love this product especially the morning after you just look so well rested!! I am 41 and look to be about 10 years younger!! Been using this product for about 6 months. I also love the way your skin feels after each use the only down side is I do have some pigmantion that I am trying to get rid of doesn't seem to do anything to that!!
"i recently quit smoking and started focusing on damage control for my skin....saw this in the store and bought it. first use my skin was soooo soft and glowing. i am so glad i got this, i look forward to making it a part of my normal routine, works soo much better than a face scrub. leaves my skin soft and glowy and shiny(in a good way!) highly recommend it!"
"I bought mine a few months ago and love it! My skin feels and looks great. I have had facials that were not as effective as this little machine! And my pores seem visibly reduced. I bought two more for my daughter and daughter-in-law and they love to use theirs also. It works so well, and saves us money at the spa. Plus, it was such a good price to begin with. My husband is now using it!"
"I bought this to lighten the spots on my face. On the box it says it can take up to a month to see results, I saw results in a couple of weeks. My skin was not dry and the fine lines are disappearing as well. I am so pleased with this product but then again it's neutrongena, a name we all trust!!"
"I have been having microdermabrasion done at a doctor's office for years - all the while looking for an effective home use product. This one does the trick. While not as powerful as the machine at my doctor's office, i did not get the suction marks either. Additionally, i can do a treatment whenever i want to and a great reduced price."
"I've been a Neutrogina girl all my life so I couldn't wait to try this. The first time I used it I saw a dramatic difference, my face was so soft and youthful looking. I noticed within a week or so lines and age spots disapearing ..It's wonderful and I'm hooked! I've been using it ever since. I tell everyone it's an amazing product at a great price!"
"My skin felt baby smooth after one application. My husband EVEN noticed....huge plus. I was able to convince him to just ""try a facial"", and he had to admit that his skin felt very smooth and soft. He was sold and I am beyond sold on this product. Very pleased with the results and I am noticing all of my years of sun damaged skin is disappearing and seems firmer.......more than I had hoped for."
Bought this on a whim...looking for something be cause my 40-something year old skin needed help and salon visits are not in the budget. Holy chocolate sauce. This stuff is AMAZING! My face felt so good afterward...felt good during treatment as well! My kit came with an extra 2-month supply of pads as a bonus. LOVE!!
I recently had a facial using the Clarisonic product. Loved how my skin felt after so I was shopping for one and found this at 1/10th the price. Thought it'd be worth a try. After just 2 uses I am extremely pleased. Thanks for making a cost efficient product!!!
"I am a skeptic by nature so when I saw this product on a health and beauty show, I was doubtful; but I purchased one anyway and WOW what a difference. Even after the first use my skin looked and felt smooth and rejuvenated. Repeated uses were more awesome. I love this product so much I give it as gifts. Try it, you'll love it!"
"My skin has never felt so smooth!! A noticeable difference even after the first use. Skin feels softer, looks more luminous, and is starting to feel firmer and I have only been using it for 3 weeks. Also I am prone to break outs and this is gentle enough to use, and has helped keep acne at bay. Love this product! I can't imagine life without it now."
"The microdermabrasion system is magic. I live in the sun belt and am a senior citizen. So skin issues were evident. One week of using the system and people started telling me how good I look. One thing I do that is not mentioned, after using the blue pad side, I turn the pad over for a final spin. My skin is glowing from this product. LOVE IT!"
"I am 18 and am prone to bad break outs. I have tried absolutely everything to keep my skin clean and blemish free but very few products work as I have an allergy to benzyl peroxide. My mama saw this system on tv and bought if for me today. I have to say this is the BEST product I have used. While it is the first night that I have used it, I already have noticed dermatologist level clearness of my skin. It looks better and cleaner, and feels great after just this one time. I will recommend this system to EVERYONE!!!"
"Like some other comments here, there is very little instructions how to use this product. It doesn't feel like it's cleaning but more like scrubbing your face with fine sand paper... It says focus 1-2minutes on a face area but there is very little moisture coming out that your face feels very dry and rough after.... Got skin irritations too."
"First time I used this product I could feel the difference in my skin. Love the smell of the cleanser to. I love the way it has taken care of my trouble spots, chin, nose. My pores appear smaller as well. I really feel clean and feel like it cleans all my makeup off that I may have missed I will be purchasing one for my daughters, I can't wait to share this with them."
I love this product. I have minor breakouts and some acne scars due to pretty bad acne from the past and I'm hoping with using this 3 times a week it will help with those scars. After the first use I couldn't believe how smooth my face was! I love using it and look forward to it each time.
"I used it for the first time last night and I could immediately feel a difference in my skin! It was so smooth and soft. I'm 43 and for some reason, my face has been breaking out like a 15 yr olds. I'm hoping this will help AND help with my *gasp* wrinkles that are starting to show. I am going to buy one for my 13 year old daughter now!"
Basically this isn't what I really was looking for. I was looking for a facial cleaning system with a brush that actually had bristles. This brush just has pads. I didn't return it since I had already purchased it. I thought I would try it. Nothing is wrong with it it's just not what I thought it was.
"I bought this product for myself about a week ago and noticed instant results after only 1 use! I am 22 and do not break out often, but I wanted something to make my pores smaller and help fight blemishes. After using this system for only a week I can feel that my skin is a lot healthier. I also had problems with dry skin and after using this my skin feels really soft. I absolutely love this product and would highly recommend it. I get excited just knowing I get to use it! Cannot not wait to continue enjoying the benefits of this system."
"I never rave about anything, but this product deserves a big cheer! The Microdermabrasion System has eliminated several sun damage spots and has made my skin softer and more lumunous. A friend that I had not seen in two years commented that my skin looked great! Great job, Neutrogena team! My only comment is that the refills seem a little pricey, but I would buy them at any price for these results!"
I orginally bought this item as a Christmas present for a friend. Finally I had to try it on myself. I was truly amazed at how soft my face felt so I tried it on my feet; so good I went out and bought 2 more for presents. I just cant say enough about this system and you cant go wrong buying one. WHERE WAS THIS PRODUCT WHEN I WAS A TEENAGER?
I really like using this product and would like to know what moisturizer I should be using with it. Neutrogena is the only skin care line I can use that doesn't break me out. What I love about the product is the way my skin feels and the compliments I get the day after. I have had my co-workers tell me I am glowing!
"All I can say is after many scrubs i have used over the years, this BEATS them all. Seriously. This is an awesome system. First time I used it, I could not believe the difference in my skin. I knew it did it's job!! Imagine how my skin would be using this 3 times a week."
I have been using the microdermabrasion system for a couple of weeks now and I love it. I actually look forward to using it because I can see a difference in my skin afterwards. My pores are smaller and my skin is soft and smooth. I am going to send one to my mum and sister in Australia because it isn't sold over there.
I have worked in cosmetics...and various other fields. I will not give a good review if something doesn't do what I expect! This product doesn't make any great promises! But it is terrific! I am 49 years old and still have acne. I am buying one for each of my two daughters!!!!
"I couldn't wait to try out this product! I used it the same day I received it and couldn't be happier with the results! After the first use, my skin was immediately softer. And after a few uses in a week, my skin seems brighter, clearer and just wonderful!"
I received this and was very excited so I triedit that night. When I went to use it a second time a week later it did not work. I tried switching the batteries with 3 different sets - no luck. I do not know if this is common or if I received a lemon.
"This dermal raisin system really works, right After the second time I used it I noticed a huge difference, smoother skin, tighter skin, pores less visible, I definately recommend it to anyone with oily skin like mine because if you have sensitive skin I think it will irritate it."
I just bought this today and tried it for the first time. And I must say I am blown away. My skin is already smoother and it feels wonderful!!! I was going to buy a competetors version and I'm so happy I bought this one instead. I'm thinking I should've bought this sooner!!!
I was looking to have a facial and thought WOW these prices are astronomical..So I read about the Neutrogena Microdermabrasion system and thought why not try it..I have uneven skin tone and large pores..After purchasing this kit and trying it as soon as I got home I instantly saw results after. The next morning my skin was baby soft and glowing. I love the feel and how easy it is to use!!!! Thanks Neutrogena!!!
I just got my system in the mail yesterday and used it this morning. My face was so soft and smooth that when I went to rinse my face my hands just slid on my skin. My lotions absorbed better and my face looks wonderful. I will use this as long as its out there. I love it!!!
"I was excited to find this product and at a great price!!!! Shipping was fast, the only thing I don't care for about the product is the smell. It's something to get use to for me though. My skin feels so soft and it is so relaxing!!! I recommend this product!"
"I was hesitant to purchase because of how low the price is but decided to buy based off the great reviews. I have been using this for about three weeks now and am very excited for the results I'm already seeing. My acne scars are fading extremely fast! Sun spots look lighter. I don't see a difference in wrinkles just yet but I haven't even been using for a month. My skin has never felt so soft or looked brighter. Great purchase, easy to set up and use. Completely satisfied with the results so far."
My felt smooth and exfoliated. Very user friendly.
Easy to use. Skin was soft and smooth after using it.
I ave used this product for years ad love the new and improved model even more.
"This is a nice set, a bit pricey. I wish they still offered coupons on this one. I like the textured scrubbing pads but prefer to use my own facial cleanser. The cleanser on each pad leaves a film or residue on my skin I don't like."
This product sucks! It's so rough for the face and you will spend a lot of money buying the replacement. Total bad buy
"Just started using this product. Saw and felt results with first use. Skin is brighter, feels smooth, pores appear ""cleaner."" Looking forward to great results over time."
I bought this a couple weeks ago and I love how my skin feels and looks directly after use but I break out with small white heads the following day. I'm not sure if this is normal
I love this! Noticed a difference in my pore size almost immediately. My face is much smoother. I have been using for a couple weeks now and my wrinkles around my eyes are becoming less noticeable. I'm 60 and wish I had started using this years ago.
I bought this a month ago and it does work.
"Nuetrogena, is this safe for daily use until you see the results you want?"
This question has been skipped before by neutrogena! I want to know!
never been happier with my skin.. maybe proactive. but that takes forever and you see results after the first use. It worked great on my acne scars and minimizing my pores!
I bought this a week ago. Have used it according to the instructions and I have already had folks telling me how great my skin looks. Clear and bright! Thank You!
I'm so happy I tried this product immediately I saw results it as lightened and completely removed dark marks on my face from picking pimples in the past I cannot express enough how happy I am that I tried it and will continue to use it!
"Every blackhead is gone! My skin is firmer, glowing, and just looks plain great. I would never be without this product. My pores are almost invisible now as well."
This stuff works great and makes a noticeable difference. The puffs have a clean smell too. But they don't have the puffs at every Walmart. So you might have to go hunting for them.
"I don't want to over do anything on my skin and only use this once a week. I love it! My mother is also interested and wants to know what is the recommended number of times each week to use it. I'm 55, she is 77."
"I was out shopping for a micro-dermabrasion system and ran into this little fella!! Boy was I very happy I did. It has done wonders to my face, neck, hands and elbows.I feel pretty once again!! New skin, New me :)"
I am a young college student who bought this product to try and get rid of acne marks. I have been thoroughly pleased with the results. My pores have never been more clear and clean. My face is always soft and fresh. I am so glad I bought this!
"This is one of the best products I've bought in a long time. Moderately priced, really lasts. Immediate results does NOT aggravate even my sensitive skin, or raw spots. Great lather and instantly skin looks better! Two thumbs up."
"I would have known this product in my teens ... . actually works with my skin I have pimples, blemishes and fine wrinkles my skin looks better when I use this product thank's netrogena"
Im 50 and tan and lay in the sun I recently stopped doing that so much and bought this for the dark patches. And 3 weeks later the dark patches are hardly noticeable love this use it 4x a week or more!
I've used this product for several years now and love it. Makes my skin glow. PLEASE don't discontinue. I was looking for the refills at a store and they didn't even have a place for them anymore.
I had been wanting a microdermabrasion system and my sister bought this for me for my birthday. You see results INSTANTLY! With consistent use it's made my skin very smooth and my pores noticeably smaller even after the first use.
"This is the second week! And the difference is amasing. As a kid I was out in the sun alot. At 65 years old I have age spots, dry patches, uneven skin tone etc. This product has excided what I thought would happien. Its not a gimmick! It works!"
"Love this product, love the price, its awesome, my skin looks and feels awesome, my pores look a lot smaller and my skin is clear and I swear glowing!"
"I just used this for the first time, and I am amazed. My skin feels truly clean for the first time in a long time. My face is soft and luminous. I have already told my mom and my best friend that they have to get this product!"
"I've only used this product once and my skin was as soft as a baby's bottom. My skin was so much brighter after one use, I can not wait to use it again. I've been telling all my friends and family about it."
Love this system. Feel so clean and softer after using his system in just one use. Look forward to each time I use it. Lines and brown spots diminished.
I have had professional microdermabrasion several times and this is fabulous for in between visits to the dermatologist!! Thank you for making this device affordable.
"I am a 40 yr old, AA woman. This product works wonders!!! I saw immediate results. I highly recommend this product. Neutrogena had been a trusted name in my household for a long time."
"I used this product for about 6 times so far, and I already noticed a difference in my skin appearance. The skin looks cleaner and younger. I hope it would fade my dark spots."
"I bought this system over a year ago and I love the results. I do not like using lots of creams and lotions etc., but this fits my simple routine perfectly! I have often been asked what I use on my skin - THIS is my secret!"
"I am working on a facial routine. I like the ""glow"" that the deamabrader leaves you with although I would like to see the redness fade quicker. Trying a lighter touch."
"Better than I thought it would be! It was so worth the price. My skin always feels so soft afterwards and I feel so clean and clear after using it. Although, I'm afraid that it would cause more acne because it's so rough, it hasn't!"
"I was considering ""real"" microdermabrasion when I saw the reviews on this system. After 2 uses I see much improvement to age spots. My skin feels so soft after use and I am thrilled with the results."
Not sure. At first it seemed very aggressive and the vibration hurt my face. Didn't seem to do much. But after 3 or 4 uses on a lower power level it seems to be a good thing. I don't really need much dermabrasion as I have very good skin.
What a great little tool. It did a better job than I expected. It left my skin feeling soft and silky smooth. I loved the ease of using it in the shower and it's so much easier to use than those messy micro dermabrasion kits.
I love this product! My skin feels so soft and smooth. It is easy to use - and so much more economical than the other brands on the market. Neutrogena products are wonderful.
I just got my Microdermabrasion System last week and so far I've used it twice. My face feels FANTASTIC. It is so smooth and soft. I am just addicted to the feel of it cleansing my face. HIGHLY recommend.
"I bought it for help with blackheads, but use it for my pre spray tan cleansing and also for scrubbing my husband's feet after a hard day at work! I lost the cap that you attach the pads on. Can I just buy that piece?"
I am glad i purchased this kit. I have been using it for about three months now and its great. My skin is so soft and visibly cleaner/clearer. I would suggest using it 3 times a week on alternating days for the best results. I love it!
This is a great little machine for the money! You wont be disappointed! I cant believe the difference in my facial skin. My hubby even said it looked like it was taking my wrinkles away after just 2 uses. Just go get one - hurry!
"I have had salon dermabrasion, but after using this product I will never pay for those again! After one use, my skin is smooth and flawless, and looks great!"
"I decided to finally try a cleansing system, and am so glad I tried this! My skin is so smooth! I am pretty picky about scents also, and this has a very nice, pleasant scent- not overwhelming, and definitely no chemical in nature. Highly recommend."
I love this product works wonderful - nice scent - not too strong and I have very sensitive skin and it works just great! Smoother nicer feeling and looking skin. GREAT!
"Originally when I used this product I was very happy with the results. I used this product once every 3-4 months if that. Two nights ago I figured it was time again, this time I have disapointing results. This product left my skin with tiny clusters of bumps all around my jawline and cheeks leaving my skin with a less than satisfactory texture. Now I'm patiently waiting for my skin to become smooth again."
works would like to have a brush with it also
Great product. Makes cleansing my face a treat. Would recommend.
was offered for sale to me for $250.
I'm very happy beacause it is excelent! I recommend it!
this isn't a review. I just can't get the battery compartment open.
I use this product twice a week. It does work. My face looks great
"Was going to buy a ProSonic but I saw this just in time. I tried it today and I cannot believe what it did to my skin. Got rid of all the dirt, blackheads, bumps and closed the pores on my nose. This is a miracle machine for people who have bad skin and use it for the first time. If you have good skin already don't expect to see a difference just a clean face but if you have skin problems this little machine will go a long way."
"I was eager to try this product and admittedly had high expectations based on other reviews. However after using the product for several weeks I haven't seen the improvement I anticipated. According to the product description and the ""stats"" outlined on the packaging I was expecting my face to look and feel remarkably better. My face seems to be more dry and I've had increased breakouts...two of things I was most trying to avoid :("
"I've used every product imaginable to help my skin smooth out and decrease the dark blemishes I have. I've only used the product four times so far since I purchased it a couple of weeks ago and my skin already feels much smoother and even. It'll take a little more time I'm sure for the dark blemishes to go away, but I can definitely feel an improvement so far. I have sensitive skin as well and this pads don't irritate my skin at all. I only use three times week so I don't dry out my skin."
"I love this. I used it for a week now and it's great. My skin feels soft and looks better than it has in a while. It actually looked like I had a healthy glow. I did find that there is so much ""soap"" on the pads that I can use them more than once to extend the use from them,so that's an even bigger plus!!!!"
"This is a great product. I have been using this product 3x a week for 7 weeks. I have noticed that my age spots have faded a great deal, my skin is firmer and the lines I have are reduced. It is so wonderful to get a product that does what it says it will do."
i'm happy I got the kit! I used to go to spas to get a facial and other beauty treatments but since I moved I have not been able to.. I saw this product at my local grocery and checked it online :) so glad i did because the neutrogena website had a better deal! The day I get the kit I tried it and I must say that it feels very clean but non-irritating. My skin has felt smoother and my uneven skin tone has improved in just the two weeks that I've used it. I'm so happy with the results that I got one for my sister as well :)
"I received this product this week and after 2 uses, my skin feels amazing! It really does look brighter and all those little marks on my skin don't seem as outstanding as they used. Love this product and will definately be using for a very long time!"
First time user and I canât wait to see the results after continued use. My face is as soft as i have ever felt it
New to me but I like it so far. Works great and the results are still not sure.
"This machine gets my skin smooth and clean. I have seen machines that do this for hundreds of dollars, but this one is just right for me."
I've only used it twice but so far I like it. I just don't see anywhere that tells me how often I should do it.
"I'm sooooo happy Neutrogena launched this microdermabrasion device, one that is affordable and makes my skin feel so smooth and look glowing!"
"Because I was shipped a USED item. Gross! If you are ordering this product, I'd strongly recommend double-checking the box."
"After the first treatment, I noticed a difference in my skin. It is definitely more radiant and smooth. I have a youthful glow."
"Neutrogena Microdermabrasion Cleansing System is a otimo scrub, massage with vibrations, leaves very soft skin, and clean. I really liked."
"First day using this and my skin definitely looks brighter, more even, firmer and the 2 little lines on my forehead are drastically reduced. Woot!"
"I love the idea and the price, but the ingredients are just not natural enough. Will you be developing a more natural product?"
"Blown away by this product. One use and my skin is soft, brighter looking, and fresh. So beyond impressed! Can't wait to see the long-term effects."
I purchased this product and the first time I used it my skin felt amazing. I recommend this to everyone.
Love this product! Saw results the first week. My skin feels smooth and fine lines gone. Make sure to use the neutrogena cream for the best results.
I wish I had started using this sooner! I love the way my skin looks and feels!! You should make one for your whole body!!
I have used the product 3 times in the past few weeks. My skin feels and looks amazing. I wish that I knew about this product a long time ago.
Love love love this product!! Does exactly what it says it does!!! I could tell a difference as soon as I used it!! Highly recommend this product!!
"First use and WOW! If your looking for a microdermabrasion kit that's budget friendly and works, its this one!:-)"
"I've only had this product for a week and I'm in love with it! So far, my skin feels and has never felt softer / smoother... Thank you Neutrogena!"
"While it is not as good as a micro treatment, you can not beat what it does for the price. My skin felt great after 1 application."
No one believes my age of 47 this product is great for the price you cant go wrong.My 16 year old daughter also loves it helps her oily skin.
Leaves your face feeling smoother...but it's only temporary.....way over priced.....costly...not worth it.
"I'm so pleased with this product! Also, I read several reviews saying there are no directions. They are on the back of the box at the bottom."
I bought one for my daughter and one for myself. We are both very pleased with how it makes our skin feel. Thank you!!
I have used my microderm system only three times and I notice a big difference already! It's marvelous!
This was not what I had hoped it would be. I was actually wanting a brush head and this is more of a vibrating cleansing pad.
"Best device ever! If you are concerned about the vibration being strong, slide the setting down a notch (there are two settings: high"
It worked like a charm and so easy to use. It was very gentle and I used it on the lowest speed to ensure my sensitive skin would be ok. I used a moisturizer afterward and now my skin is baby soft.
A must have for a wonderful (and inexpensive!) skincare system!
I bought this tonight literally a half hour ago and was super excited to use it. I used it for under a minute and it died. Tried changing the batteries and it was dead dead. This is garbage.
I loved my Microdermabrasion System but the pads will not stay stuck to the wand. There used to be a sticky substance on the attachment head but it must have peeled off with the used pad. Is there a replacement item?
Amazing results. Ive been using this product since 2011 with no regrets its done wonderful things for my skin. It long lasting Ive travel with it since a couple of times and its still like new!!!
Just bought product today but have been doing research for a few weeks now. Did first scrub about an hour ago and result was phenomenal . Skin was beyond baby soft and looked slightly lighter. Can't wait to continue product!
I am so Happy that this system is back it is the only product of this type that actually works!!! i would recommend this product and have in fact done so in the past now i can recommend it again to all my friends and relatives..
I was out looking for another brand but decided to purchase this. Oh my it is amazing! I used it as soon as I came home from a morning of shopping and I see a pleasant difference! I immediately came to the website so that I could write a positive review! I am quite pleased with the purchase!
My daughter bought this for me years ago. I recently left it in the shower in at the gym. I hope the battery lasts as long on this one! I never had to replaced them on the old one:) This will handy little tool will brighten your face. Feels great too!
"My skin needed this! The wand is super easy to operate and has two different settings of vibration. The pads that come with it can be used more than once, I have used them twice and then throw them away. It works wonders for exfoliation and creating softer skin. I use this in conjunction with Neutrogena skin cream and my face feels fantastic and you can see a difference from before I started using it two weeks ago."
"I have oily skin, big pores,scars. This product helps my skin. Thanks NEUTROGENA"
I used it one time and liked it so much I am buying one for my Mom!
I have had this scrubbing brush for 10 years and never been happier!
i canh't believe how smooth this got my skin the first use! will continue to use.
LOVE! tried it only once so far...skin became smoothe
Like the product. Is attchment head sold separately?
Wear out first.
"First time using it, very pleased. Do I moisturize afterwards?"
Its great my face is already softer and smoother I only used it once
I really love this face scrubber. I love how clean my face feels after I use it.
Only been using this product for two weeks. Amazing difference. You have to try it.
This item does a great job of giving your skin a microdermabrasion!
All this does is vibrate on your face doesn't spin or turn and i do not feel my face is clean after using it.
It is convenient and does a great job. This is the second one I have purchased. Wore the first one out. Fabulous product! Amazing results!
I have been using this product for about two weeks now and I am very happy with the results. This is a must-buy product for women. Lovelovelove
I have used this product for going on two years now. It makes my face so smooth and clean. I absolutely love it.
it is works. it is convenient it is affordable. and it is the best in every way. Please make it for body.
I noticed a definite difference in my skin after only one use. My skin is glowing. The price was great too!
"Could not believe how soft my skin my skin was after one use. Also, am noticing my age spots seem to be fading. Great product. Great value."
"It leaves my face feeling so clean and refreshed, works excellent at taking off foundations and liquids left behind by soap. I always put a face moisturizer on after I use this and they work well together! Super soft, clean, and smooth skin"
"I could really tell a difference after I did this once, my face was so soft I couldn't believe it. I can't wait to do it again. looking forward to healthy soft shiny skin. I would definitely recommend this ."
I love the microdermabrasion system my face feels sooo sofr and looks a lot better after one week. I would recommend this product to everyone. I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I was so excited to use this product based in all the good reviews about it, but unfortunately it did not work at all for me, it actually highlighted the fine lines around my eyes."
I saw results immediately; I know it doesn't get rid of wrinkles but it must clean them out good because they looked decreased on the first use. Skin is softer; only used it twice but looking forward to using it again and again!!
the best product i have bought this year i ha ve told my daughters and friends about nrutrogena i am going to give this as x-mas presents what more can i say it's terrific
"This product was very easy to use and my face felt so refreshed after. I've only used it twice so far, so I'm not sure if the benefits will last, but so far so good. I would recommend it at this time."
I didn't think I would like this product as much as I do. I'm getting married next month & I've decided that I'm going to buy one for all my brides maids & maid of honor. It's the perfect gift for everyone. Love it!!!
I really liked this product and it made my skin amazing but I eventually ran out and I kept forgetting to buy new puffs and then I started to get very bad acne ( like whiteheads ) and then they started to go away and became big deep cystic acne I'm reusing this product to see if it'll help get rid of my dark spots and cystic acne it caused me but overall I did like it just don't stop using it !!!
I bought this product to even out my skin because I didn't want to spend a lot of money on professional microdermabrasion treatments. Wow! My face is definitely more even toned. I mean it's amazing how fast the result were. I am also using skin boosters facial wash with vitamin e. I love Neutrogena!
"My skin is soft after only a few uses. I have dry skin. This means it's often rough and make-up doesn't always look great. I sometimes get breakouts because of the dryness, too. When I saw that this was priced so well, I thought I'd give it a try. It's gentle- doesn't hurt or turn my skin red, but I can tell that it's definitely helping to get some of that roughness off."
"I have used the kit a few times, but so far I like it! My skin feels smooth and clean after using it. It makes it feel tight which I like and seems to be helping my large pores appear smaller and gives my skin an overall nicer appearance. For me it works!!"
"Love, love, love how soft and smooth my skin feels and looks every time I use my Neutrogena Microdermabrasion System. I have sensitive skin, so I was a bit hesitant to order this item as I thought it might be too harsh for my skin type, but as long as I don't press too hard against my skin and don't use it too frequently, I know I'll be fine. I do notice some redness immediately after I use it, but it goes away in a few minutes. I totally recommend it if you want your skin to glow."
"I use twice a day to maintain smooth, firm skin. I love it,"
I have to say that I'm glad that I purchased this product! It definitely Does what it Do!! Thanx
"After using this small, handheld device, your face feels like you just had a Salon Facial!!!"
good product and good value. I love it...................
Just startd using it and it works on the first try. Great scrubber already pre ready jus wet an use. Best things in my night treatment.
After one use my skin showed a small difference.It made my face smoother to the touch and it gave my skin a nice glow.
"Love this but be careful how much u use it i used it to much and my face was sheading skin for days,was peeling it of like a snake."
I am extremely happy with my purchase and have already recommended a friend who purchased it and is also delighted.
"Please make a softer brush. the only one you sell is way too abrasive on the skin, Please makes a brush that will not tear you're skin up, then I would love to us it. I tore my skin to pieces using the brush that comes with it.Thanks"
Greed product! Everybody asked me what I did to my skin! You will know how often to use it cause your skin will let you know. Once or twice a week was good fir me! Also great price
"You won't be sorry about buying this. The reviews tell the truth. I use the pad about five times. Letting it dry out in between. I also put my own face cleanser on the pad. I bought the Clinique machine and it is inferior to this, plus the cost was over $80.00. Buy this instead"
"I purchased this product about 6 mos ago & have been please with the results of my skin. But, the velcore disc on the unit is coming off & is no longer working correctly when I adhere a new cleaning pad. Can my unit be replace or what do you suggest I do to keep the disc to stay on the power unit?? Please respond"
"Product does not do as ads say. After first use, skin was slightly smoother, but oily acne kicked in the next week. After second use, skin actually felt rougher. I get a better response with a hand scrub, no machine needed. Also, I thought the head would rotate, it doesn't, it just vibrates back and forth, breaking down your collegen. Save your $$."
"I use it for 2weeks now, it drys my skin every time, need to put on lotion immediately. Skin is smoother, but pore problem didn't improve, fine line and sun spot haven't see any improvement yet. I will use longer and see. I would say it is a alright exfoliation, nothing too special about it atm. If you looking for a new exfoliation product, you can give it a shot."
Gets his face clean and is helping control the acne.
I seen and felt immediate results
I love this product. Since using this product the dry spots on my face have dramatically decreased.
"This made my skin feel like velvet after the 1st use, I love it...."
"I felt a change within 2 weeks of using the system. My skin is very soft, and it just feels great"
It surely is a great product and has made a visible difference to my skin.
I love this product. Not only is it cheaper but works better than a more expensive system out there.
This product is fantastic! I noticed softer and smoother skin after using this for the first time. Thanks Neutrogena!
So easy to use and great results immediately! I love it and have finally found a simple way to keep my skin looking great. Thank you Neutrogena!!
"very nice product, bought a few to surprise my dearest friends. Wish they would sell it in Holland as well."
"I love this product! I just bought it and used it once. My skin is so smooth after only one use. My question is, do u lotion afterwards? I didn't this time, but I'm wondering if I should be? Thanks!!"
I couldn't take the vibration - it tickled my face so couldn't use it. I guess I thought it would be more like turning instead of vibrating. I also don't like anything that has a fragrance to it.
"After a months use, my skin is definately firmer, but there is no difference in my facial lines or sun spots. I will continue to use, because I already purchased the refills, but its not really worth the trouble."
"There is nothing to keep the puff on the attachment head, maybe mine is defective if some people love it, but its back to the store with mine. Better off just buying the puff replacements and doing it manually."
"I have bought 4 of these from 3 different stores, one of them with a different lot number from the other three and not one of them worked. The cap will NOT snap on"
"i bought this because of a special promo from a tv show. i thought it would be good to rid my face of dry flakes, but it doesn't work any better than a washcloth."
"Everyone wants to know my secret to glowing skin, and I have been sharing the secret: Neutrogena Wave system. Everyone I turn on to this is raving, while watching their pesky little facial lines disappear."
"I used this just once with success. After that, I couldn't remove the head, even with a screwdriver. I am using the pads manually and will discard the device when I can get it open to remove the batteries."
I bought this system yesterday and was really excited to use it today. Unfortunately the instructions were lacking and I was unable to use it. I will take it to the store where I bought it and try to get my money back.
"i've used this for about a month now and I see a slight difference in my acne scarring only slight but i'm so self conscious about my skin. this has helped...the only thing i'm curious about is, are you supposed to put on moisturizer afterwards?"
I've just recently received my microabrasion system. I have used it for one week and my skin is already so much softer! I am looking forward to continuing with this. I have used other Nutrogena products in the past and always been pleased with them.
Product made my face feel clean and tight but did not see any visible difference. The pads felt a little like sandpaper on my face. Not my favorite product.
It is not working for me. No change after applying.
i have used this a few times now my skin is no different than before
Skin was soft and appeared much clearer after one time use.
I guess the product works but I am still unsure if the blue side or the other side goes against the skin. Very poor instructions.
"It just vibrates, does not rotate. And it vibrated my hand more than the head. Lame, HUGE waste of money."
Maybe mine is defective but the attachment head is like a closed cap. Nothing from the wet blue puff can get through the cap.
"Love it. Easy to use. This is my second one, first one lasted over ten years."
Product is very drying! Guess its due to the sulfate
Does not spin it is more of a vibrating massage for your face than a abrasions .
Love it! Love it! My skin is looking so much better and so soft and smooth. *U*
My face is so smooth!
