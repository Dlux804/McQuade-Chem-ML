I have a really dry skin and I constantly going to need moisturizer. I am glad Burts bees offer varieties of it that I could switch from time to time.
One of my favorite moisturizers
I've been using this for about a week and I must say I'm in love. It makes my hands soft too which is a plus! I haven't experienced any breakouts and my skin isn't as oily as it usually is. I will be buying this product again!
"I've been using this moisturizer for about a year and it's been amazing, but I recently purchased a new bottle and both the packaging and consistency were very different. Super disappointed."
"I've used Burt's Bees Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream for several years and I really liked it. Now that they have changed the shape of the bottle to tall and thin, the lotion is very watery and it is not the same lotion. I have purchased several bottles of the taller 1.8 oz and they are all very watery. I feel like they cheapened it by adding water. Very disappointed. I no longer recommend it to friends."
"I have very sensitive skin and when I found the sensitive skin cleanser and moisturizer my face finally found relief! For years I have had perfect skin. Now that they have changed, my skin is red, irritated, burns and feels like thousands of tiny bugs crawling all over. So disappointed"
I love this moisturizer! It leaves my face feeling refreshed without feeling oily. I have had no negative side effects (no rashes or reactions) with this face lotion.
"My biggest problem, however, is the packaging. One of the things I appreciate about Burt's Bees is the focus on natural ingredients, and plastic is not natural. Using glass would be a great upgrade for the appearance of the product and the overall environmental impact."
"I liked it, however, for a woman in her 50s for me, it was not hydrating enough and the hydration did not last a long time. For young women, I am sure it would be great. I did like it though, and I love how Burt's Bees products are more natural and safe."
"i wouldn't say my skin is sensitive, but it is very oily and my pores are large and clog easily. this moisturizer works wonders for me. all you need is a pump and it goes on smoothly. it soaks into my skin immediately and it feels like theres nothing on my face afterwards. with other moisturizers i get oily about an hour after but with this i dont get oily all. day. my skin feels soft and looks glowy, and it doesn't clog my pores. this is a major win."
So loved this Burt's bees lotion did not make my face oily and not one breakout. Only downfall I wish it was a little bigger it's a little pricey for only 1.8 ounces so definitely used it sparingly. Other than that this is my Holy Grail of moisturizer.
"i really liked this face cream. i put it on after a shower morning or night. theres no strong smells, not greasy or sticky, very smooth and feels good. its just plain lotion and does its job. if i want a perfumy smell i can use a perfume. i dont need it in my lotion."
"I love this product and believe me I am not one to praise many products. It is light-weight and goes on skin very smoothly. What I like best about it is that make-up can be applied immediately afterwards and it also goes on smoothly over the moisturizer. With other moisturizers, I have had to wait as long as 30 minutes before applying make-up because it would always go on cakey and blotchy. I am so pleased with this Burt's Bees product."
"I love love love Burt's Bees Daily Face Moisturizer Cream for Sensitive Skin! It is light, non greasy and absorbs well. I have sensitive skin and tend to breakout easily, and while using this moisturizer, I never broke out once! Definitely purchasing again!"
I absolutely love this face cleanser. Burt's Bees Daily Face Moisturizer Cream For Sensitive Skin is my new go to for face wash. I love using it everyday. I start with warm water and then lather with hot water. Finally rinse with ice cold water to make my pores tighten. Hopefully that equals less impurities getting into my pores in the first place. I have already bought this and use it daily.
I have combination skin so this made me a little bit more oily. I let my friend use it who has dry skin and within two days her skin have more moisture and better pigmentation. So all in all good if you have dry skin not too great if your skin is more on the oily side
"BURTS BEES DAILY FACE MOISTURIZER CREAM FOR SENSITIVE SKIN, This product felt very creamy and moist on my fingers. Easy to use, lotion was of an appropriate consistency. Soothed the dry spots on my face and neck. Is especially good, because it's suitable for sensitive skin."
"I really enjoyed having the opportunity to try this product before purchasing. Burt's Bees did not disappoint ! I had no doubt, due to the brand being so great with everything I have tried by them thus far, but, there is always a tad bit of skepticism when it comes to placing products on my face. This absolutely delivered ! An added plus was that it was for sensitive skin, which is what I have. This will be a staple in my facial regimen moving forward."
"This is a lightweight moisturizer, with the texture of a thin lotion. It's nice for warm weather when you don't want a heavy cream on your face. My skin is very dry in the winter, not so much during the rest of the year, so I tend to wear lighter moisturizers in the summer. This is a nice one."
"I dont normally use a moisturizer, but i received a sample of this cream, and love it! Absorbs quickly, clean scent, and my skin didn't feel greasy after using"
I use this as a moisturizer at night because it doesn't have spf. It works really well and doesn't irritate my skin. The only problem is I have to use two pumps to cover my whole face.
"Burt's Bees Daily Moisturizing Cream was very refreshing! It glides right on your skin. Your skin feels great after applying, not too heavy like other creams."
Burts Bees is one of my favorite brands of all time. Their quality is top notch. Their products feel so luxurious. This item did not disappoint. The smell was great and the feel was awesome.
"I highly recommend this for someone like me who has oily, sensitive, and pore-filled skin. This moisturizer gave me no redness or aching burn like some other moisturizers I have used from other brands. It took away the oil from my skin. My skin felt softer and it looked brighter after using it. I've been using this moisturizer for about four months and I love it!!"
"I have oily, acne prone skin. It's also highly sensitive. So it can be a juggling act trying to find a product that addresses both issues at once. This does. It doesn't clog my pores and cause breakouts, even with a full face of make-up on. It's very light and has no noticeable scent. It hasn't irritated my skin even a little bit! It's fantastic and would recommend it to anyone!"
I have acne prone skin. This is the perfect mix of hydration and gentleness to keep my skin hydrated and feeling smooth. I apply the product twice a day to my face and have not had any problems wth dry skin since using the daily moisturizing cream. Love knowing that it is natural and I'm not putting harmful chemicals on or into my body. Well worth it!
"This has been the only moisturizer I have put on my face for the last five years. I've used other pricey moisturizers in the past, but they never worked as well as BB. My skin is sensitive to basically everything, so it made sense to put something completely natural on my face. I tried BB and haven't looked back. Don't let the small pump fool you; you won't need a lot because the lotion is THAT good."
"I wasn't sure how I would like this product. I am very, very picky about what goes on my face. I also have extremely oily skin. However, once I tried this product, I instantly knew it would work for me. It is non-greasy. It leaves my face feeling moisturized without feeling overdone. My face is less oily when I use this product. I am pleased. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have recently purchased this product and so far I am really enjoying it. I have sensitive skin and it has not irritated it at all. A little bit goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone. Even if you don't have sensitive skin. It is a great moisturizer.
Started using this cr√®me about 2 months ago and realized my husband has been using it also. We both have noticed a different in the dry spots on our faces especially under the eyes. We both use it on a daily basis. It doesn't feel greasy and goes right into the skin. Looks like I will have to buy 2 at a time now :) love this cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the only moisturizer I have found that does not make me break out. It has calmed down my sensitive, dry, flaky, oily skin so much. I do wish is was a little thicker as I find I need to layer it in order to get the right amount of moisture. I never want to be without this product so please never stop making it!"
"I was excited to purchase this product especially because it was for sensitive skin. I have been using it for a week and it makes my face so oily and shiny using it alone and with the application of my foundation. I have dry skin and thought it would help, but ended up too oily and it made my face break out. The areas where I broke out feels tingly. I will not be applying any longer and hoping my face clears up before the weekend."
"My face was extremely dry and flaky when winter started, even before. I also had acne but it cleared up. When using this product my skin began to feel natural and not dry it really did help me feel normal. And the best was that it didnt causse breakouts. Pros: no scent,no breakouts, nno worries!"
"Love how this product feels light on my face. Even in high humidity my skin feels great. I had a problems with redness and blotchy skin, but since I have been using Sensitive Daily Moisturizing cream my skin has cleared up, even tone. Just a wonderful product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have extremely oily, sensitive skin. This moisturizer does go on a little heavy for my oily skin, but absorbs really well. My face can go hours now without looking like an oil slick. Which is an amazing improvement. And it doesn't irritate my face. If the feel is just too heavy for my fellow users with oily skin, just dip your fingers in water and mix with the moisturizer before applying to your face."
"I love this stuff. It feels so lightweight, but my skin doesn't feel or look dry at all during the day after using it. It doesn't even leave my skin looking oily, which I've just put up with when using other moisturizers. The only thing I want is a bigger bottle of it. I love BB's environmentally friendly message and standards, but small bottles means more bottles being disposed of."
"I recently got this moisturizer. This was the best product I have ever used. When I put it on it was like god had finally reached me(no offence). Never in my life have I felt so at peace. I now carry this moisturizer everywhere I go, I show it to everyone and have them feel my skin. It is my pride and joy. The texture is like that of summery silk."
"I love this moisturizer. It is fragrance free and doesn't sting or burn. I use it after the Burts Bees sensitive face wash. My only problem is the redesign of the pump. The formula didn't change, but this new pump clogs easily and then squirts everywhere!"
"I have very sensitive skin that breaks out very easily. Before trying this I was using Lanc√¥me night cream that was more than $200 a jar because it was the only thing that didn't cause breakouts. This stuff works just as well at less than 10% of the price. It goes on easily and doesn't feel greasy or make my face shiny. Not too heavy but really moisturizes. Thanks, Burt's Bees!"
"I really wanted to love this product being that is made specifically for sensitive skin. After the first week of using the product I broke out terribly with acne, then after that first week of use it started to cause a burning sensation. The pump design isn't the greatest for controlling how much product comes out. Sometimes you need to press down a few times before anything comes out. I do love other Burt's Bees products, but this one is just not for me."
"Nice, clean feeling moisturizer that soaked into skin quickly and had no greasiness. No scent, no residue; just soft skin."
I found this moisturizer to be gentle to my skin and moisturized well. I did not find it to be very exciting though. It is rather plain. It does its job but not much more.
"I loved this moisturizer because it was light, easy to apply, and not greasy. The container was even handy in that it was to use and easy to apply on the go!"
"Burt's bees is my go to for organic body products. I love them. This moisturizer feels great on my face and doesn't get greasy or make me break out. Its so gentle, my 11 yr old also uses it."
It moisturizes my face when it is dry throughout the day.You can use it daily and it's great to use on sensitive skin.I would recommend this to my family and friends!
This is my new favorite moisturizer. I received a sample of it in a Walmart Beauty Box. I will definitely go out and purchase a full size. It's the first product I've found that didn't bother my skin AND my eyes.
"I have sensitive skin, and my beauty routine is very simple. I tried a sample of this moisturizer, and I loved the feel of it on my face. The results were fantastic, too!"
This cream went on very nicely and felt good on my face. It's soaked in which is always a good sign because I have dry skin and so it moisturized it I would definitely buy it when I need some more cream and I do recommend it
I bring this with me whenever I travel. I love the soft texture on my face; it's not tacky and my skin can breathe. It's mild and gentle and good to use everyday.
"I didn't get this in my box but I did buy it. It really helped moisturize my face, I have very sensitive skin and most affect my skin in a bad way but not this"
"Love Burt's Bees products. This just made my must buy list. It is very light, but keeps my skin moisturized. It has no scent. A small dab will do, less is more!"
I do not have sensitive skin but I did enjoy using Burt's Bees Daily Face Moisturizer Cream - it was soft and smooth and made me feel good about the product. I will be purchasing a larger size in the future.
"Easy use pump for just the right amount. Loved how this moisturizer made my skin feel! Lightweight,doesn't feel greasy,and my skin feels hydrated. Will definitely buy again."
This product makes my skin feel like I was 25 again. I love it no matter the cost. I will find something else like food or meds just to have this in my bathroom.
"I keep this in my purse now as my ""out & about"" emergency moisturizer. It's light but effective enough to cover/moisturize my dry splotches due to eczema."
I love this product. I have sensitive skin and many products cause acne break-outs. This is the only face lotion that I have found that doesn't cause break-outs. I have been acne free for a year now because I switched to this product.
I usually only by burts bees for my chapstick but I absolutely loved this product and will buy it again.
"Not greasy, natural & absorbs great. Good consistency & was easy to smooth on my face. No over powering smell. Felt good on my skin."
My skin is super sensitive and this moisturizer was super soothing! A little goes a long way and I would definitely use again!
"I enjoy majority of Burt's Bees moisturizers for lips, face, and skin because I have sensitive skin and these don't break me out."
I have rosacea and eczema on my face and have spent tons of money looking for the right cream that won't irritate any of the skin conditions that I have and OMG I can't believe the results that I am having with this product...and sooo well priced!!!
"Very soothing, and really calmed the redness on my face. I didn't break out at all, and my skin feels protected throughout the day. It's hydrating without being greasy. I love that it's fragrance free - simply the best if you have sensitive skin!"
Moisturize your face so very well. Burts Bees can be depended on for great products and this is no exception. I received this in a Walmart Beauty Box and I am using the product. I do wish it had some spf but it is a good product.
This product goes and fine and smells good but does not soak in all the way.
it feels like I have something on my face and I don't like that feeling :(
"I was hoping it would be creamy, feel good on my face. It was actually very thin, there was no feeling of hydration even as little as 5-10 minutes after use. I will just use on my legs to get rid of it."
The worst face cream I have ever bought. It sprays out of the container and ends up on the counter. I can't tell if the cream is any good because it seems to lay on your skin and not absorb. Don't waste your money!!
"I have used Burt's Bees Daily Moisturizing Creme for Sensitive Skin for sometime and I used to like the product very much, but ever since the new packaging came around the product itself has changed. It used to be more of matt finish and would stay that way all day long, but this one is on the greaser side and tends to make the foundation look patchy towards the second half of the day. It doesn't not give me breakouts but sadly I am forced to look for other products."
"My ear eczema requires daily attention. I apply a liberal amount of Burt's Bees Sensitive Daily Moisturing Cream on the affected area in my ear. After waiting for a few minutes I can gently scrape off the layer of hardened skin. I then apply the cream again. It's cool, it doesn't burn, its soothing and very effective for this type of condition. I also use it my knuckles, ankles and knees when dry skin becomes irritated and itchy."
My daughter loves this lotion [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love burts bees products but this one didnt love me back. I have dry sensitive skin so when i saw it i decided to purchase it. It didnt contain much of a fragrance and it feel good when i applied but then after it absorbed my face felt really dry. So i applied alittle more and still nothing. Really dissapointed.
I recently became allergic to a high end moisturizing system designed for sensitive skin. I had used it for over 40 years. This is the first product in the Burt's Bees line that I tried. It did not irritate my skin so I am gradually introducing other products in the line. I gave it only 4 stars because the pump squirts out too much of the product and it takes a very long time to dry.
"My face doesn't tolerate a lot of products. It gets easily irritated and red with face washes and moisturizers. I haven't had this problem with this moisturizer, it really is for sensitive faces. I use it in the morning and evening and no problem at all. The only downside is that I usually tend to reapply because my face doesn't feel moisturized enough, sometimes some dry patches remain and there is so little quantity in the bottle that I can go through one purchase in less than a month."
"I've been using this for almost a year and it's great! Not oily, no smell, and it absorbs into my skin within seconds. My skin is fairly picky with what it will do well with and this moisturizer has continually proven itself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although this said it was for sensitive skin, my face began burning minutes after I applied it. I looked at the ingredients and there is nothing in it that I know I'm allergic to, so I'm not certain why this occurred. I washed it off with a mild soap and relegated the ""daily moisturizing"" cream to the garbage can."
"I have very, very sensitive skin and have tried dozens of products that made my face break out.... This one is Great and leaves no redness on my skin... I would tell anyone with sensitive skin to use this... Also it has no odor ... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer did not disappoint. It is nongreasy, moisturizes well,for both day and night."
"I highly recommend it,and will buy it!"
"My skin is very sensitive so when I find a lotion that I can put on without any initial redness, I'm sold!"
I absolutely love this product. I put it on every time I walk past my vanity. So smooth and not oily.
"I don't have sensitive skin, but I did really like this moisturizer. It wasn't heavy, but really made my skin feel good."
I really liked this moisturizer it was not greasy or heavy on my face. Great for sensitive skin and like all of Burt's Bees it smells clean.
"Light, fresh scent. Absorbs quickly. Not greasy. My skin is very sensitive and breaks out easily however I had no problems with this product."
I really like the feel of the product. It made my face feel moisturized without adding a ton of product.
Very thin moisturizer. Not very hydrating but does sink into the skin quickly. I have normal skin. This certainly will not work for dry skin at all.
Love this! Gental for your face. Great smell. I am a fan of Burt's Bees products so I was excited to receive this sample.
I loved the smell and the feel but did nothing for moisturizing. Left my arms as dry as they were before.
I personally loved this product! It was full of nutrients to soften the skin. Totally would buy this.
"I LOVE organic and good brands for me. Ones without anything in them that would harm my skin, I love that so much!!! Their brand is the best!"
Burt's Bees makes quality products and they did not skimp on this moisturizer. It's soft and creamy but not greasy! The scent is light! Love it
"This stuff feels wonderful on my face! Love the smooth texture and it's not a bit oily, it sinks right into my skin."
I noticed a difference after a few uses. I would definitely buy again but if you have really dry skin I wouldn't recommend.
"Loved this moisturizer so much that I bought it! Super light weight, leaves skin feeling hydrated without being oily!!"
I used it on my face just a few time but it left it feeling moist and lasted longer than I expected.
"This is the best over the counter, non sunscreen moisturizer I have tried. Did not leave me greasy or dry. Highly recommend!"
I like the lightweight feeling on my face. It is a good product for those looking for a nice light moisturizer
"This moisturizer was ok, went on smoothly. But did feel a little bit greasy on my skin."
"Light and moisturizing, I liked knowing I was using good quality natural ingredients on my face."
Not greasy at all. You can feel it's moisturizing as you're putting it on.
"I loved this product. Non-greasy, absorbed quickly and made my skin feel very soft."
"I really like this moisturizer. It's not greasy, goes on easy, and smells good too."
"This was a good all around wholesome moisturizer it was good, I like all natural products."
I have very sensitive skin and this product was incredible! A must buy!
"Went on smooth, not greasy!"
Skin felt fantastic.
Really liked the pump container no waste
excellent product like all of Burts Bees items. Cant get enough of this.
Burt's bee daily moisturizing cream is great. It leaves my skin soft and hydrated.
Moisturizer leaves skin feeling skin soft and moist. Great moisturizer to wear under makeup.
Love this cream. It's creamy not greasy and smells so nice. Leaves skin feeling so soft
Excellent product all around. Loved the way it felt on my face.
The moisturizer felt heavy and didn't really make my face feel good.
Very light and non greasy. Did not irritate my sensitive skin. Likely to purchase again.
"My only complaint is the packaging, it's hard to get out and much gets wasted"
Burt bees is a natural brand n this moisturizer really helped my skin keeping it supple and healthy
"This is a light moisturizer, great for sensitive skin and use in summer"
Wonderful lightweight everyday moisturizer. Loved it! Perfect for oily skin.
I have very sensitive skin .This product made my skin feel soft and supple .
Burt's Bees always has great quality products! Absolutely LOVE this Moisturizer!
Some products good but keep getting face mask and inexpensive cosmetic bag
Very natural moisture. Like how the dispenser worse so you get just the amount you want.
Feels nice. Good for sensitive skin. There's no strong smell feels smooth and hydrating ‚ô•Ô∏è
Not sticky or greasy. Goes on so easily. Smells great.
I love anything that's Burt's Bees! Their products are amazing!!!
I love Burt's Bees products. This one has a nice texture and is very smooth.
Love this light face moisturizer and so glad it has spf.
Very good product not greasy or staining of the clothes very light weight product
This is a nice moisturizer..very emollient..not greasy in the least..great
I've always been a Burt's Bees fan but having a sensitive line makes me more of a fan.
not greasy moisturizes nicely worked well on my sensitive skin
I love Burt's Bees products! Easy to use and natural ingredients!
This lotion was a good addition to the Beauty Box. I used it up and wanted to purchase more.
I love the way my skin feels with this moisturizer!
This seemed to work well on my skin. My skin isn't sensitive but still it helped it.
The only face cream that I found that doesn't break my face out even the sensitive ones.
I really wanted to love this product because of the natural ingredients and no parabens. However it feel like it just sits on my skin rather then soaking in. I've used it off and on again and everytime I use it I break out.
I was looking for moisturizer and saw this one and decided to give it a try. I love it! It absorbs quickly into my skin and I don't break out because of it. That's a win for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I saved so much!!
"I have been using this product from 2013 and I am really happy that finally there is a cream which doesn't irritate my sensitive combination skin. As I am sensitive to few fragrances, I wanted a fragrance free cream and the best part is that it is. I use it twice in winter and at night in summers. Love Burts Bees. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a redhead with the most sensitive skin, especially my face. I was always trying a different facial moisturizer, but could not find the perfect one. But I found this one, glad to see it specified for ""sensitive"" skins. It's not oily and doesn't feel like it's clogging my pores. A little goes a long way. You can hardly tell it's even on. This has become my favorite Burt's Bees product yet. And it has ingredients that I am familiar one (and can pronounce)! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
LOVE. I have acne prone skin that is extremely sensitive. This moisturizer is the perfect consistency and wears well by itself or under makeup. Does not sting around eyes or in dry/sensitive spots. No harsh smells. Will continue to repurchase! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"its been very difficult to find a moisturizer thats light and fragrance free because of my age and my sensitive face. But i found the holy grail... This Cream! its amazing, light, natural, and it lets my skin breathe! I just wish there was more in the bottle :("
All my life I have had sensitive skin and at almost 55 years old I have found a moisturizer that works beautifully! No more redness and my skin is plump and beautiful. I have never been so pleased with a skin product as much as I am with this product. I hardly have to wear any makeup anymore. It's amazing!
"After many attempts, it was wonderful to find a sensitive skin care set that did what it was supposed to and was so gentle. Because of the result, I purchased the entire set and have started to use more Burt's Bee products. Please continue to produce this and don't change a thing. It is perfect for sensitve skin."
"I was looking for a less costly moisturizer than the one I was using, so I decided to try this since I have adult acne and sensitive skin. Practically everything makes me break out. I also wanted to go natural as well, so I figured I'd try this. This is a great moisturizer, not greasy, does not clog your pores, or at least mine and does not irritate your face at all. Since I love this, they'll probably discontinue it though! :)"
Doesn't moisturize my face that well. Wish it was thicker.
Love this moisturizer. Great for morning and night. Also love the fact that it is mostly natural!!!
Light feeling lotion. Good moisterizer. Lighty scented.
I use this twice a day and it makes my skin GLOW it's lovely
Amazing love it i feel like it really moisuarizes without making my face red and its natural AMAZING!!!
I have very sensitive skin and can't use many products on my face. This is a life saver. I use it twice a day and my skin is soft and smooth. Thank you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Best face moisturizer I've used in years. The ingredients are great. None of that stuff that stings your face like most moisturizers have now. Smooth, light, excellent!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Instead of saying what it DOES do, I am going to say what it DOESN""T do. It doesn't make my face break out, it doesn't make my nose run and my eyes water. It is a great prduct."
My main concern when purchasing a face lotion is reducing redness. I have dry and sensative skin that breaks out easy. This lotion is great. I've been using it for a few weeks and I have no redness and no acne. It's lightweight and if I need a little more mosturizing I add a couple drops of the Complete Nourishment Facial Oil to the lotion and it works great.
"I have always suffered from red, splotchy cheeks. After using the Sensitive daily facial cleanser and now the daily moisturizing cream my skin looks SO much better! The lotion absorbs quickly, is nice and light on my skin and is NOT GREASY! Will definitely be buying this product consistently!"
"I have sensitive, combination skin and have had reactions to other face moisturizers but this one is perfect. It has no scent and leaves my skin feeling plump and moisturized all day! I will not use anything else now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how my skin drinks this up and really soothes my skin. It seems to look better moments after I have put it on. I will say I prefer it as a night cream as to using it in the day--I have pretty dry skin. It feels a little too heavy to wear under make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got two of these as I have sensitive skin type and hardly I find a product to like. It works! It didn't irritate me, nor left me with greasy feeling or skin, and it made my skin smooth and soft. It absorbs quickly, just as I want! It has a fluid, light consistency and the smell is not bothering.I like the fact that it has a pumping recipient so that no hair or dirt gets inside whatsoever. I think I'll stick to it!"
"I had the worst luck moisturizing my skin, trying to find a balance of what skin care and make up would work for me because my skin is acne pron due to the fact it is sensitive. I battled mild acne for years until now. FINALLY! I use the day and night moisturizers, sensitive skin cleanser in the morning and the acne solutions scrub every night - found if I dont exfoliate daily my black heads are never under control. PERFECTION!"
"I do not have sensitive skin, but I decided to try this out because I don't care for the radiance line. I also tried a sample of the carrot moisturizer at a store once and didn't care for that either. This is a great lightweight moisturizer.You don't need a huge amount either. I usually lean toward heavier moisturizers, but this still keeps my skin hydrated all day. My only negative is that I wish it had sunscreen in it."
"This moisturizing cream is a dream for me. Despite having mature skin, I still have trouble with many moisturizers because I have oily skin. I love this cream because it leaves my skin feeling smooth without any oily residue. I would recommend this excellent cream to anyone who needs hydration without any kind of oil or residue. Thank you, Burt's Bees for a wonderful product."
"If you use this you will never regret it. I was scared when I first tried it, I have incredibly sensitive skin and everything irritates it except for this line. I do sometime get breakouts but not since using this cream. I just wish the container was larger."
"I received some samples of this as part of a BzzAgent Campaign. Like the cleanser, it is thick and creamy with a nice, light scent. The moisturizing cream is rather thick for a facial moisturizer and a little hard to rub in. It does seem to soften the lines in my neck, but I prefer to use it as a hand cream."
I was given a sample of this product to review as a buzz agent. I loved the simple goodness of this moisturizer. It is all natural and did not cause my skin to sting and burn. It provided moisture for my skin all day long. I go without makeup alot and my skin was healthy and glowing while using the Sensitive Daily Moisturizing Cream. My brother in law usually cannot use a moisturizer because it will cause his face to become red and inflamed but he was able to use the Sensitive Daily Moisturizer with no redness at all!
"First, I appreciate the decent price of this product. I have sensitive skin and cannot use anything with dyes or perfumes on my skin. This moisturizer does a great job and has not caused me any breakouts! There is no scent and the product is a nice creamy-white. It has been a very dry summer in TX and this has kept my skin looking great. I highly recommend this for girls with sensitive skin."
"Very creamy, yet light. My previous product was Mary Kay; I figure if I'm spending the money anyway, I'd like to know what ingredients I'm putting on my face (which MK doesn't allow). I would have given this product 5 stars except it doesn't come with SPF. The non-sensitive version DOES come with SPF. This makes very little sense to me. Overall, great product. Would recommend."
I love this product. It's great for my gluten sensitive skin. It moisurizes well and I have not broken out from it like I do most moisturizers. I have tried the sensitive skin eye cream-not my favorite-it doesn't moisturize at all. I use straight up almond oil instead or with the eye cream to get the moisture I need. I also use this with the acne face wash and toner. They work great together.
chose because natural safe ingredients and for sensitive skin been using a long time
"I use this moisturizer everyday after an acne wash. It is perfect even for people with oily skin like myself, doesn't make you look shiny."
"so soft and smooth on, smells great and made me feel good without and problem with sensitivity [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love it! It really works! After about a week I could see fantastic results! I recommend it to everyone who has very sensitive skin! :)
"Other moisturizers have come and gone, and i find myself returning to BB Sensitive. Love the natural ingredients, but even more love the great things it does for my skin."
"I really like this moisturiser, it sinks into the skin very quickly when applied. It's moisturing for my acne prone skin and does not make my skin oily."
"I was disappointed I couldn't get the Ageless day lotion, but I'm liking this one just as much. Although I did love the light fragrance of the Ageless. I have sensitive skin and this one works great too."
Its really difficult for me to find products that won't make my skin react harshly but this Sensitive Daily Moisturizer Cream has proven itself to be a keeper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It was a pleasant surprise to find a moisturizer that did not cause redness or break-outs. It goes on smoothly and does a good job. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My daughter has some real issues with perfumes in products, and this moisturizer is perfect for her. Moisture without clogging the pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"With my very sensitive skin, I was reluctant to try a new moisturizer (especially one that is so expensive). However, I did not experience any problems with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love how this product feels light on my face. Its a great summer moisturizer when you don't want heavy product. Didn't cause any reactions whatsoever. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Instantly calms my skin after a hot shower. The redness fades after a few minutes and my face has not felt dry once since I've started using it! I pair it with the sensitive night cream.
I was having trouble with a shiny face and breaking out. This moisturizes without shine and doesn't irritate. Makeup goes on smooth and doesn't look as blotchy.
Makes my face super soft! Its very lightweight & gentle. Smells good. Way better than any of the brand name store products I've always used! I'll never go back to the others!
"To those of you saying there's no SPF, it may not be much, but it does say Zinc Oxide in the ingredients which is a type of SPF and for people like me who break out.....we cannot have SPF in our moisturizers. Read the labels guys!"
Received samples of this while ice skating in Ottawa Ontario - Love the product. It was great in the cold weather. Really like the way it absorbs into my skin no greasy feel to the product!
This product works great and does all it promises to do. My only issue was that I could feel it on me and it left my skin looking very dewy. Some people like that dewy look but I prefer to look matte.
"I love this moisturizer. It is a good consistency--not too thick or thin. And the best part is, my skin has not had any problems switching to this moisturizer. I only wish that it had SPF in it to wear as a daily moisturizer."
"I got Burts Bees Sensitive Skin Facial Moisturizer to try for free as a bzz agent, what I love about it is that it blends so well with my makeup. The product has a nice smell and goes on smoothly. I used the product for several days and had no issues with my sensitive skin. I love to buy this brand whenever I can because they are so environmentally friendly, but I?m disappointed that the moisturizer doesn?t have SPF in it. In this day and age I wont wear something for long if it does protect my skin from the suns rays."
have been using this for a few years now love it .
I have been using thei sof a long time great product and all natural
Why is this no longer available in stores and now it's not available on line either?
The best facial cream I ever used. Sensitive for the skin. Non greasy. odorless. Leaves face feeling revived & smooth all day
I saw a big difference in my skin after a few uses. Great for my sensitive skin!
Lightweight and comfortable for me to wear underneath makeup.
"This cream is so light, I don't even notice it under my makeup. my face feels great!"
Nice moisturizer for sensitive skin. Has nearly no scent. Not too heavy.
