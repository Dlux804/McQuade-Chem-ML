"I have allergies to coconut and palm, which is especially awful because even the hydrocortisone creams I find use them. This was the only one I could find that does not. I just used it the first time and it does feel less itchy. We will see how it does at clearing things up but even a little relief feels like a huge relief at this point."
my daughter has savere eczema and we have tried so many creams and lotions. i finally came accross this and was scepticle to pay the price of it. but for her i did. the first time we used it i was amazed as to how mush she loved it and how great her poor skin felt. huge bonus for not being super oily! the next few days we didnt use it but all her brigjt red spots were gone! she wasnt complaining about it itching or hurting her skin after one use had so much improvement i will never use anything else on her!
"Cera Ve never disappoints me! One more great product. I have to wash my hands frequently, so I can go through several washes without having to reapply this cream. It doesn't cure eczema but it helps sooth and it feels better on the skin than anything else I have tried so far. I like that it is non greasy and fragrance free"
"I would give more stars if possible....I have super sensitive, combination skin and get an allergic rash from just about every product I've tried. I love the oils, hyaluronic acid, and ceramides present in this lotion and use it as a replacement for my face lotion as well. My skin is definitely more hydrated and supple....with no rash...Thank you!"
I went through what seemed like every eczema relief product available and my hands still cracked and peeled for over a year. I used this one for a month and my hand was almost completely healed. After a 4 months my hands have stayed completely heeled. I am actually grateful.
"I absolutely love this product. My skin is very dry and very sensitive and this is my go-to body lotion. It has a unique texture that I haven't experienced in other body lotions (creamy oil is definitely the best way to describe it) but I personally love it and find it to feel luxurious and highly moisturizing. I use it right after the shower on just towel dried skin. It has no added fragrance but has a pleasant natural scent. As usual for Cera Ve, the ingredient list is very impressive for the price-point. Highly recommend."
I love this product. I've been going through laser hair removal treatments and was taking a toll on my skin. This lotion has restore my skin to even better than it was before my treatments. Super soft skin and absorbs into skin to produce a healthy glow. Will be a staple in my home for a long time.
"Smells good. Feels good on the skin. But the consistency Iâm not a fan of, I dont like how watery it is when it comes out and then you end up using/wasting more than you need"
"i was very excited to try this produce since i love a number of other CeraVe products, however i was very disappointed. I was hoping to relieve the itchiness of my eczema in addition to moisturizing the skin, this product did nothing remotely close to that. The creamy oil consistency was new to me, however it doesn't absorbs well and sits on top of the skin for quite some time. The product did not relive the dryness, nor the itchiness. I would not recommend it to someone who is looking for an instant relief."
"I should say I do not have eczema.Neverless,I really like this lotion especially for dry,itchy winter skin.The ingredient list is outstanding.The texture is oily first but soaks in nicely.Always want this in my arsenal."
"Love this product and how thick it is, my 2 ye old has had eczema since she was 3 months old and we have tried countless lotions, creams, and steroids everything else made it worse. This is the 1st thing that doesn't burn when applied and cleared it up with out a worse flare up."
The price! Used for only a short time but I haven't noticed any difference between this and say lubriderm. It just costs a lot more!
"this product is very good for dry skin also,not greasy.you only need to use a small amount."
I have tried all kinds of moisturizers and this one actually helped my dry sensitive skin
"Its ineffective, goes on well but very little exfoliation. Not enough Ceramides in it or whatever."
