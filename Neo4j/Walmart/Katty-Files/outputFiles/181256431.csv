Works amazing. Skin became soft an smooth. Dove over night works an does what its suppose too. I cant help touch my face every morning! Lol [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed waking up to a smooth creamy feeling face. Before I used this product I would wake up with dry patches on my cheeks and a little spot under my right eye. I have been using this product for three weeks and I love it!
The over night cream is great cause one your not touching your face and it gets deep down in your pores and soothes and smooths the dryness making your your face refreshed love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
this Dove face cream works well on my face.I am using it every night and got My face moisturized and fresh.After few used a clear difference can be noticed.
Great product. My skin looks great! I will be glad to buy this product again.
"My face became quite dry over the last month. By the end of the day, my makeup would look horrible due to the dryness showing through. After only a few uses of this product, I have noticed a huge difference! My skin feels smooth, but not greasy. I will definitely be repurchasing, and using this as my go to!"
"This is the best moisturizer I have found for my dry skin. My skin feels so calm and smooth after using it. Not greasy! Not sticky! Please don't stop making this stuff! It's a wonderful product for people with dry skin. I use it in the morning under my makeup and at night after exfoliating and my skin just feels like normal calm skin. No more dry, tight, or flaky face for me."
"I have dry skin due to the dry winter season and thanks to Dove's face cream, my face haas been feeling moisturized. My face is not longer dry! The cream itself is not to oily of sticky, its replenishes and doesn't leave my face feeling greasy. I love this face cream and would recommend it!"
"This is such a good product! It really does make your skin feel ""Brand New"" not to mention the satyfying texture. Even the smell is not to bad. Kind of pleaseant really. I highly recomment this podcut for anyone looking for that New Look and Feel rejuvinated skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have always struggled with acne breakouts anytime I put something on my face. I'll be honest, I put this face cream on one night before bed fully expecting to have terrible acne the next morning but woke up to the softest skin and didn't have any acne from it! This stuff is so great!"
Only reason this isn't a 5 start is because I can't wear it every night. It makes my skin so hydrated! Down side is if you use it 2 nights in a row it started to make my face oily looking in some places. Over all this is the best face moisturizer I have ever used!!
"I like this because it doesn't burn my eyes. I use this product at night, and also during the day. So many foundations already have ample sunscreen in them, so that and with wearing a hat, I feel is ample protection."
Goes soft on skin. Doesnt make oily at the same time gives enough hydration. No reactions..no side effects.
this product is wonderful!!!! leave my skin radiant hydrated I look much younger I can use it without problems because it is not greasy and it smells very good I love it
"In my 50 years this is the first time I came across the product that wowed me after the first use. Lightweight, frangrance free and makes your skin feel and look healthy. I am simply amazed. Kudos Dove!"
This is a great lotion! It's odorless/scent-free and doesn't affect my allergies. It's not heavy feeling. You just put it on before end and wake up with a more refreshed look.
When I say the Dove Overnight Cream made my dehydrated skin so moisturized. When I woke up the next morning my skin was soft and glowing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The Dove DermaSeries Dry Skin Relief Overnight Face Cream is the perfect match for me! My skin is very difficult at times but with this cream I feel relief. I use it at night [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After I washed my face I would apply the night cream and with just one use I could feel a difference. And when I woke up my face still felt soft and clean feeling!!
This product was great. It really smooth and light. It has helped with my dry skin and evened out the tone. It's a lovely cream that feels like its caressing your face with moisture. Will have to buy product after sample runs out
My face feels more comfortable and softer then when i didn't have the over night cream. My face gets dry after i wash it and having the cream made my face better

After washing my face and putting on the dove overnight cream I noticed it has a very refreshing feeling. Thank you for the sample I would love to receive more dove sample products in the future.
