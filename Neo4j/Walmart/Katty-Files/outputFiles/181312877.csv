"I am 66 years old and love this product! I only wish the SPF was higher, but I simply put a SPF 50 sunscreen on underneath and then a primer and I'm good to go. It overs a decent amount of coverage but looks natural and doesn't settle into wrinkles."
"I bought this product last week. For years I struggled with a dry, blotchy complexion. I have felt that I needed to wear liquid foundation every day. Not now! This product is amazing! My complexion is smooth, and the product goes on velvety soft. Will never buy another moisturizer!"
"I really like this tinted moisturizer, but I wish it came in a lighter color because this one is too dark for my skin tone. Besides that itâs light, refreshing, and it looks very natural. It helps disimulate the redness on my skin caused by rosacea. I still recommend it."
I love the texture and coverage. It is creamy but absorbs nicely. It leaves the skin a little shinier than I like so use a little powder to tone down the shine. That I can deal with.
"I really do not like the shade of the tint though. If I am careful and blend really well, I can use it in the summer. In general, though, it is too dark and orange for my fair skin."
"I like how well this moisturizer works to cover the redness on my face, I layer it over another sunscreen with SPF-50. If it had a higher SPF I would wear it alone. It evens out my skin tone and is a great alternative to foundation on hot summer days or for those ""no-makeup"" days. I love that it's fragrance free, uses a mineral sunscreen and it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin and eyes. It has a very dewy finish so I apply a light layer of setting powder. Would definitely repurchase!"
"Love this as a moisturizer and spf in one with the tint. The whole concept of it is wonderful. I am a male in his 40's and love this and use the night redness moisturizer as well. On this The tint is good but I wish and they should probably reformulate or work in doing it with a green tint instead of neutral. Then it would be perfect, due to having it with a green tint it will go and blend with any color or skin tone of a person. Please please rework it.. but besides that it is great."
Good product. Leaves my face a little sticky but I think it's because of the sun screen it contains. It's a really good product though and I will continue to use it.
I love the actual product but the tint is top orange for my pale skin. Please add more color options!
"I love how this is like a 3-in-1. It has moisturizer, SPF, and acts like a BB cream. But, being on the paler side, I need a tint that actually compliments my skin tone. This does not do so and I wish it did. It is too dark and too orange for my skin tone."
"I bought this product hoping that it would be a moisturizer that had a light feel on my face but more importantly, a tint would match my complexion."
WOW!! I love this product!! Please do not ever discontinue it! I have replaced my expensive makeup with this tinted moisturizer and wear it daily. Thanks for a product that is affordable and that works!
"I started using this product about two months ago, it is the most wonderful thing and I use it now in place of any foundation. The tint on this product makes it a dual purpose product. I get the spf to protect my skin and the tint to cover blemishes and even skin tone. PLEASE make it available in a larger size. Great Job!"
"I love that this has physical sunblock and a tint. I get better coverage than I expected, too. It's not full coverage and I still need concealer on bad days but this blends effortlessly, looks natural, feels light, and my face feels soothed instead of irritated like some products with fragrances and chemical sunscreens tend to do. The only thing that would make this better is an SPF of 30 or higher. It does a nice job of making my chin and cheeks look less red, too."
"I bought this 2 months ago to hide redness around my nose from a cold. I put it all over my face with the cetaphil oil control moisturizer and it calmed my skins redness from acne as well. Recently, I've been having more cysts on my chin & this product takes away the redness & helps to conceal them as they heal. 10/10 recommend"
The very best I have ever had. Its so perfect. The tint is perfect -the formula is not oily. It goes on smooth and looks perfect under foundation. I use a foundation stick after applying this moisturizer to the face. I spot conceal with the foundation stick by clinique called the nude foundation stick and I am out the door. Please never discontinue this product. I just LOVE it.
"I only use mineral sunscreens because my skin is sensitive to chemical filters. The one I use on my face is SPF 50 and leaves a faint, white cast so I layer the Cetaphil tinted sunscreen over it. I don't wear this one alone because the SPF is only 20, hence 4 stars instead of 5. However it has a nice texture, is fragrance free and is a great alternative to foundation during the hot summer months. I also like that it's mineral based and doesn't irritate my skin or eyes. It has a dewy finish so I apply a light layer of setting powder on top."
"My skin is the most sensitive there is. I even have a reaction to my tears! Bc of this, I have to be VERY cautious of what I put on my skin. No fragrance, dyes,"
Not as good as the nighttime moisturizer and requires a little extra effort to get smoothed out and even looking. But does help blend out some of the redness
"As a longtime Cetaphil facial cleanser user, I had high hopes for this product. The cream itself is wonderful, but sadly the tint is too orange. Sadly I had to return it."
"Love this product...Great color, good coverage and moisturizing but not greasy at all. I've tried a lot of drugstore and high end tinted spf /moisturizers and this is by far the best. Hope it never gets discontinued. It's such a great product."
Okay I bought this moisturizer said it had a neutral tent but for us paler people the tent is orange other than that it is a good moisturizer I just wish they would make a letter tint or make it without a tint
Wonderful product. Have always been hesitant to apply lotion to face; it would cause my face to become redder and shiny. Has a great tone balance and feels great
My skin is prone to blemishes. This lotion has replaced my moisturizer AND my foundation. My skin looks natural and beautiful covered with one product.
Good product i use the entire line of redness prone skin. I dont wear any makeup on my skin because i have rosacea and the tint make my face look a little off in color... please please please make this product without the tint.
"Beautiful, tan tint. Not irritating. Soothing. Few ingredients. All mineral. Creamy. LOVE IT!"
"because of a bit of tint, this gives a nice appearance of a light foundation. nice"
I bought this a few days ago and my skin looks super healthy and flawless!!!! Super love !!!<3
It leaves my face feeling soft and hydrated. It never makes my face feel oily or gross.
This product didn't work in my skin breakouts my skin bad reaction to it
"Please note this is tinted, it wasn't listed in the heading and I guess I didn't read the product details before ordering. The only redness reduction I've noticed is just the color covering up the red, not what I was hoping for by ""redness relieving """
This product is light and smooth and provides great coverage. I have used many products from drug store brands to the more expensive brands and this is my all time favorite. I have oily skin towards the end of the worlk day and my foundation is normally breaking down this stuff will last me all day with no breaking down.
"I am always searching for a lightly tinted moisturizer so that I don't have to use foundation. This one so far works for me. I purchased it just to see if it would reduce some of the redness in my face and for that I would only say it sort of does the job. It is light coverage and I would say it really does not ""cover"" the red. I am hoping it will eventually reduce the redness in my face with continued use."
"I'm so disappointed! I am a fair skinned woman with rosacea and previous skin cancer. I need sunscreen and hoped the neutral tint would help cover my rosacea. I so wish it came with more tint choices, rather than just one, which does not blend with my skin tone. Also, the expiration date is Jan. 2019, only 6 months away, rather than the usual 3 years!"
"I have a fragrance allergy and sensitive skin, and need an affordable fragrance free mineral sunscreen with a tint. I was happy to discover this one, it looks nice on my skin and I like the shade of the tint. I wish it had a higher SPF, but I layer it over another sunscreen with SPF 30."
"This product does NOT make me break out like most. It does not make my face greasy. And it does not have that powdery effect where a powder finish makes every hair, wrinkle, and pore more prominent. Looooove this product and one pump goes a long way. I will never switch, I used to use Clinique before this and this one is THE ONE!"
"Love it, can't live without it! Use it in my daily morning routine as a moisturizer / make up."
Love this product if you're suffering from rosacea it covers it up
"Great texture not too heavy, actually matched my skin color without looking heavy."
I love this tinted moisturizer! It evens out my red skin tone and I don't even need foundation.
