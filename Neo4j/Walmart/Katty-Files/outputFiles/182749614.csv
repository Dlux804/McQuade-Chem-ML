"Love love love. Not only do you get half priced item on jet but this moisturizer is amazing. I struggle with dry skin, acne prone and lack of elasticity. In one week I've seen major improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Have been using this for a while, the product is great. But the price here is amazing! I was about to change to something cheaper when I found this - it's the same product, but around $30 less than other sites. It was delivered quickly, well-packaged, and I saved $$! Win Win!"
This is the best facial moisturizer with SPF 30! It is light and goes on smoothly.
What a great skincare product ! It works! Fell in love after the first week of use!
Love the way this feels and performs. Highly recommend it.
"I have no doubt that ulitmate miracle worker does all that it claims to do. I love philosophy products, especially multi-taskers. My skin felt great the first time I used this product. HOWEVER, my allergies acted up almost immediately when I used this product. The perfume in it is so strong it made my eyes water and my sinuses swell. I sneezed for a good twenty minutes after I applied it. This is not the product for me, or for anyone who is sensitive to perfume. Try again philosophy. This one is a miss."
