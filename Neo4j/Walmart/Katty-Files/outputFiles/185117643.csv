"The product sent to me by AMI Ventures Inc. was not the one pictured (blue jar) in their ad that I ordered. I got the newer/revised product (white jar), which I did not want since it contained a very strong scent. The blue jar night cream was still the original product, which barely had a scent. I search all over the internet to find the original product and I thought I found it here. Not! Cannot return beauty products according to AMI Ventures Inc. policy. So am out about $15. Very unhappy customer."
