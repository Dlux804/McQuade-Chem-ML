"I love this hydrating moisturizer. It's light but packs a punch and my skin feels quenched. I have super dry skin and this is the only cream that I have found that makes me skin feel great, moisturized without feeling heavy or clogged. I also love that you can find it on Walmart.com for less than the $45 you have to spend normally."
