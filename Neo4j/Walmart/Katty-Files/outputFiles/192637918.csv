"I have been using this sunscreen product for years on my extremely sensitive face. Works well as a sunscreen and facial cream, causes no skin irritation or break outs. Love it! It is difficult to find in stores but here it is at Walmart and for a very competitive price."
I've only been using the defense lotion for a couple of weeks but I do like it. A little goes a long way! Also received the lotion four days before it was scheduled to arrive which was surprising and great.
