The cream goes on very smooth and feels good to the skin. Takes about two weeks to notice improvement.
makes my skin look and feel great [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I ran out of my usual serum so I decided to raid my mom's makeup case. I saw this bad boy and decided to give it a try and i'm glad that I did! It made my skin feel so soft and it made my tinted moisturizer and makeup go on like a dream, and I didn't use Primer with it. I personally don't have any dark spots but my mother says it greatly helped out her's a lot. I can't recommend this enough and it's now part of my daily skin care!"
I bought this for my daughter after doing some research on this product. She is using it for her dark spots from acne is noticing some fading already.
"I both this product approximately 3 weeks ago. The results are amazing. At age 70, I have been distraught about the dark under eye circles. Using this product morning and night since purchase has made a remarkable difference. I feel and look 10 years younger. Wish I had a before and after photo for proof. The only product that worked for me, even above and beyond products I spent $90 on for a lesser amount. Thank you L'Oreal. Kathy from Texas"
Please! Please! Bring this product back. I have had bad acne all my life. I have spent countless dollars on other products and dermatologist. A friend recommended this product and within weeks my face cleared up. Now I am unable to find this product and I am breaking out really bad.
I have been using this product for about 3 months and I have noticed a huge improvement with my skin tone. I am 46 years old and I still have mild acne which sometimes leave dark spots on myface. This serum corrects those blemishes and leave my skin looking great. Love it!
I purchased this product in hopes to even or my skin tone and to help with my dark spots. I used it every morning and night for 4 weeks and did not notice a change at all. I was highly unsatisfied and expected a much better product especially for the price.
"I purchased this product in store and used it for six weeks until I had finished the bottle of serum. I saw absolutely no improvement or change in my skin or dark spots on my face. I would not recommend purchasing this product, it was deeply disappointing and way to expensive for something that didn't deliver on what it promised."
"I bought this product over a month ago. I am slowly seeing results, but as much sun damage as my face has, I'm pleased with the product. The dark spots from my years of tanning and burning at the beach have shown on my face for years. As I get older it has become more noticeable. I am starting to see a slight difference in my skin and I like the smell as well."
"I wrote a question asking if this is discontinued before reading the previous comments to see it was already answered. Please come back!! i have tried other creams and they all do not work as well! this product was perfect. perfect feeling, cured my dark spots, smelled perfect, didn't feel thick. Im extremely disappointed its gone!"
"I've been using this Dark Spot Serum for awhile now, and I have some stubborn dark spots on my face. It does give me a glow like, but have not seen anything fading on the spots yet. I will continue and see how it goes, as for another reviewer, who mentioned the smell. I have severe allergies and the light smell doesn't effect me at all."
"I wouldn't waste your money if you are expecting L'Oreal Dark Spot Corrector Serum to correct, or even minimize dark spots. It does not. I have used the serum in conjunction with the cream for over two months, twice daily. Although it feels nice and I like the face cream, it was way to expensive to not have delivered on the advertising. Dark spots, absolutely no difference."
"Not greasy, easily applied. Use with or without other Youth Code products. I used for a month and noticed lightening of my age/sun spots. I also have oily skin in the summer and it did not make my skin feel greasy. The spots are not completely gone but less noticeable. Maybe in another month they will lighten more."
"I have used a doctor's full skin care system for diminishing dark spots on my face for a number of years. I chose to use this product now instead as my husband was not crazy about the continual peeling of my face. Molting again? he would ask me. Well, truth be told I am tired of the spontaneous peeling too, rather hard to deal with in a daily basis. I like this serum very much and have only been using it for a couple of weeks but I will definitely chose it again."
I have really bad acne therefore my face is highly covered with acne marks. I have tried EVERYTHING for a long period of time and finally I got what I really needed all this time. This product really works! plus is cheap and you can find it anywhere. I only have a few weeks using it and I have seen results already on my face.
"Used this product twice a day for six weeks and I can honestly say it did absolutely nothing at all, and especially in the way of treating or correcting any of the dark spots on my 72 year old face! Total waste of $17.98 ~~ money down the drain, so to speak!"
I have been battling acne well in my thirtys and I had some blemishes that I wanted to clear up and I started with something different and it didn't work as well and when I switched to loreal spot corrector and the Sun screen it did wonders for my skin and I swear by it.
Good product and a great price through Jet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This serum improved my skin. I have brighter and clearer skin within 2 weeks!
I love this stuff and it's not easy to find. So happy to get it here on Jet and delivery was very quick.
Very light non greasy miracle serum. It will speed the recovery time of any blemishes you get. Excellent product to use daily.
This product worked extremely well for my acne scarring. In just a few weeks I began noticing my scars fading and some disappeared. Absolutely Love this product and will continue to buy it!!
"I bought the Youth Code Dark Spot, because I read it had great reviews in a magazine. I had a dark spot that I was tired of seeing. Well, after a month it's about gone! I couldn't be happier! I tell everyone about it! Thank you!"
Love this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
You have nothing to lose but those aggravating lines :)
"I wish I still had the receipt, because I'd return this. I've used it for over a month, and I have not seen ANY results! So I bought Neutrogena's Dark Spot Corrector, it's been less than a week, and I've seen results. But seriously, if you are going to spend a $20, buy the Neutrogena Dark Spot Corrector :)"
"I battled cystic acne for years and was left with a TON of scars on my cheeks. I've tried many products and was considering having a chemical peel but decided to try this first. Within one week my scars were dramatically faded and I was wearing less makeup. I'm continuing to see improvement. I use it at night and in the morning, without moisturizer because I have oily skin. It doesn't cause my makeup to smear like some other products. Another huge pro: it doesn't stain my white pillow cases!"
I have counter top full of failed dark spot products. This is the only effective product so far. LOVE the results.
I bought this 3weeks ago and I love it. It brighten up my skin day by day and smells really good. The best part is affordable and does a great job.
"From friend's recommendation found this, really awesome. It feels like nothing on my skin and it brightens my skin too."
This product does nothing to eliminate dark spots. I've used it twice a day for over a month and there's been no difference.
I noticed a huge difference. Please make this product easier to get!!! I love it. I don't want to start searching again for another product!
"I love this product ! It makes your skin feeling nice and after weeks of using it you'll have a healthy,beautiful and young skin on your face !!"
I have bad acne and I needed something that would correct my tone and this made t he cut [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Helped reduce my dark spots when used 2x a day. Try it!
"I love this serum!! I have been using the Dark Spot Correcting Day Cream for about 2 months now. Although I have not seen any obvious improvement on my dark spots yet, but my skin has been glowing! Last week I decided to give this serum a try, on top of the day cream to see if it would help. I fell in love with it, it's very moisturizing, light weight, and smooth. :)"
"I have tried so many products to fade my dark spots on my face. I wish I had tried this sooner, it would have saved me a lot of money. I am 43, hispanic with dark spots on my cheeks for over 5 yrs now. They got worse during pregnancy. I am so impressed with this product. They are not completly gone, but after two weeks of use I have high hopes that they will be gone in the near future."
"I have oily, sensitive and VERY easy to break out skin. I have tried very expensive products and I like quality. I received a sample and tried the Youth Code, I LOVE IT. I use the day/night and serum at night. Day I use only serum or day lotion as i am oily I don't want to use too much product. My skin looks fresh and glowy not shiny, not oily. It DOES NOT make me break out. (If anyone will break out it will be me), my skin is smooth w/ no break outs. I am 44 yrs old."
"Used as directed, twice a day for 4 weeks - - no result."
I bought this a couple of months ago and it works great i love it!!
I used the whole bottle and there was no change in anything
"I got this as a gift. I really love it, it really is working as it says it does!"
"I use this product daily works totally perfect, love it!"
I purchased this item on 1/22 and used it faithfully until it was gone and do not see any results. I'm not surprised that you don't have a money back guarentee!
"After using this product for a couple of weeks, I have been very impressed! My age/sun spots are fading! As an added bonus, my skin is glowingly beautiful. (PS: I use this in addition to the RevitaLift line.)"
I purchased this product even though I couldn't afford it because loreal is supposed to have great products. I was unbelievable disappointed to find that after using it religiously there were no visible results. Such a waste of money. I guess I should have expected it from a product that does not offer a money back guarantee.
Ive started using this when my day/nite cream = skin recharger but I have a lot of post acne marks but yet I don't see them getting reduced cause when I stand in front of the mirror I can see it as if I was leaning in on the counter close up to the mirror! Ive been using this since either Jan 2 or Jan 5th. But maybe I have to give it alittle bit longer to see the results. The only reason why I got this to try was the post acne marks. And I haven't seen any changes in my skin yet.
"This is a good product and definitely better than all other brands at this price point. I have sensitive skin, and Loreal products ALWAYS work for me. This one does not irritate my skin, although, it does leave my skin slightly pink after applying. It blends in well and doesn't make my skin oily or greasy feeling and maintains the softness that I try to keep. I gave it 4 stars because it doesn't completely erase dark spots, but it does give your skin a much softer appearance and improves the look overall."
"I bought it to lighten sun spots, any difference would have been great. After using this for 2 days, I stopped. My skin felt itchy and my eyes were watery but I didn't even apply it close to my eyes. I was really hoping that this will help lighten the spots and I do understand that all products work for some and not others. Unfortunately, I fell into the others group."
"I've been using this product for 3 weeks now, and I haven't noticed a difference in my skin or dark spots. This actually made me break out more, and it also made my eyes burn. I wouldn't recommend this product . I thought it would make my dark spots disappear , but it didn't and it was a waste of money."
I have been using youth code serum corrector on my face and love it then I decided to use it on my legs because I have very thin skin and dry skin what a difference it made my age spot are slowly fading but the best is my lags are mot dry any more Really wish it would come as a lotion in a bigger bottle
"I love this serum! Along with Miracle Blur and this serum, my face has improved in as little as 2 weeks. I am in love and will continue to use it for years to come. I never thought Loreal was for black skin. I now know better. I've always used Clinique but it is way overpriced. Loreal is just as good but beats Clinique because it's affordable. Thanks Loreal."
"I started using this product on and off since I got it, but just recently started using it every day. I've only used it for a week, but have noticed a difference in my skin. It's a more even tone, looks brighter, and any acne marks are slowly fading. I only use it in the morning, not in the evening. Another thing I like is that even with using the serum, my mosterizer, and my make up primer, my face does not feel oily, heavy or thick. I'm definately going to keep using it!"
This product does a better job than any other brand in it's price range. I'd been using other brands and thought I only needed to maintain the results that I'd recieved. Was I wrong! Youth Code Corrector has surpassed those brands and now my skin is almost spot free.
"I had some slight post acne marks, and hyperpigmentation on my face, after using this product for a few weeks, I've noticed a reduction in discoloration, and a brighter, warmer, more ""glowy"" appearance. My face is more even, and seems to have this luminescent glow to it. Downside is that my face tone does not match my body now, but nevertheless a great product. Wish they made this in a body lotion *hint*."
I have always been a fan of Loreal products..but this one NOT. I remember an article I once read a Dermatologist had written in regards to topical agents you buy DO NOT and WILL NOT so don't waste your money. I guess it's just that people want to believe. I am very disappointed that I spent over $20 plus and used up about the entire bottle now and do not see any differences period. Not even a slight difference! The old saying rises again ... If it sounds too good to be true!!!
"I consider myself to have normal aging skin with normal age spots. Im still in my first week of using this and even the first time we could notice a big difference. My skin looks better, My skin is evening out, It really is more lustrious, and the age spots are already fading a little. Im very anxious to see what happens in the weeks to come. Right now we are very impressed!! Only gave 4 stars cause like i said, its still the 1st week. Best birthday gift i have every gotten. LOL"
"I have tried everything to decrease my dark spots, nothing has really worked. I bought youth code to try it out, and within a week I noticed a changed. Have been using it for about 2 months now and my spots have faded dramaticlly. Even my mom has noticed, money well spent."
"I tried a sample that I found in a magazine and put it on my forehead where I had some annoying fine lines and dry areas as well as acne scars. The next morning,not expecting anything those fine lines were gone, my forehead looked smoother and brighter than it has in a while. The improvement was noticible. I just bought a bottle.. so will update on long -term benefits. But for now, I'm impressed."
"I have tried the serum and SPF 30 Moisturizor for 10 days and each time I apply concealor or liquid make the product starts to peel off, which adds time in getting ready in the morning, because I have to brush off and retouch my makeuo again. Gurrrr I am waiting to see if the product will eliminate my pregnancy mask, which I have had for over 20 years; if it does, I will buy again, if not then no."
"I'm very sorry to speak poorly of this product, because I do love L'Oreal products alot ! Unfortunately the Youth Code line has caused severe bumps in clusters, kinda like a rash. I discontinued using all products and it started to clear up, so I started to use it again to just see if that was truly the culprit over and over again, and again unfortunately it was..:( It made my face look like I was a teenager hitting puberty again ! And i'm 33 years old !! Wasted alot of money sadly.."
A little pricey but i guess you get more bang for your buck and i just started using it two days ago and i instantly saw results! wow factor!
Love how it makes my skin feel.I feel ot works magic .my friends notice a difference in clarity and smoothness. It makes me feel and look younger. Which is a great feeling. It gives me confidence and gets rid of my spots
"Love it! It is the first Dark Spot Corrector that really worked on my skin. After only a few weeks of treatment, almost all of my dark spots are gone or at least their size reduced. Thank you for this amazing product!"
I used it everyday for about 7 months and see no difference at all. I have a dark spot on my cheek that's either from sun or hyperpigmentation due to being on the pill. It didn't fade even the slightest bit.
after using just half a bottle i could already tell the difference with my skin more clear and smooth love it not like other brand oily or thick this feels fresh clean n smooth just love it!!
"I have been using this for almost a month and have not seen any visible difference in my dark spots. I use it in the morning and evening, along with the Youth Code day cream. Disappointed with the product. It does smell good, though."
I have bought this serum a month ago and have been using it since without any results. My skin is not brighter and the sun spots around my eyes and lips are still there. I actually think they are the only thing that got brighter :(
"I will never know if this product actually ever works because (as with most L'Oreal skincare products) I just cannot get past the overpowering smell. I don't mind if a product has some scent to it, but usually it dissipates after use. I could smell this faintly throughout the day and it actually made me nauseous."
Bad packaging!!!! The day i got it it fell n i think it broke something inside no matter how may times i press the serum is not comming out.... Dont know how m i going to use it now... It would have been so good if packaing was done in a proper way :@
"I have very oily skin and usually break out when I use lotions or serums however, I haven't had an issue with Youth Code. Best part is that is has lightened the dark spots on my temples and it costs less than other Department store brands I have tried in the past. I don't normally shop over the counter but, I tried this on a whim and am glad I did."
I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and i can see a very dark spot next to my left eye starting to grow lighter
I have been using this product for the past three months for dark spots and haven't seen any result.
"I bought 2 bottles of the dark spot serum, thinking it would work my dark spots are still the same after 3 to 4 months."
I have been usng this product for a month and there has been no improvement at all. I only had two spots to begin with and there has been no change.
try it several months and see no effect. not recommend to buy .
"Love it!, goes on great, not oily, absorbs quickly, helps with fine lines"
To put it simply - this didn't do a darn thing. No changes in skin spots. Wasted of money.
