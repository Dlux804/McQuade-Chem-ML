This is my holy grail skin product. It moisturizes with no greasy feel. I even use it on my eyes with no issue. I use it morning and night. It never breaks me out or let's me down...I highly recommend!
"I recently tried this moisturizer. I love the results, face is smoother, brighter and looks beautiful. Does not clog pores. Awesome smell. Lightweight, can wear under makeup."
Your product Neutrogena Naturals Multi-Vitamin Nourishing Moisturizer is good for my skin!
"On my second tube. Have sensitivity to a lot of products, but this one seems to be working great."
"I had been searching for a replacement for a lotion I'd been using since the 70's which has been discontinued. This moisturizer is perfect. It's creamy, not greasy or sticky. It absorbs quickly, but leaves my face feeling silky smooth. I love it."
"I purchased this, was looking for something better than i had been using in the past."
"found this, tried it and was so happy with it. Love the cleanser, then the moisturizer and it just soaks in, feel great!"
I bought this a month ago as a men's after shave moisturizer. It doesn't perform as well as other products; i.e. it causes me to sweat under the moisturizer. not good as a men's facial moisturizer ...sorry
"I bought this as I have pretty sensitive acne prone skin. I was wanting to change to a more gentle, natural skincare routine so I thought this would be great. Unfortunately, it usually leaves me with a very red patchy face. It also stings right after I apply it."
"I've been using this for a couple of weeks, I only put it on in the morning but every single time I put it on my skin burns it feels like a really bad sunburn."
So I switched to a different moisturizer and my face stopped burning. I don't recommend this for sensitive or acne prone skin.
"I've given this face lotion a try twice now, hoping it would work. Both times is has severally irritated my face (redness, rash, bumps, etc.) I'm assuming it has something to do with the unnecessary fragrance, which isn't that pleasant to begin with, but who knows."
"Been using for two weeks and so far liking the feeling of the product and have not noticed any major breakouts. It also does not take much of the product to cover my face and neck so I expect the bottle to last a long time. I am not loving the fragrence. It smells super fake fruity in a bad way. Would be a perfect product if it had no fragrence added at all, which would also just be better for our skin."
"I love this moisturizer. It's a great addition to the Naturals line. I have combination/oily, acne-prone skin and this does a great job of moisturizing after I cleanse and put on my Neutrogena acne treatment. My skin feels smooth and comfortable and is able to ""breathe"" still. I wear makeup over it sometimes and it works well for that too. It's not greasy at all and on top of everything else, it smells good. If you have skin like mine, give this a try!"
"I was impressed with the Neutrogena Naturals cleanser and decided to try the moisturizer, it was absolutely not a good idea. The scent of moisturizer is very strong, and after using it for 3 days, it made my skin break out. Would not recommend it at all!!!"
"I love this product ! Please make it for whole body. We moved from a high humidity area to a dry area and my children and I suffered with severe dry skin. Then we found this product, and it was amazing. I love the way it feels and my skin looks incredible. My children also loved it and use it daily."
"I noticed that my skin is changing and breaking out. So, I tried the Neutrogena Naturals facial cleaners and scrub and this moisturizer is just the icing on the cake. I can't belive how smooth and even my skin looks. Even my large pores have disappeared and the dark circles around my eyes have lightened. I love that I now have an easy and economical skin care routine."
I am not certain what product some of the people are reviewing here but the Neutrogena multi-vitamin moisturizer does not have a strong smell. It is a great moisturizer.There is a bit of itchiing/tingling when first applied which is from the vitamin C in the product.
thank you Neutrogena for those of us with sensitive skin who do NOT want SPF . this is the best moisturizer going. i am in my fifties and this has made my skin look younger and smoother. I have gotten compliments on how my skin looks better. i don't want the irritating SPF chemicals. (i can't say that enough !!) for those of you saying it feels too thick and greasy just give it a minute or two and it absorbs nicely. it even helps my makeup go on smoother. i have been buying a few at a time so that i don't run out
"I have been using this moisturizer for about a week now and I love it. I have oily, acne-prone aging skin and this product has not only helped to clear my acne but I have noticed a difference in the wrinkles in my skin. And others have commented on it too. Also, It's great that it is natural and there's practically no smell. Great product. Now Neutrogena needs an eye cream. :)"
"I was shocked when I saw the bad reviews for this product. I seriously love it. I have tried everything from very expensive/high-end brands to drugstore brands for my extremely sensitive skin. Everything would break me out or cause an allergic reaction until I found this. It feels soo nice when applied, has a light yummy scent (kind of smells like oranges but not in an overpowering way), and my skin looks very refreshed/bright. I hope this doesn't get discontinued, I'll buy it as long as Neutrogena keeps making it!"
"I, like so many others, was hoping this product would be good for my sensitive skin. I use pretty much all natural products and was hoping this would be a good product to use. Wrong! This product is a scam and after using it for a few days, I broke out into a rash and it also irritated my already existing breakouts making them worse. Now I just hope that I can get my skin back using ACTUAL natural products."
"I just bought this product because although I have oily skin my skin was not properly hydrated with the moisturizer I was using. Once I used it, my skin began to sing...lol. It gave me this hydrated, refreshing feeling that I haven't had a in long time. Love this moisturizer!!!!"
"I just bought this and the night cream last night, I've been looking for a more natural product to use. So far I really like it but I was super disappointed to realize a ""natural"" product has fragrance in it! Please make a fragrance free version of your products."
"I naturally have very dry skin, and I needed to switch from my other Neutrogena moisturizer with SPF 30 because it irritated my eye area, which has become very dry from cold and the use of acne products. I bought this just today, and I absolutely love it! It leaves my entire face feeling refreshed and radiant. The grease other people are talking about is totally false - if you use just a small amount the size of a quarter, you'll go far. This is definitely a purchase I'm very happy with! It smells good, too."
Just bought this yesterday and was excited to try it. I liked the smell and it was easy to apply. Unfortunately within a few minutes I looked like I had a sunburn and my face felt hot! I started to panic as this had never happened to me. I kept splashing cold water on my face and was debating to hurry to the pharmacy and get some Benadryl. Its Thanksgiving morning! Fortunately it began to fade after about 15 mins. Wish I knew what ingredient caused this reaction.
"I have used Neutrogena Healthy Skin SPF 15 for years, and think it's great. I recently tried this and am crazy about it. All you need is about the size of two peas and my skin feels fantastic, moist and not greasy in the least. I like the other products in the ""Naturals"" line, including the lip balm. I still very much like the Healthy Skin because of the Alpha-Hydroxy and will probably switch back and forth!"
I bought this 4 yrs ago for the first time. Since that this has been best for me. When i cannot find this from market around my home i tried some other moisturizer from other brand. But always this is the best. Nothing could win this. But how come it's even more harder to find this product for me;(? Neutrogena are you try to not produce this product anymore? Please keep selling this. I can never find replacement.
"I'm always reluctant to try different moisturizers as I have oily and acne-prone skin. My skin is also very sensitive, causing me to break out with the slightest change in skin care. I can say that I absolutely love this! It does NOT cause me to develop new acne spots and I love that it doesn't increase the oil feeling on my face. The only downfall would be the scent (not sure how that's ""natural"")"
"This moisturizer doesn't over dry my skin and provides balance to my skin without making it overly oily. It's very rich and creamy in consistency. Depending on how much money I have at the time, it may be costly but it's worth it. I use it every single day. I also use it with the Neutrogena Natural's Acne Spot Treatment. Did I mention it doesn't clog my pores?"
I never write product reviews but I've been searching for the right lotion since another brand discontinued their product a few years ago. I just HAD to share how awesome this is! My skin is prone to acne and other lotions either make my skin dry out or feel too oily but this stuff is amazing! Within two weeks my skin tone has evened out and I break out way less!!! Would definitely recommend this product!
"I have extremely dry, sensitive skin. I am constantly searching for a moisturizer that works. I have been using Neutrogena naturals moisturizer, and I couldn't be happier. I no longer have to remove dry skin patches from my face after showering. This is the PERFECT moisturizer for me!!! I had even resorted to using olive oil on my face -- NOW THAT'S GREASY!!! This product is a keeper!!!!"
"i used to use clinique's cleansing system, but then i left my face wash at a hotel. i didn't want to pay to replace it, so i started using the cleanser + makeup remover from this line with the rest of my clinique products. when my lotion ran out, i thought i'd try this, and i haven't been disappointed! i noticed an improvement in my skin condition after only a few days; and i only need a tiny amount at a time, so i expect it will last a while...unless i leave it at a hotel somewhere..."
"I love this moisturizer. For a long time I only used jojoba oil as a moisturizer, and it left my face oily while not moisturizing the deeper layers of my skin. (jojoba oil does work fine if you use it as a face wash, however. I finally bought this moisturizer and I love it because it smells great, and i have noticed a difference in the softness and texture of my skin. I will be repurchasing."
"I used to love Neurogena's products and when I saw The word ""Naturals"" it sounded even more interesting . I bought the multivitamin nourishing moisturizer and used it on my chest. After one day I had a terrible, painful rash. I put it aside but had second thoughts :maybe the rash was due to something else, (Neutrogena ""naturals"" couldn't do that) used some on my legs, another terrible rash appeared the next day. After 2 sleepless nights : never again Neutrogena! Take this product out of the market!"
"After using another brand name moisturizer, I decided to find something new and natural for my aging skin (55 years old). I have been so happy with this product in so many ways. The puffiness/bags and shadows under my eyes have been greatly reduced. Crows feet and most fine lines have also been lessened and my skin feels fantastic! Please keep this product as is as I am a huge fan! :-)"
"I love Neutrogena products and have never had any problems with any of them, until now. The Neutrogena Naturals multi-vitamin nourishing moisturizer sounded great. It wasn't. I put it on my face, neck, arms, and legs. If it was great, I wanted it slathered all over (my mistake). I broke out in a vicious rash. It had little blisters and wow it itched something awful. It was like having poison ivy. It took about a week to start going away. I still have it. I just feel cheated. I paid to be tortured. I want my money back.!"
"The first week I used this it actually made my face red and blotchy in some areas and it dried it out and had flaking in other areas. I was ready to quit using it but thought I would give it one more week and now I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE it. It has really evened out my skin tone and love how my skin feels. I broke out a little at first also but that has stopped - I do have very acne prone skin. I think the smell is wonderful unlike some of the other reviews. Sure hope they develop this with sunscreen before summer arrives."
"I'm outdoors a lot and and I'm exposed to extremely cold elements in fall/winter and lots of sun in the summer and this product has helped my skin. My skin is more hydrated, looks brighter, feels softer and has softened my fine lines. I never write reviews but this product has exceeded my expectations. Thank you for helping this busy wife, mother and runner look her best. ☺"
"I just bought this lotion since it claims to be mostly all natural and I have somewhat sensitive skin. I used it yesterday and got itchy, red blotches on my face but didn't think it was the lotion since its supposed to be natural. I tried it again today just to see if it is the lotion and the itchy, red blotches are back and worse. Will have to throw it away."
"I'm so glad I found this stuff! IT moisturizes well, absorbs quickly and doesn't feel sticky when I use it at night. I have tried a lot of moisturizers and it's the ONLY one I can bear to use on my face after I use my dermaroller. Everything else I have tried has some sort of alcohol or other irritating ingredient in it, but this one goes on with no stinging. The only thing I wish it had would be ceramics so that the moisturization would last longer in the winter months. It's great for the spring and summer since it does not feel heavy."
"I finally found something for my sensitive acne prone skin that I don't have to worry about my face being burned and waiting for it to heal. I Its gentle, effective and natural . Love, Love, Love, it. I tried high end brands and things from infomercials and nothing worked. Everything has made my skin worse and really greasy. My skin has never looked better."
Thanks Neutrogena
compliments in how my dark circles r gone. I love the product i been trying to find something that is natural and affordable for two yrs. finally i found this product its amazing. But the fragrance has to go out. With pregnancy its hard to moisturize with fragrance for some. i have to stay weeks without a moisturizer cuz of the smell then my eyes would be extremely dry. i dab a little bit when i feel that i wouldnt throw up and works like a charm no more dry eyes.
"I always use a moisturizer under makeup - it makes foundation and blusher look soft and smooth. Neutrogena's Naturals Moisturizer is the very best for this purpose or just to wear alone. I apply it after my shower and it makes my facial skin feel great. The fragrance is lovely - a clean and fresh scent. I also really like the ""weight"" of it -- not too thick, not too thin."
I am 48 years old and have used quite a few products with very dissappointing results. Not this one!!!I have been using the nourishing moisturizer for about a week and a half now and at first there seemed to be a little irritation around my mouth area but I noticed that the rest of my skin felt very hydrated and my pores were not clogged. The irritation has gone and I am completely happy. The skin on my face and neck is smoother and looks more refreshed than it has in a long time.
"I love this. Second bottle just purchased. I have oily skin with surface dehydration & large pores all over and it's pretty sensitive & easily clogs/pimples. This is so hydrating & leaves my skin so soft with a perfectly natural finish & does not feel or look greasy or shiny. Has an invigorating feel after it's applied, I get a little flush sometimes but it's short lived & in my opinion normal considering the actions & benefits of the star ingredients. It's perfect for me, i love it, & can't beat the price!"
"I just recently bought this moisturizer to replace my Aveeno one. It looked like it would be a good moisturizer so I tried it. I didn't have s bad reaction at first but it has a very greasy feel. I actually do like the scent but I have been noticing the more I use it, the more irritated my skin has been. I have been breaking out very badly and after putting it on my cheeks have been getting super red and stinging. Not sure what it is with this product but I plan on taking it back."
I love all of the naturals products. They feel great on my skin. Do not make me feel dried out our oily.
"Unfortunately had the same bad reaction as some other reviewers...red, itchy, stinging skin after 1 use."
So disappointed!
"I just bought this lotion and I had an allergic reaction to it. I used it twice to make sure that it was the lotion and it caused red, hot,"
"itchy, blotches on my face. I'm not sure what ingredient could be causing this."
This product made my skin breakout with big red acne and when it heal it left scars. This has never happened to me before with any product or in my teen years.
"Well this product does do what it says, it moisturizes with natural ingredients- but the smell is so strong! It's overwhelming, at least for me. If they just toned down the smell I think it would make the product so much better."
"While this product does moisturize the skin very nicely, it'd be better if advertised as a winter moisturizer. It's way too heavy for spring/summer/fall."
"I love this moisturizer! I have been looking for a product that didn't contain sunscreen or retinol, and this one fit the bill. I love the scent of it and how soft my skin feels. Please don't discontinue this!"
"I've been searching for a good face cream that's natural without all the added toxins and is not overly expensive. I've finally found it! It smells great. As soon as I put it on, my face feels soft all day. Thank you for a great product!"
"I bought this two weeks ago and it has made such an amazing difference in my skin! It used to be super dry and I struggled finding a moisturizer that hydrated lightly, ensuring my skin didn't feel oily afterwards. This product is a lifesaver!!"
I've been using this face cream for about 3 months now and I love this cream as it smells wonderful and is great to use under make-up and before bed. It actually does increase the moisture and moisture retention of my skin and gives it a soft glow.
The product does make my skin soft but the scent is overpowering. To me it smells like a public bathroom air freshener. I will be returning it. Please make this product without scent! If it becomes fragrance free then I will try it again.
"The smell isn't over powering at all. My skin tends to be acne-prone & sensitive, but this doesn't cause me to break out! It blends in well & doesn't make my face look greasy."
"I absolutely love this product! It is a great moisturizer and makes my skin feel fresh and clean. However, I wish that they make one with SPF! that would really make this product a top seller... especially in the summer :)"
This product really works as it says! I like that my skin inmediately feels nourished and healthy. And my skin doesn´t feel or look grassy. The price is OK.
I don't get why there is bad reviews. All you have to use is a little bit and it spreads and lasts a long time! I will definitely buy this product again. It actually helps clear up my acne too! I love it!
"My skin looks and feels amazing! It also has a nice clean fresh scent, not too strong or overwhelming. I'm also using the pore scrub as well. I really love neutrogena products!"
Beware if you have sensitive skin! I bought this after a recommendation by the Neutrogena phone rep.to replace a discontinued moisturizer. It aggravated my rosacea and left a burning sensation.
This product has improved my facial skin appearance. Through continuous use it has made my skin softer. In conjunction with the Naturals cleanser it easily finds dirty pores and gets rid of them. IT is faster and more improved than other products
"As a teen, i suffer from acne scaring. This product has really helped those scars fade away and makes my skin look amazing. I would definitely recommend this product. :)"
"A little goes a long way! I really like the smell, it is similar to the night cream. Using both products I have much softer skin. My only complaint is how thick it feels at first, but I soon realized it was because I was using too much!"
I absolutely love the natural line products! They are better than any I've used before! Im extremely health conscious and am so excited about these products! Just wish there was a tad more product in each bottle!
This product smells great and work great too! I was my face with the Neutrogena Naturals face wash. Before I would use regular lotion and switched to this. My face now feels and looks softer. Iv'e also noticed less breakouts.
I have been using this product now for two months and I absolutely love it. It doesn't clog my pores. It leaves my skin well hydrated but never oily. This is a permanent part of my daily skin care.
I love the smell of this moisturizer and it makes my skin feel great. I use it every day before I put my makeup on. i highly recommend this product. Have been using it for a few years and am pleased with the results!
"Incredible cream. This lotion is by far the best I've ever experienced. I have very dry skin and this cream is very moisturizing without feeling oily, my skin feels silky and radiant and I'm a black women. The night cream is also a must."
I have had horrible acne my entire life and have tried everything. This moisturizer has helped clear my acne tremendously. It might not have the same effect on everyone but it sure has helped me. I love it!
"Excellent Skin Care Products! My skin feels soft and refreshed. Thanks Neutrogena for wonderful basic skin care products and the yummy scent! I am truly happy with all your ""Naturals"" products."
"Hyrdrates my dry,sensitive skin,absorbs completly,didnt break me out or make me oily. I use this day and night duringt he winter and at night during summer If it had spf in it i would use it during the day in the summer as well its just fantastic."
I have super dry skin on my face (even worse in the Winter months) but i can apply this in one application and my dry skin is gone! This is my go to for anyone that ask for recommendations on facial moisturizers.
"This moisturizer feels more like a hand lotion than a facial moisturizer. It seems to takes a while to absorb into the skin. It also has a strong scent, so if you don't like strong scented lotion all over your face, you should probably keep looking."
"This moisturizer leaves my skin so hydrated, it gives my skin the natural glowy, healthy, dewy skin. I get so many compliments! I love that it's natural and I know exactly what im putting on my face. I use this all the time and don't plan from switching brands."
"Kind of expensive per oz, but you only need a little. Absorbs well."
"twice i have applied NN multi-vitamin night cream and it made my skin tingle in an irritating way. I see this has happened to others. Why is there no response from the company?? I use other Neutrogena products regularly, particularly the moisturizer for sensitive skin."
"I used this moisturizer for a few weeks at both morning and night. I really wanted to like this moisturizer because it is derived from natural ingredients. Unfortunately, it left a really heavy residue on my face that left it feeling clogged. My skin is very sensitive and it did not react to this in an allergic way, but I feel that it did contribute to a few breakouts!"
I was so excited to try this new line and thought it would be perfect. A few days after using the product I developed rashes on my cheeks along with bumps. It was clearly an allergic reaction which I have never had on anything before in my life. My neck was blotchy and my face was bumpy. It was embarrassing and went away after a few days when i stopped using the moisturizer.
Have not used the product but a few weeks... I like the wat it feels when you apply to your face.... have also used it on my hands and it feels soft and smooth..... I am most interested in the fact that it is full of vitamins and antioxidents...... ..
"I recently bought Neutrogena Naturals Multi-Vitamin Nourishing Moisturizer for my 13 year old daughter. Within minutes of applying, her cheekbones and eyelids became swollen and were burning & itching. Very disappointed that a ""natural"" product would cause such a reaction!"
"I use this product almost every day and I love it! Sometimes it does burn my skin when it is irritated but that is because my skin is pretty sensitive. It sinks in fairly quickly and at first it does feel a little heavy, but once it sinks in my skin feels soft and healthy. The smell is nothing special - it smells natural haha"
"So I began using this product on a Saturday, used it every day fro about four days. I loved the amount of moister it gave me, and i really enjoyed the fragrance. On the Wednesday after my first use i noticed some very quickly to appear acne spots, EVERYWHERE. My skin rarely breaks out but is very sensitive so i thought this product would be perfect. On Thursday i had the worst HUGE spots and horribly flaky skin. Today, after a day with out use my skin is very dried out to the point of bleeding. Not impressed."
"I used this moisturizer ONCE and within a few hours, my cheeks were warm and itchy. After 4 hours, I had a full on rash on my cheeks and lower jaw. I cross referenced the ingredients in this moisturizer with Burts Bees Facial Cleansing Towelettes (since my last allergic reaction was to that product) and there are a few similar components. This is very disappointing since I prefer to use naturally based cosmetics. It has been 3 days now since I first applied this product and still have the rash on my face; it is less swollen, but still there."
"After reading mixed reviews for this product, I decided to try it. Since moisturizers with SPF tend to dry out my skin, I was looking for one without SPF. Have been using this product for 6 weeks and absolutely love my skin. It looks smooth, healthy, and has cleared up the irritated dry areas. I have tried many different moisturizers and this one is the best for my skin. The product has a smell, but to me it is pleasant and not offensive. Not sure what the ""natural"" ingredients are, but they work for me. Great product!"
"I bought this product a few months ago, and so far i've been loving it. I use it as my daily moisturizer and it leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth after using my cleanser. I have eczema and combination skin so I'm glad that it didn't leave my skin feeling irritated and oily. My only wish is that it would have sunscreen protection. Other than that this moisturizer is a great buy. ."
"Compared to similar products by other brands this one is expensive, but my skin is acne prone and after washing my face with 10% benzoil peroxide, this product keeps my skin from drying out. I would wholeheartedly recommend this moisturizer, but I could do without the fragrance."
"Purchased it a few days ago and I love it. I hate moisturizers with fragrance, this one is light and feels great on the skin"
This is the best face moisturizer ever. I use it after the pore clearfing scrub. My nose usually peels easily but with this it doesn't. Love it!
Bought this thinking it truly was natural. OMG the SMELL is SICKENING. Must return as it gives me a headache when I unscrew the lid.
"I just bought this yesterday, used last night and this morning and my face and neck are broke out. Red and blotchy...."
I am not very satisfied with this nuetrogena product. It made my skin a little itchy and doesn't really moisturize a lot for me. It smells good though.
"I had high hopes when I purchased this product; however, I was sadly disappointed. It smells funny and is rather sticky. It doesn't seem to do a very good job of moisturizing. On the plus side, it doesn't clog my pores."
I have been using this product for 7 days now and I have rashes all over my face and neck. I have an oil skin type and I'm dark skinned. is there hope that this rashes will disappear?
"Smells amazing, don't need very much for large surface area, and it soaks in immediately to a smooth, almost powdered, satin finish! Doesn't look oily and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft! Love!"
"I have searched for a moisturizer for a long time before finding this amazing product! I absolutely love it! It leaves my skin so soft, doesn't clog pores, and over I can tell a major difference in the softness of my skin. Love it so much!"
"I have sensitive and combination skin and this moisturizer has been GREAT. I love that the naturals line shows where the ingredients come from. This is definitely my favorite moisturizer, and I hope they never discontinue it!"
"I see a lot of good reviews of this product, but unfortunately I had a bad reaction and broke out in hives soon after it was applied to my hands."
"Reading some other reviews, it looks like some folks have had the same experience."
"Can not use this product. I had itchy red skin after one application. It smells great and absorbs quickly into the skin, which I loved. But then the allergic reaction happened and I am hugely disappointed."
This is a perfect moisturizer for any day and everyday. I highly recommend it. You can feel your skin getting healthier as you continue usage. The vitamins really make you skin glow (in a good way). Totally gonna buy more when I run out again.
Combined with the purifying pore cleaners it is a Win Win situation for. I have tried many different more expensive acne skin care products is am seeing better results with this selection.
Couldn't use. Was empty
I give this 3 stars because while using it my face never felt so soft and for the most part looked so healthy (I have very dull sensitive skin). However it made my face sooo greasy. If I wiped my finger across my forehead it was gross and eventually led me to break out more than normal. What a shame.
"I've tried every moisturizer even other neutrogenas products, and not one of them moisturized this amazing. My skin is soft and smooth after just 2 uses along with the naturals scrub (also awesome). It doesnt leave your face greasy looking, it looks matte for a moisturizer! Just get it you won't be disappointed!"
"This is the only moisturizer I've found that really improves the feel of my skin and doesn't lead to oiliness or breakouts. I see some reviews here saying that this moisturizer actually led to the user having skin flare ups - maybe different skin types just react differently? Regardless, love this stuff! Please keep it going."
"I really wanted to like this because of the natural aspect. However, I found that the moisturizer has caused me to break out near my mouth. I find that it is quite oily but it doesn't help to moisturize my skin. My t-zone becomes oily from the moisturizer while my cheeks are always dry and chapped. I liked the smell but I have switched to a better brand of moisturizer and will not repurchase his one."
"A couple days after using I could feel a roughness to my face and realized that my face looked red and rashy, like windburn but with bumps. I stopped using and my face slowly returned to normal after rash opened and dry skin flaked off. There must be some ingredient in this that I'm allergic to but I've never had that type of reaction to any other face lotion. Sounds like too many people reacting to this."
"I bought bareminerals lotion for the last few years. I had to try something cheaper, so I tried this and it works great for really dry skin. My face never gets oily and I've been using this all winter. It has a pleasant not too strong smell, and my face has not broke out whatsoever which I've always had problems with rashes and dry patches of skin. Not sure how it will be in the summer tho. If your face gets oily even the slightest I dont know how good or not this would be for you."
I bought this a month ago and I was extremely unhappy with it. My face is very sensitive and I figured since this was natural it would be ok to use. Immediately after use my face turned bright red and blotchy and made me break out all over whike still leaving my skin dry.
"I love this product! My skin was so damaged from harsh chemicals to get rid of my acne. My skin was dull, lifeless, and looked 10+ years older than I actually am. I used a thicker amount at night, and in the morning I wash my face and then put a thinner layer on. It is a little heavy so if your skin is drier more would have to be put on than if your skin is oily."
"I've been using the Naturals Multi-Vitamin Nourishing Moisturizer at night for about 3 weeks. My face feels hydrated & soft when I wake up, with a nice scent when I apply it. My skin is super sensitive but I've had no problems with this moisturizer. Thanks Neutrogena!"
"for a couple yrs now ive used proactive, but when I needed to switch to a cheaper moisturizer I picked this up & decided to give it a try. I have dry skin and I was surprised to find out it doesn't clog my pores, it didn't make me break out, it didn't sting, it didn't cause redness, it kept me moisturized all day, thanx Neutrogena!"
"I tried this and didnt like the results. My face felt tight and everything seemed redder. But then I tried it on my legs, and oh wow. I was surprised. They were much smoother and didnt leave a greasy feeling. This product is too expense to use as a body lotion but doesnt work with the sensitive skin on my face."
"I usually use the Intensive Daily Moisture for my face during the winter months, but since that product has been discontinued, I tried this instead. I wish I hadn't. My skin is breaking out all over and by mid-day my face feels tight and dry. The fragrance isn't the best either. I will be switching to another brand."
I started using this product because my breakouts were getting out of control. I would wash my face and it would get super dry. I needed a moisturizer that wouldn't clog my pores. I have been using this product for I dont know how many months and it's awesome for my sensitive. It doesn't smell and it's light weight and absurbs quickly.
"This stuff is great, normally moisturizers undo all the work my cleansers have just finished, but no this one. It's very light and it does the job with a very small amount of product. My skin is hydrated with half the amount of moisturizer of other brands. LOVE IT!"
I only use a small amount and it's enough to moisturize my whole face.
"It smells good. It feels good. And I wake up with soft, supple skin."
My holy grail moisturizer began to burn my face so I bought this and instantly fell in love.
It's okay. It makes my skin soft for a short period of time.
Great product you just need a little bit to go along way. My skin is so soft. I have never used anything that was so good before.
I have been using the product for almost two weeks. My skin looks great and feels soft. My only complaint is the overpowering scent.
I like that this moisturizer doesn't contain sunscreen. I use it every morning and it keeps dry spots at bay all day.
"When I put it on my face it is soooo amazing and hydrating, I cant!! This stuff is pure magic and it helps so much for dry skin types! :)"
I love the product firstly it is more natural and so light. I like the smell very much since it gives me a fresh and clean feel.
I bought this product for my husband a month or so ago. He is always looking for moisturizers. He lives using this. It helps keep his skin moisturized
"I used this for less than a week and now have a horrible itchy, red rash all over my face. I'm now on day 3 of not using it and I have to use a steroid cream to just control the itching."
Stay far away. What a waste of money.
"After 4 days of using this product, my skin is red, puffy, and extremely itchy. I have a sensitivity to SPF and was excited to find a Neutrogena product without SPF. Too bad it makes me break out worse than if it did. I'm very disappointed."
Nicely sooths my face after cleansing with just the right amount of moisture. Perfect for under makeup or at nighttime. I use retinol products and use this without getting any irritation on my sensitive skin. I love it !
"I used a small amount of this on my son's face and neck (I realize he is not the right age group for this, but it was handy and I thought being natural might be ok for a one-time use# and he had an allergic reaction witihin minutes #red streaks). I am not sure which ingredient caused this."
This stuff makes my normal/combination skin so oily after an hour or so no matter how small of a dot I use. It makes my skin so oily I'm shocked it hasn't caused breakouts. I'm trying my hardest to use the rest by only applying it at night but even that might not continue. I like all natural products but this one is not for me.
"I have been using this product for 2 months now and I can tell this is the best moisturizer I have used so far. This instants moisturizes and softens the skin like a dream! After applying it the skin feels very soft. It also brings some radiance to the skin, which is good since it claims that it reduces dullness. It does not break me out or cause irritation like other moisturizers have in the past. Love, love, LOVE this product and I recommend this to people and will be repurchasing!"
"Ever get a lip balm so moisturizing that your eye litterally roll back into your head??? When I applied this moisterizer the first time, that���s what happened. I may have even moan a little (not ashamed either). IT FEELS THAT GOOD ON MY SKIN!!! I'm allergic to a lot of products, I have eczema, and my skin is slightly dry in my T-zone, I have had NO problems with this or any of the Naturals line! Thanks Neutrogena!!"
I just found this yesterday! I have used Neutrogena Healthy Skin for years but the sunscreen was turning all my clothes orange. Tried the oil free and was very disappointed and very dry. Tried the night cream....nope. Tried this today after the wash cloth test to see if it turned it orange (passed the test) . At least today it seems good and I like the smell. No reactions and the texture of my skin feels better after even just one use!!!
"My skin has never been sensitive to anything. After using the moisturizer for about 2 months, i noticed my lips started to burn around the area where i put moisturizer. It leaves my lips chapped, burning, and even cracked. It's very uncomfortable, and leaves me feeling embarrassed to walk in public with my lips looking like this. I didn't put the moisturizer directly on my lips, but some how it ends up making them feel horrible."
"Hi Neutrogena,"
I tried the multi vitamin daily moisturizer yesterday. I had a bad rashes on my face just after 15mins applying it. I had itchiness on my face all over. It's really a bad experience to me. I washed my face and it reduced the itchiness. i can send you my pictures as well. Really disappointed with this moisturizer.Will never buy again.
"This is the first moisturizing cream that doesn't break me out! I have tried a whole lot of them but being a brown skin African, this product works great for my face. It doesn't clog my pores and I loved it! I use it once a day, every morning on my face and neck and it lasts through the entire day. I have a sensitive skin but this product does it well! I'm about to order another box because I can't afford to run out!"
"I have been struggling to find a moisturizer that doesn't break my oily acne prone skin out. I use a ckeanser, benzoyl peroxide cream and then this after the BP cream dries. I do this in the am and pm. It really has helped reduce my cystic acne flare ups dramatically. I would recommend this moisturizer to anyone and I break out very easily. It has reduced the oil that my skin normally produces if I hadnt uses a moisturizer. I am 37 years old and female."
Doesn't smell the best and feels weird when you first put it on. Once you rub it in though you can't smell it and it feels normal. I started getting lazy and my acne started getting bad again so I started washing it again everyday and using all these products which cleared my face up but left my chin and lower half of my cheeks dry and flakey. Got this moisturizer and two days later my face was no longer dry and back to smooth.
"My skin usually does well with any kind of product, but this stuff made my entire face break out and get extremely itchy. I used it for a couple days and then had to completely stop, as it just got worse. Not sure what ingredient would have been the culprit. I hadn't changed my diet or any other products I was using, so I'm thinking this was the cause! I've never had a reaction to a facial product like this!"
I really love this moisturizer. It provides the perfect amount of hydration for when my skin is oily and it is also amazing for when my skin is dry. It smells great and makes your skin feel amazing! Highly recommend this as well as the cleanser to go with it. :)
"I really like high end face care products and try to stick to products that are all natural but when in a pinch this stuff is great! It's lightweight, smells great, and my combination/oily skin loves this product. My dermatologist always suggested neutrogena products as well and that lead me to this purchase."
"I have searched for many products to use for my very sensitive skin. This one has surpassed them all - this includes very expensive brands! My skin is glowing, does not feel heavy, and this product is not too strong smelling, I find it very pleasant - I have migraines. I hope many will use this product and it will stay around and not be taken off the market. I love the night cream and make-up cleansing remover as well. All are perfect for my fair sensitive/dry skin. Thank you for offering a skin care line that works for me now!"
"I was excited to use this product, but it made my skin itchy with red blotches on the first day. The next day I tried it again, but put on a little less and it did the same. Not sure why! It made my skin have a burn sensation. One thing I have noticed with the Neutrogena line is that they don't have any safety protection seals on there products, which I would of liked to see!"
Very moisturizing. Great for dry skin. Wouldn't recommend for oily or combination skin.
"After applying this moisturizer, I felt a very very strong stinging in my skin. I immediately washed it off and it left my skin red and irritated."
Applied Neutrogena Naturals in the morning after a
shower and several hours later my forehead & cheeks
"puffy, red, itchy."
"I have very senstive skin that, turns red , but this is great . I am 59 ,and I tried very expensive creams. Please don't stop making this"
"This lotion has really helped with my dry skin. At first I bought this for my face, but I have discovered that it works really well for the dry skin on my legs. I wish I could find it in bigger tubes."
"I usually love neutrogena products but this was a huge disappointment. I washed it off my face immediately after applying it because it felt thick, greasy, and smelled very unpleasant. I tried to give it to my daughter but she too immediately washed it off for the same reasons. I was unable to give this to any of my 3 kids, a friend, or even my husband."
"I have sensitive dry skin and acne. I thought this would help, but I can't stand the smell of my own face when I wear it. The back of the box claims that ""fragrance"" is ""essential to blend the product together and maintain effectiveness."" #1 This cannot possibly be true. #2 Moisturizer that smells awful is not effective. I am disgusted that a product striving for earth friendliness would add fragrance under the claim that it was essential to the effectiveness of the moisturizer."
So far I have used the Neutrogena Naturals cleanser/makeup remover and the Neutrogena Naturals Nightime Facial Moisturizer and they are both wonderful products. I would love to try the daytime moisturizer but it does not contain any SPF. Everyone knows sun protection is key when it comes to fighting signs of aging.
"Within an hour after setting my makeup with powder the moisturizer shows through with the oils which causes my face to become shiny. By the end of the day, my make up would not stay put. I've worn this moisturizer without makeup before and let me tell you it reverses everything the label promises. The product feels heavy and my pores feel clogged which may contribute to my frequent breakouts. This product is best for SUPER dry skin. If you have normal skin--STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!!!"
"I bought this cream because I cannot find my favorite one anymore. I thought that was the replacement for the Intensified Daily moisturizer. I don't like it, the skin does not feel moist. Now I would have to look for another daily cream from another brand."
"I have been using Neutrogena products for probably over 10 years including healthy skin face lotions and neutrogena sun screen as it has always kept my dry skin moisturized. Came across this new product and liked the idea that it had more natural ingredients in it. I often don't get an allergic reaction to any product I have tried but I definitely did to this one. I do have pictures of what the cream did to my face, but not able to upload them on here to show you what it did."
"I've been using this product for about a year. I love the fact that it has vitamins and anti-oxidants. It only requires a little of the product to cover your entire face. Does not leave an oily shine. Some reviewers have stated that they developed irritation. I am an esthetician and I know that some people are sensitive to different types of vitamin C. I feel a slight tingling sometimes when I apply the moisturizer, but nothing serious and no lasting negative effects."
The skin on my face has never felt better. I too have a tendency to get flaky skin with Moisturizers that contain an spf so please don't change this formula!! I use this in the morning before I apply make up and at night to sleep in. It is non-greasy and has a pleasant smell. I love neutrogena products!!
"I was nervous that this would smell funny, as sometimes more natural products have an odd odor, but this moisturizer smells quite nice! Earthy yet pleasant. It is a very thick cream, but it doesn't clog my pores or make me break out at all! A little bit goes a long way, and my skin always feels hydrated and even after using this product."
"I used Clinique moisturizer for many years, thinking it had to be good because I paid a lot for it. Yet, I often had problems with dry scaly skin on my face. A year ago, I decided to try Neutrogena Naturals. It's affordable and wonderful. My dry skin has disappeared. I use both day and night creams. Love the light scent and it doesn't take much for each use. I hope this product stays around for a long time."
"Since using this product my skin around my nose and above my lip became very dry and started to peel. I then started using my usual neutrogena face lotion, but based on where I am staying I have to resort to using this one from time to time. When I do use it, the rest of my skin feels great. Other than my skin drying out, I liked it."
I love this product. The smell is AMAZING!....it goes on smooth and not oily....
Great for my winter eczema
I noticed my skin looks a lot better!! I use every day.
This is the greatest! It makes my skin soft and less dry .
My skin looks perfect since I started use the moisturizer!
"soooooo light, it's perfect for a morning face moisturizer. and it smells wonderful!!!!!!"
For my acne this did ok. it definelty wasnt a miricle worker but i guess it did its job? I have acne and it did ok with trying to get rid of it.
"I have used it and my skin immediately felt very dried and became red, it was horrible , I have tried many moisturizers in my life but I never had this experince before"
"This is the first winter since I have started using this moisturizer. It is the first time I have not had dry, peeling skin on my face, which happens every winter. It doesnt leave my skin greasy, it is perfect!"
"Lotion has a nice smell and absorbs without feeling greasy. However, within a minute after applying it to my face I had an itching burning sensation to my cheeks. Skin dryed and broke out in that area after use."
"After I wash my face with Neutrogena Naturals face cleansers, I use this product to finish. I usually have to apply twice because my face still feels dry after the first use."
"this lotion is ok but for me it's not smooth at all and is actually a little sticky, no SPF, so I bought it to use at night as a lite moisturizer, will not buy again, smells ok though"
It smells like chocolate. Loved the texture.
When I used this product my skin started to become red and started to swell up. I really just want to know why this happened.
The second I put it on my face it caused stining and itching. This does nothing to moisturize my skin.
"Just smells strange, like vitamins. I can't stand the smell, which is strange for Neutrogena, since I always love how subtle their scents are."
Perfect for me.
Love this
I love it on my face
After a week I started breaking out. I look like a teenager.I bought it because is all natural.
Good moisturizer... if only it had spf 15 or 30 it would be perfect for daytime use!
DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY DOES NOT WORK...MY SKIN WAS DRY & TIGHT AFTER USING THE PRODUCT.....
It burns my skin and my pimples started blooming again. I am not happy.
"I like the toner of this brand, but I wonder why the cream is so bad!"
