"I love love this sunscreen. I have very oily skin, when I use this sunscreen I don't look shiny. I don't know why I didn't know about this company before? Its just so amazing! It smells great and it goes on smoothly."
This is a nice sunscreen moisturizer to use on a daily basis. I also use the anti-aging serum from Image underneath. The light scent is pleasant and doesn't overwhelm and it has worked for me in the Florida sun.
It does a good job. Generally keeps my face clear.
"Is a nice moisturizer not too light no too thick, with UV protection. No need for anything else."
The best moisturizer I have ever used! Better price than at the estheticians!
I have used this product for years
"I ordered this cream at the end of May 2019. The cream arrived in time at the beginning of June, but unfortunately the expiry date was till august 2019. I was extremely disappointed about this, because I ordered 2 creams, one for me, and the other one for my friend. Neither me, nor my friend will manage to finish them till expiry date((("
