I use this a few times a week when it's late and I need to take my makeup off but don't want to go through the full nightly routine. I wet the cloth a bit and it gently takes off even mascara. Then I rinse the cloth well and go over my face and eyes just to make sure there is no cleaner residue left. I also use the Aveeno cloths when I have on more makeup but the Olay cloths are a bit more gentle but just as effective.
"The ""negative"" thing about it is that once you open the bag, you cannot close it back. I had to put them all in a large zip-lock bag."
"I bought some nice smelling face cleansing cloths before, and they smelled really nice and was okay for awhile. Then one day they stung my face. I wondered why all of a sudden they would really hurt my face, so I researched it and found that most of them contain alcohol. This can dry out the skin and sometimes cause stinging or a burning feeling on your face. In my case it was very painful. this product cleans my face well, and doesn't hurt my face, so I love it! It also leaves my face soft."
I enjoy using these face wipes they are not heavy and are light on my face and it makes my face feel cleaner they are not used for just removing makeup
The only ones I use. Any others are rough and some don't take the make-up off well enough. We don't need all these smells in all the products we buy. Olay beats them all.
I have been using Olay products for over 25 years and I love the products After using Olay face cleaner follow with age defying moisturizer.
Work pretty well. Sturdy and strong. No irritation!! Have not used with makeup but cleans oily dirty skin!
Great for makeup removal or for when I'm just too tired to really wash my face!
"Olay is an excellent product, this is the perfect convenience item."
I found this product didn't remove my makeup as good as some other brands I've used. I will not buy again.
I use these sensitive skin cleansing cloths for everything! Mostly I use them for taking off makeup before I deep cleanse my skin with foaming cleanser. I like that they remove all my eye makeup without irritating my eyes. I also use them on my grandson to wipe down his face or just to refresh my skin on a hot day outside. These are my daily 'go to' product for easy cleaning and portability. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love my Olay Gentle Clean wet cleansing cloths. I have used these cleasing cloths for years and will not use any other product. They are the perfect way to gently but deeply clean my ""mature"" skin prior to the application of my Olay Micro-Sculpting moisturizer. Could not get along without my Olay facial regimen! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Since I was a little girl I have been seen my family using Oil of Olay products. And because I have a sensitive skin specially in the eye area I have to use special products. When I'd tried Olay wet facial cleansing cloths sensitive my worries disappeared. Never has allergic reactions in my face.
"Wow!!! Where do I start? Theses Olay cleansing wipes are such a gem. Perfect for when I don't have the time to use facial wash. Certainly after a workout, I can grab my Cleansing Towelettes, and just like that, my face is totally refreshed!!!! Love Olay for allowing me to be my #BestBeautiful❤️ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used, and been disappointed with other towelettes. I find Olay cleansing towelettes to be 100% more satisfying - they have a moisturizing feel without being overly wet. Other towelettes have a dry, totally unsatisfying feel, not so, Olay towelettes. Olay towelettes remove my makeup and cleanse thoroughly. I will never substitute Olay towelettes for another brand, never!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Wet Cleansing Towelettes babies your skin while it wipes away all of the makeup and harsh elements that your face is exposed to. Plus it is so easy to take with you when you travel. You know you will get a fresh and gentle clean up!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
These wet wipes not only remove ALL my makeup but they leave my skin silky smooth with no greasy after effect. One wipe each night take off the toughest eye makeup including mascara [which I adore but hate removing]. It's great on my sensitive skin even around the eyes. I have no burning or stinging sensation like with other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use these at night to help clean my makeup off before I put my night cream on. I never realized how dirty my face is. My face feels clean and smooth. No wash rags or soap needed, however I still have olay soap for when I run out unexpectedly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use these on the go I have super oily skin and these really help me to fresh up and keep my skin free of oil and they just give me an overall fresh feeling. My wife has been taking these out of my bag and using them as well [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I wash my face as soon as I get home from work. Depending on what I do after dinner I use these towelettes on my face before I go to bed to remove any trace of sweat, oil, etc. They are gentle on my sensitive skin so I don't have to worry about them drying out my skin or irritation.

I use these daily and they remove makeup and clean leaving my face feeling fresh! They are very handy when camping also. I have started my teenage grandchildren on them and they have cleared up their acne! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"These wipes didn't work for me! I had to press and scrub my face with the wipe to just get a little of my makeup off and then it still didn't get all the dirt and make up off of my face!! Not satisfied at all, very disappointed and not worth the money I paid."
Daily Facials Express - Sensitive Skin is the best facial cleanser product for on the go people! This is great to have when you go camping or traveling or even at home. It does not irritate your skin and it leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed while it removes all make-up.
These are hard to find in Honduras so everytime I can I order them in large quantities. They remove my makeup easily and my face feels so fresh like if I had washed it! A 5 star definitely!! Love them and they always come with me wherever I go!
"I have used Olay products for many many years and am very happy. However, these cleansing wipes did not remove my makeup and the package would not completely reseal. I had to tape it down."
I have used this product for a while. It is definetly the best product I have ever used. Not to mention that this is my absolute favorite brand of all time! I hope you enjoy using this product as much as I did!!

"This product is amazing. I use it to remove makeup and it does not irritate my skin. I have very sensitive,dry skin and most products dry out my skin and break me out but this didn't . I'm completely in love. I think I've gone through 9 packages"
"I have tried other cleansing wipes, marketed for sensitive skin, and these are the only ones that do not make my face sting or turn red. Thanks for making a great product!"
I love the facial cloths because they are so convenient and portable. I carry them with me on the road and to the gym. They even come in handy when I need a little refreshing during a long day. Thanks olay.
I love this product! My skin is super sensitive and the face cloths have never irritated my skin. It is the best thing I have found to remove my makeup and just daily dirt that isn't harsh on my face. I don't think I will ever stop using these.
These have no scent and just the right amount of moisture. I bought them on a whim because I ran out of my other makeup cleansing cloths. #contest
I've used this cleansing wipe for years now and I love it. Works just as it should and leaves nothing behind but clean skin.
I use this product twice a day before bed and when I wake up. Great for removing makeup and revitalizing your face!
My sensitive skin usually has a reaction to other facial cleansers but not with this product. Simply amazing.
It works great for me and my girlfriend. I'd recommend it to my friends and family. Thank you for the products. Your company is awesome
