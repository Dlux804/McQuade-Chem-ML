"I have always used oil of olay products and never had problems with my skin, face or body. They are a quality product without the price tag."
"At 54 and 3/4 years of age ... The sensitive facial wash is all I can use! I get awful breakouts if I do not! It is WORTH it's weight in gold! :) I would get the generic if I could, but otherwise, I use Oil of Olay exclusively! :)"
Good facial cleanser for sensitive skin. I'm a big fan of Olay product. Fast shipping by Walmart. Thanks!
First time I have tried this product. I am very pleased with it
"I have been having issues with break-outs, acne, which is just not normal for a 69 year old. So, decided to find a facial cleanser that would rule out the product I was using as the culprit. It worked"
It really cleans my face and makes it feel so soft.
So far so good. Haven't been using long enough to give five stars. Time will tell.
"I ordered two containers. The face wash is terrific - it both cleanses and smooths the skin and is good for even the most sensitive skin. My only problem was with the packaging. Once of the ""squirt"" attachments had been taped down so tightly for packaging that it doesn't work."
I wasnt expecting much because of the price but it works just as well if not better than other similar facial cleansers. Im glad i decided to try it this is my new cleanser :)
"I have been using this product for many, many years. I never have to worry about breaking out from it or if I have a little sunburn it won't sting my skin or irritate it. I love the pump, it is more convenient in the shower than having to flip a lid and water doesn't collect in the lid if left on the shower shelf like I've had happen with their cleanser in a tube bottle. It easily removes my waterproof mascara and does not sting the eyes. It is so affordable and works so well, it's the only face cleanser I will use."
"I have very oily, sensative and tends to breakout skin and was trying new products. I ordered this based on the positive reviews but the product didn't work for me. It left my skin feeling very dry and did not help with breakouts. However, this product does have a very nice scent that I enjoyed. It is also very creamy and easy to apply. It is one of those products that a little bit goes a long way."
"Does not completely remove makeup but for those with sensitive skin who wear little to no makeup, would be perfect! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Does not dry out my face
"This product claims its for sensitive skin. My skin isnât TOO sensitive but it does react to some products by reddening my face for a short amount of time. I used this product for 2 days in a row and for both days my face would be bright red and hot all throughout the day. I finally realized it was the cleanser and i stopped using it, now my face is fine. I do not recommend this if you do have sensitive skin"
"I think this product is okay. It doesn't do anything spectacular for my skin but it does the job. It's quite gentle and gets the dirt off of my skin, but it's a foaming cleanser so not ideal for sensitive skin. It's a good value for its price though, and if you're looking for a budget sensitive facial cleanser, then this one is for you!"
"I absolutely love the way that my face feels after I use this product! And it smells awesome, and is fairly inexpensive. Which is great for the value! Olay never disappoints me, and I use this companies brand as my go to products. 5 stars everytime!!"
Great item especially for traveling. The consistency is nice and gives a nice lather. Fresh scent and your face feel great when rinsed. Reasonably priced for an Olay product. I love to use the Olay Whips Moisturizer along with the combo keeps my face flowing without makeup.
I was happy with this item
"Have been using this for years, great for sensitive skin."
I have very sensitive skin and this product works great for me.
It leaves your face super clean but make sure to wet your fase first it's not a foam
"Works good, make skin soft and smooth. Satisfied with this product."
I have extremely sensitive skin and this product gently cleans without irritation. I don't know what I'd use if this wasn't an option.
"As it says, gentle cleaning. I have sensitive skin and this product doesn't irritate my skin at all."
Perfect for those with skin issues. I have very sensitive skin.allergies to all perfu.ed products. Pump works perfectly and never leaks.
"I've been using this for a week now and so far I like it. I do use a moisturizer afterwards. No burning, itching or drying out after use."
...I JUST WISH IT HAD A PLEASANT SCENT. THIS 'SENSITIVE SKIN' PRODUCT WAS THE ONLY FOAMING SOAP AVAILABLE. BUT IT DOES THE JOB NICELY.
"Doesn't dry out our skin, but gets it clean. No weird smells. Just does what it is supposed to do. Nothing more. Nothing less."
Nice lather and not drying at all. Use every day. I have combination skin but my cheeks can get very dry and sensitive and this never irritates my skin.
have been using for yrs. can also be used as body was in a rush Winner Winner Gentle and no fragrance!!!!
This makes my skin feel pretty good but I don't see any real difference in the appearance of my skin.
This product was great for me with having sensitive skin. It was gental and I love the smell of it. It also didn't leave a harsh mask feel to your face afterwards.
Overall a good cleanser. It dissolves most makeup on second wash. The cleanser is slightly stripping so I wouldn't recommend for dry skin. I have combo skin and it works well. It doesn't sting my eyes which is always a must have benefit.
I really enjoy using this gentle clean foaming face cleanser for sensitive skin its great for all skin types and I have oily skin. Its really gentle which is amazing and I would definitely recommend it to everyone else.
I have very sensitive skin and found this to be non-allergy producing. I would use it daily but I'm more into wipes these days due to the convenience and not as messy. It definitely does the trick for the price.
"It cleans your face. It's nothing special. The foam makes dry skin feel dry if you don't moisturize quickly after. For the price, I'd rather pay a few extra bucks and get Cetaphil or Cera Ve, but that's just me. This does do the job, but I wouldn't recommend to people that wear a lot of makeup daily and then need a good daily cleanser."
"Olay is one of the few products that I can use on my skin. It is gentle, soothing, packed full of moisture that my skin needs, and somehow tough on dirt. I have a few conditions that make finding products that touch my skin difficult, but Olay wins every time. Olay makes products that actually help my skin, not products that are only tolerable."
"This is a superb product for some many reasons but catch this, my partner has a tiny bit of eczema and her skin drys out quickly, opposite to that I have oily skin that can be a pest, we both have our own sensitivities but this cleanser works sooo well for both of us. It doesnt overly dry her out and so she doesnt have to over lotion. And for me, it gets the dirt off my face after a long day without taking away the essential oils we need to stay moisturized!"
"Did wonders to my skin, which is often very dry and sensitive. My skin didn't react, and made my skin much softer and hydrated. It's a very soft product, and was absolutely worth the money, and was too pricey either. I would definitely buy it again and recommend to others."
very nice and smooth feel good on face makes my face feel very soft and clean . i would say it's very gentle to say the least repeat user of course olay is very nice and a clean product . id say the packaging is nice and of course i tend to buy when i have money!
I have sensitive skin and it��s always hard to find the right product that helps. I like this product cause it is gentle on my face. I use it in the morning and the evening. I love how clean my face gets and how it makes my skin feel after using. I recommend
I have pretty sensitive skin and it's been pretty difficult to find a cleanser that isn't too harsh on my face. But this product outweighed all of the others I have tried. Mega pleased with it and I am a forever customer of this product. My mind and face are happy!
I really do love olay the brand can be a little heavy handed on all the chemicals but I dont get any type of allergic reaction. The smell is so perfect it's feminine but it doesn't smell over perfumed . The quality in ny opinion is worth the price on certain items they can be expensive especially for drugstore name but the face scrubs and moisturizers have been excellent
I have been using this cleanser for about 6 or 7 years and I would recommend it to just about anyone. It is mild and has little to no scent to it. It cleans my face well without over drying. It seems to help with the smoothness of my face. It is safe to use daily without drying you out
"Really loved this product! Very gentle on my skin but gets the job done. I love how it makes my skin feel after I use it, and it's such a nice product to use when my skin is really bad. Would highly recommend this product and would definitely get it again!"
Very light yet effective. I felt that the cleanser was exactly what I was looking for. I was definitely excited to find something that worked as it stated. The price point was on point and just what I was looking for. I will definitely be buying again.
I purchased this because it was foaming and I'd never tried a foaming cleanser before. I was really disappointed. There was hardly any foam and my face did not feel clean after I finished washing. I tried it for a week straight to see if I felt differently but I did not. I would not recommend this to anyone.
"I love how this cleanser feels on my face. In the past I have used cleansers that felt rough on my face, I have very sensitive skin. But, this cleanser makes me feel fresh. I love how Olay packaged their products, using clear instructions on how to use the product. Try this product out for yourself and enjoy!"
"Foams up nice! Normally, I dont feel like foaming cleansers cleanse as well as a scrub. This one changed my mind! I felt clean and my skin didnt feel dry or irritated afterwards. The price is fair for the product you receive. I'd definitely recommend."
"This is one of my go-to facial washes I incorporate in my daily routine. It's gentle on the skin while leaving my face extra clean. Easy to handle container. It's very affective and won't dry out my skin, nor will it leave my face with blotches like other products."
This is a good product for very sensitive skin such as myself . Unfortunately with Rosacea my skin will become red if you touch it with certain products and will become irritated. This product does not make it irritated at all. Just a little bit goes a long way. And it gets all the makeup and dirt out of your pores so you're looking fresh!
This always makes my face feel so fresh and clean. Never any residue or sticky feeling. It doesn't irritate your skin or dry it out. I'm very pleased with the results I get from all olay products and this one isn't any different. It did not disappoint.
"Actually really like this cleanser. I have a big problem with facial cleansers: If I don't use them, my face gets all clogged up, if I do, my face gets super dry. This was a very good solution. It doesn't smell strong and leaves my face feeling moisturized."
My face is prone to break- outs. Olay face wash helps get that deep clean. Helps to reduce pores and breakouts. My grandma Used Olay and loved it. since I've started using this face wash I've noticed a huge difference in my skin. Givethis product an A+
"This cleanser is definitely gentle on sensitive skin, which is great. My main issue is that the foaming cleansers just don't seem to clean as well as other cleansers I have used in the past. If you have really delicate skin this may be the best bet for you."
I didn't get what I ordered but it works just like the one I ordered. So love it.
Excellent for dry skin. soothing and non drying.
very gentle and great cleanser
does the job [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Facial wash, can't use regular soap [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Never had an issue with any Olay facial cleanswer - use all different varieties and like them all
I have used this for years and love the product. It isn't oily and makes your skin feel smooth.
"I have been using this since it first came out, I have sensitive skin and finding a great product is difficult. This one leaves my skin feeling clean, hydrated. and no lasting filmy feeling on it. It never makes my face feel dry or itchy, I then follow with the Regenergist Lotion and serum. I think Olay is the first company to have products that actually make a difference in our skin and have different formulations for different phases of our life. I have been a loyal fan since 1975....thank you Olay!!!"
Great product
"This is a great product, but recently they reduced the size of the tube from 7oz to 5oz & kept the price the same. Isn't this a little greedy? I have lost respect for the company because of this. Guess money is more important than good customer relations."
It is so gentle on my sensitive skin! So glad I tried it! Please don't discontinue making it.
Makes skin feel clean and refreshed. Not over drying. Smells clean. Also is affordable and not overpriced.
Love love love this! And it smells amazing! Makes my skin feel extremely soft and clean after using it.
Olay is a great product and it works I use it all over my face it give me a good feeling of fresh it keep my skin clean and smooth
I use Olay before I go to bed. I wash my face and then use Olay wipes. I really like the clean feeling of my facewash. It's well worth the price.
This product is very good and gentle on my skin. I have hard water where I live and This product keeps my skin with the right type of moisture.
"I love this product, it is not only fun that it foams up a bit but I feel like it is really gentle and works great! It smells clean and can be used for my sensitive skin! I would recommend this product!"
It is a very mild cleanser but has lots of chemical in it but nice packaging but it could act as harsh product in skin it cleanses the face in a good way but not the effective
This is very gentle on your skin. I have sensitive skin and most products tend to make my face turn all red and hot. This one does not do that at all. Pretty packaging. It's affordable
Olay Regenerist Whip Facial Moisturizer his product did a excellent job for my skin type. Will be recommending it to my friends with similar skin concerns and issues.
This product was very gentle on my skin however if it had more of a fragrance or all over texture to it I may have felt like I was actually cleansing my shin.
I use to use this every-day and it made my face feel so great and look great. I have slacked on doing my daily face washes and haven't used it in like 6 months.
I love a foam face wash. Olay products always work well with my sensitive skin. There's never a feeling of dryness or film after use. Their sensitive skin products are perfect for my fair dry easily triggered skin.
This Foaming face wash is great. Awesome for the combination skin types. Leaves your skin feeling clean smooth and refreshed . Great Value great price
I have very sensitive skin so I decided to try this. It did not get any oil or make up off my face. It felt like a greasy film was like behind and nothing came off. I would not buy this again.
I love olay all of their products are super gentle on my skin and doesnt dry it out! Every single product I've used of olays I haven't been disappointed
I use this as a acne fighter for my sensitive skin on my back. It does not dry out my skin and leaves it very smooth after the first application. I would recommend this product to anyone with oily skin.
"This cleanser is amazing!! It's very sensitive so it doesn't make me break out, or leave my skin oily! My husband and I both love it. Works exactly like the packaging says."
"Okay gentle clean foaming face cleanser for sensitive skin is a lovely product. I use it two or three times every day. Is is very gentle on my sensitive skin. It isn't very foamy, which I like. I feel fresh and clean afterwards!"
I have been using this product for awhile now and I am impressed. I look forward to washing my face now. I like the foamy suds. It totally does the trick
I love this face wash! It never irritates my super sensitive skin! And it foam's up really well! And it is totally affordable! I will be buying this again!
I love using this stuff.. when I go to the store I lawyer pick one up so I never run out because of how it makes my face feel so clean and fresh.. and I don't think I would change to anything else for my face.
This face wash works just perfect for me. I have a very dry and senstive skin. This product is very gentle and creamy. My skin feels really soft and leaves a little moisture afterwards.
Very sudsy. Leaves my face very refreshed. I have been using it for years. My great grandma used Olay all her life and never had wrinkles so I am trying to follow in her footsteps!
Amazing product! It is so hard for me to find facial products that don't irritate my skin! I love the upside down bottle that allows the usage of the entire bottle of face wash!
I use this every night before going to bed. I use it after my workouts. And it has cleared my face so much. It doesn't feel dry afterwards like most face cleaners I have used in the past. Definitely recommend this product
I love this cleanser for on the morning. It is so gentle on my skin and doesn't strip it all which I love. It also was not expensive which is another plus. I would buy this again in the future.
"The cleaner felt gentle. It smelled great too. My skin is very sensitive so I was s but apprehensive. However, my skin felt clean and soft without any rash or itching."
leave my face so clean my skin loves this my skin is super sensitive and with this it's fine nice packaging cheap price super effective the only little thing the smell it doesn't smell bad but it could smell better
I absolutely love this product. Leaves my face feeling clean but not dry. I would recommend this product for people with oily skin. My skin felt soft.
Great cleanser! Works wonders for my sensitive skin. Overall love it and love the price of it! Good packaging and it last for a long time. I would definitely buy it again and recommend it to others who have sensitive skin issues like me
My teenage daughter used this and seems to like it ALOT. It is a good product. She says it makes her skin soft and helps with her breakouts. It is priced well for how well it works for her. We will continue to use it.
"First you take away the foaming cleanser that so many, including myself, liked, then we try the the Gentle Clean, which is not quite as good, and now you reduce the package size? Looking elsewhere. i recommend it for sure but it could be better"
NIce and gentle. I've been using for years. No problems so far.
"Have been using for years, my favorite face cleaners"
"My skin is extremely sensitive and this product cleans my skin without over drying. It is gentle and causes no irritation. I would recommend it to anyone with dry, sensitive skin."
It works good.
"IVE BEEN LOOKING FOR A PRODUCT THAT WOULD BE GENTLE ON MY FACE AND NOT DRY IT OUT AND MAKE IT FEEL SUPER AFTER WASHING AND WOW WHAT A GREAT SURPRISE.. MY ROOM MATE TRIED IT AND THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST EVER TOO... MEN, WASH YOUR FACE WITH THIS THEN SHAVE...WHAT A DIFFERENCE.BEST PRODUCT IN TOWN....."
"I've used Clinique products since I was a teenager. I'm no longer a teenager and I've noticed in the last few years that my skin is not quite as ""glowy"" as it once was. I'd run out of my usual 18.00 a tube foaming cleanser, and, on a whim, I tried this product. I will NEVER spend 18.00 on that cleanser again! For less than 1/2 the price, my skin is SO clean, soft, and glowy again. This is an amazing cleanser and would be worth it at twice the price."
"ive been using olay products for years ,keeps skin soft and moisturised."
This is a great product for those of us who have overly sensitive skin and at a great price!!
I love the feel of it and how it easily glides on my skin.
Very good and doesnt make my face break out and also makes my face fell very refresh
I have sensitive skin and this cleanser was perfect for me. It washes nicely with no residue after rinsing. My skin felt refreshed!
"I love this product. It really helped clean my face. It was a great value, I just wish the price had been better."
"I love it because it foams up nicely and is gentle on my skin. The fragrance is subtle. I usually have coupons, so it's not expensive."
My father uses this for his face and is very happy with the product. It doesn't inflame his face the way that ordinary soap does.
I'm not really in to the foaming kinda clean that this product puts out. I was given a sample to try but I probably wouldn't buy it to use.
This product is wonderful! I use it in the mornings and at night. It has become one of my MUST HAVES! I Recommend it to everyone that I know.
This product was great! I like the foaming action and it feel good on the skin. I have used this product a few times.
It works great not to expensive I always feel so relaxed and fresh to start or finish my day and makes my skin look good
Great products. Easy on skin. Cleaned makeup wonderfully without being too rough and also not leaving skin greasy.
"Love how fresh this leaves my face after use. Affordable, and easy to use. I love how it doesn't irritate my skin."
I absolutely love this product super sensitive to my skin. I have acne probe skin and this does the job. Strong enough to get all that makeup off.
This cleanser works great you feel fresh and clean after every wash its affordable And gets the job done
Very good to clean your face and very soft when you use... I love this product.. try this this product for sensitive skin
"This is a good cleanser. It's nice and gentle. It didn't bother my skin at all. I liked the foaming action, it made me feel clean and fresh."
Calming cleanser for any day of the week. I looked like I came from the tropical rainforest after using this.
This face cleanser is really really gentle. It may be a gentle formula but it really does get all the books and crannies on your face lol
This product was awesome! Loved the way it made my face feel. It was even 4 my sensitive skin. I use it everynight.
Foaming cleaner for your face is a light and very amazing smelling cleansing product for your face. Getting deep in your pores but gently.
I use this every time I take a shower! It's great for removing all the dirt and keeping the face nice and clean
This is my main facial cleanser. When I can afford it. It's always leaves my face feeling great and clean.
I love you the fuzzy feeling it gives when you put it on and it smells great. Even though he doesn't admit it
This is just like any other face wash. Yes it is gentle to skin and will not make your face dry. But it's not that I'll specially buy again.
Great product for the price. Nice and affordable and I will definitely repurchase. My skin felt lovely and soft after use
The play gentle clean foaming face cleanser for sensitive skin is nothing more than a simple cleaner. Not harsh at all. Would recommend
The product didn't break out my super sensitive skin but it didn't clean it very well. Overall a bit disappointing.
This cleanser is amazing ! I high recommend it to anyone with not oily and not to dry skin ! It's fresh and feels amazing!
This foaling cleanser is gentle yet removes dirt even for sensitive combo skin types like myself it has no harsh fragrances or smells
"One of my favorite face cleansers! Makes my skin feel soft and rejuvenated, has a nice odor and makes my skin soft."
I wasn't crazy about this product. I have oily skin and it dried my face out. My skin felt too clean almost.
I enjoy foaming facial cleansers and Okay is one of my favorite moisturizing/cleansing brands. I love this product.
Amazing quality products face treatment of products quality highly recommend wounderful products affordable quality products
This cleanser was great. The formula was very moisturizing and lightweight. Perfect for a everyday cleanser.
An amazing gentle cleanser that is tough enough to remove my makeup without stripping my skins moisture barrier.
This was definitely the most addictive thing I've ever had. I love it!! You can have that porcelain skin
I like how foamy this product gets. It lathers really well and my skin always clears up when I use this. I also like the way it smells. Very clean.
It's ok. Not my favorite and can be a bit pricey for store brand. Left my face soft but I feel like theres better products out there to try
Very gentle on my skin and has a very neutral smell. Much lighter than other things from Olay. Would consider this a daily cleanser.
This product makesmy Skin really soft and clean makes my face feel tight. I would definitely buy it again when I break out
"Gentle, removes day-to-day dirt, however, does not remove makeup adequately. Usually use this after removing makeup thoroughly."
Great product Love the texture .. Helps in visibly fairer complexion and doesn't make skin dry. Lovely smell
Love anything that foams as it is❤️my skin is very sensitive and this didn't break me out or make me red so that's a thumbs up for me❤️
Olay Gentle Clean Foaming Face Cleanser. Nice and very gentle cleaning foam. It makes my face soft.its food for sensitive skin
"This product left my skin feeling amazing, fresh, and clean in a matter of minutes! The price is perfect, and its easy to find locally!"
Perfect for sensitive combination skin because it doesn't dry skin out and cleans deep down in pores.
This product worked good on my sensitive skin I did not have a reaction at all to this. Smells good!
My skin is very sensitive so I gave this product a try and if worked really great. It was better than I thought it would be
It worked well for how it was supposed to work but for me I like something that will make my skin matte.
I love this product!! It cleans my face effectively and leaves my face feeling soft and moisturized. The price is awesome to.
This product was okay but for the brand I would expect better it didn't really improve or damage my skin.
Great product for face cleaning! No terrible smell. Gentle on my skin. Leaves my face feeling clean.
"Got the job done, but the wipe didn't go a long way. Usually takes me about 3 and thats for minimum makeup."
"A small amount goes a long way, so from a price perspective it's a great buy. It foams up nicely, and washes off with no residue."
Love it! My skin can be kind of sensitive and this was truly gentle. But also strong enough to clean my face well.
Just started using this and I'm very pleased. It isn't overly drying and is very gentle. A little goes a long way with this product!
"I have been buying this product for years. It works well on my face, it does not dry it and it is not greasy. I would recommend it to anyone that has sensitive skin."
"Olay, please don't ever stop making this stuff. I have tried many different sensitive-skin face washes and this is the only one that is truly fragrance-free. Even so-called ""natural"" or ""sensitve"" brands irritate my skin. I read in a magazine that this product was voted best face wash for sensitve-skin and I would have to agree."
This product is absolutely terrible!!!! PLEASE DON'T BUY IT!!! it completely ruined my skin to the point where I have pimples and dry/broken skin all over my face. This occurred only a couple of says after trying the product. I wish I never would've bought it.
"I have been using this formula for more years than I can remember, and I'm 40 now. I always get asked what I used on my face because it's truly flawless, smooth, and looks quite young, and I attribute that to this particular face wash because my skin is incredibly sensitive, and it only got more so after cancer treatments. I recommend it to everyone, and all my teen daughters use it/swear by it as well. Gentle is the way to go! I have tried other brands, but they always irritated my skin."
"For those with sensitive skin that need that gentle cleansing this is a great product! Great value for the cost and the packaging, a little goes a long way! Very gentle with my sensitive skin and no reactions at all. Definitely recommend this product!"
"This is my favorite morning face wash. It is gentle on my sensitive skin. I've been using this for awhile, and really like it. It's the best of the ""sensitive skin"" moderately-priced cleansers I've found, cleans well without drying, and lasts quite a long time. Initially, I used it either with my hands or a soft washcloth, but recently I've been using it with a Philips skin cleaner with good results. You don't need to use much at all for it to do its job. Olay Gentle Clean Foaming Face Cleanser For Sensitive Skin"
"Over the years, I have developed sensitive skin, this product is amazing because it's a great cleanser & doesn't irritate my skin. The packaging is nice.. basic.. but it's what's INSIDE the packaging that I care about. And it truly is a great product!"
I have used this product since I was 20 years old and I will be 60 this year and it not only cleans my face but I don't have any wrinkles yet. After using this product I use the moisturizing lotion by Olay and you don't have to spend alot of money to look nice.
"Very gentle on my sensitive normal to dry skin but cleans thoroughly. I have been using this for 10 or more years. It is great in hot, humid weather and doesn't' strip your skin in cooler months. It cleans completely but doesn't leave your face dry and tight."
"I have been using this cleanser since 2013 when it had a different name, size, and formula. Five years later, I still SWEAR by this cleanser despite all of the changes. It cleanses effectively yet doesn't strip the skin or break me out, and it doesn't irritate my skin. Please never discontinue this!!!!!"
"I'm a teenager who has had forehead and cheek acne for years now, and I wish back then I had found this product. It is by far the best product for people who break out to a lot of chemicals and want something simple.I highly, highly suggest this product and am so thankful I came across it."
"I have been using this face wash for what seems to be 10 years! I have super sensitive skin. I wash my face twice a day with it. I wear full makeup all day. If I travel and forget this product, I go buy it, because 1 or 2 nights of using anything else I breakout. In the summer, humid months it is the only product I use. In the winter, dry months I need to apply moisturizer (will only use Olay products for sensitive skin). It is my favorite product in my daily routine!"
"I have been using Olay Foaming Face Wash Normal for many years. In the repackaging/reformulation of the new products, you have dropped the Normal cleanser. I tried the Gentle Clean cleanser. It has a very thick consistency and is difficult to rinse off in soft water conditions. It looks and smells like glue. I find it difficult to understand why you decided to no longer offer a product for normal skin conditions (only oily and sensitive) . I am now left to look for a better product elsewhere."
I love the foaming action it you can really tell that it's getting in your pores and cleaning your face. I told my mother to use this product and she really loves it too she said she can really tell that there's a big difference from her other face cleaners. I highly suggest that anybody who wants a truly radiant face by this product.
"Started using this about a year ago, after trials of different face washes that only dried out my sensitive skin, causing more breakouts. This trusty stuff, in combination with my facial spin brush, gives me a great face cleaning, without over-drying. Its nealry scentless and foams up perfectly, plus its easy to rinse off. Im especially glad it is not the consistency of lotion, like so many other sensitive skin washes Ive tried. Plus its affordable!"
"I am not a fan of the new formula AT ALL. I LOVED the old formula and the ladies in my family had used this cleaner for years and years as first recommended by of our dermatologist (oil free, soap free foaming cleanser for sensitive skin), and it was the best face wash. Please bring back the old face wash!!"
Recently I have been getting very oily skin. I've used a couple other products and finally found this one. It definitely does the job for me. I'm all about beauty and skincare. I highly recommend this product to my friends. They always come to me for advice. As well as customers at the drugstore that sells this particular product.
"I finally broke down and bought the new gentle clean cleanser. IT SUCKS. The original had the highest rating on Beautypedia, highly recommended by beauty editors and cosmetics cop, removed all make-up, mascara and liquid eyeliner, AND left my skin clean. This new formula is hard to wash off, leaves my skin dirty. I will not recommend this new face wash. It doesn't work. Bring back the original formula, I (and obviously many others) will be a very grateful and happy customer."
"I am DEVASTATED with the new formula. This used to remove all my makeup and have such a silky, foamy lather, gently cleaning my skin entirely. The new formula feels like hand soap, doesn't remove ANY of my makeup and makes my skin look terrible. Seriously, so so sad."
"The original version of this was the only facewash that suited my acne prone super sensitive skin for the past decade :( Now that I have started using the newer formula, I am seeing acne reappear :( PLEASE BRING THE ORIGINAL FORMULA BACK. MY SKIN NEEDS IT"
"So sad they changed the formula alongside the redesigned packaging. Why change something that was perfect?! This used to be the only cleanser that worked on my super sensitive, acne-prone, and oily skin. It removed make up well, and didn't dry my skin out or make me break out. Please bring the old formula back!"
"The list of ingredients on the website is for the old formula, not the new. I have both bottles in front of me so I am not guessing. Disodium Lauroamphodiacetate and Laureate-10 are in the old product but not in the new. Aloe Barbadensis Leaf juice, listed as the 5th ingredient of 18 in the old product is now Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Extract, listed as the last ingredient of 16 in the new product. I will be returning the item."
"Formula has been modfied, concurrent with name change. I've used Olay Foaming Face Wash for many years and would never have considered switching until now. New formula generates less lather and skin does not feel as clean. So disappointed. I think I'm going to drive to stores around town to see if I can locate some of the former product, tiding me over while I attempt to find a new face wash that I'm happy with."
I am so disappointed in this product. I used the old formula product for years and years and it was the best face wash in the market for my skin. I am so disappointed in this version and you have definitely lost a loyal Olay customer. Why change something that was raved about for so long? I'd rather pay a higher price for the original version with more Aloe content.
I have used Olay foaming face wash for probably over 15 years. I like to use water to clean my face and this face wash not only takes off my make up but also my mascara. It makes my skin feel really clean. It's the only one I use. The only thing I'm disappointed in is that it recently changed to a tube-type dispenser instead of the pump dispenser. The pump was much more convenient. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I USE THE OLAY GENTLE CLEAN FOAMING CLEANSER FOR MY SENSITIVE SKIN. I HAVE A CLEANING BURSH AND THIS PRODUCT HAS MAINTAINED MY CLEAN FACIAL SKIN, NO NEW BREAK OUTS, I GROW HAIR ON MY FACE IT ALSO ASSIST WITH NO INGROWN HAIRS, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT THE THE YOUNG LADIE MY AGE 65 AND ABOVE. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cleanser really leaves my face looking and feeling clean. I love that it really is gentle but again it actually cleans my face. I felt and saw a difference within three days of using it morning and night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use to use another brand, but they stopped making it. So since I use regentrist which makes my face feel so refreshed and look younger, I decided to try the gentle skin foam. I am amazed at well and gentle this product is. No more red spots on my face since it is much more gentle. This does not have an odor either! I am so glad that I decided to try it. I want to try the anti-aging 7 effects moistierizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cleanser makes my skin feel firm and clean. I use it every day to cleanse my face and prepare it before using my Olay lotion. My skin feels fresh and clean after I use this Olay gentle clean cleanser for sensitive skin. I love my Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is an excellent cleanser that removes makeup, oil and sunscreen. One simple step removes everything and leaves my face soft, smooth and clean. My skin often reacts unfavorably to drugstore products because they often have too much added fragrance or something like menthol. Not this! It is mildly scented, if at all, and does not contain any irritating ingredients. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used many cleansers and by far this is the best for me. It is great for sensitive skin and my face feels so soft afterwards. Does not have that tight feeling. This will be the only cleanser I will use from now on. Love this stuff. Also this cleanser is not expensive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love using this cleanser for two reasons: 1) as stated in my title, it's not drying like so many cleansers and 2) it removes my makeup without having to use a second product. I have extremely sensitive skin and find that Olay products work well for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my absolute favorite for my sensitive skin! I have eczema and it causes itchy, dry areas. My face in particular is an area I pay special attention to. I love Olay Gentle Foaming Cleanser because it never irritates in fact it helps soothe any problem areas. I can always count on Olay for my skin! Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love the foaming cleanser. Keeps my face and skin feeling refreshed and clean without over drying. I've always been a fan of Olay and this cleanser has just won me over! Way to go Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Why was this product changed around???? I used the Olay sensitive foaming wash for years and it was the only product that ever worked for my skin. This ""gentle clean"" product doesn't give the same results. Please bring back the sensitive foaming wash!!!!!!"
"I could understand getting a new package but there was no reason to reformulate this face wash. It was perfectly fine. Used it for years. Please switch it back to how it was. Also, your list of ingredients on this page is wrong. The aloe is now at the bottom of the list!"
"I don't like the new gentle cleanser. I am returning it and will now try the oil minimizing one. I hope the next one is better! I have been using the older foaming face wash for years, I understand changing the packaging, but why the product? Disappointed"
"I've struggled with break outs, extreme combination skin, and redness for as long as I can remember. I bought this cleanser and the lotion and my skin hasn't been the same since. Since switching I've found my break outs to be purely hormonal and minimal at that. My skin is much more even in terms of tone and texture and I have noticed the redness I used to experience and stress over is not that noticeable now!"
I've been using CeraVe Hydrating Cleanser which is very gentle. But I was always having to wash a second and sometimes third time as it never completely cleaned off my makeupl. I took a chance on Olay Gentle Clean and was shocked to see that my toner wasn't picking up any makeup residue at all! LOVE that this product is fragrance-free and bonus points for foaming even though it's soap-free. PLEASE don't discontinue this PERFECT cleanser!!!
"Olay advertises that the list of ingredients are the same. They are not! Olay has cut down on the Aloe in the new product. This changes the product completely. If you put the bottles side by side, it's clear to see the difference. In the Foaming Face Wash the Aloe is listed as the sixth ingredient and in the new Gentle Clean is listed as the last ingredient. This makes a HUGE difference in the product. Olay hasn't made these changes when advertising the new cleanser."
"I have tried many other face washes, and none can clean my skin as well as this one. It gently removes any make up or lotion, leaving my skin clean, and soft. The foaming helps a little bit go a long way. This is definitely a product I ""can't live without""."
"I've struggled for years to find one cleanser for my dry, sensitive, acne prone skin. This product leaves my skin ultra fresh and moisturized and removes all traces of makeup without over drying or breaking me out. Other cleansers are over drying or actually burn my skin. This is a life saver! I'll never buy any other! Thank you, Olay!"
"I have been using Olay's Foaming Face Wash for Sensitive Skin for some time now and I love the way it treats my skin!! It feels soft and smooth after I wash it and best of all, it doesn't feel or look dry. I don't even have to use a facial moisturizer afterwards unless I want to. I will continue to use this product and please don't discontinue it Olay!! Thank you!!"
"I love the olay face wash, it makes my skin feel smooth and as a user of all olay products I love them.The face wash is excellent and I will advise all ladies who is 65 or older to use the olay face wash because continuous use will help make the skin look younger and feel soft. I told someone my age and they could not believe I am 65.I WOULD RECOMMEND this face cleaner for all those who wants beautiful, younger skin."
"Please never discontinue this product! It is seriously a hidden gem in the world of skincare! This cleanser effectively removes dirt, oil, and makeup for a low price and one tube lasts forever! It also has never irritated my skin. I usually rotate my skin care products to try new things, but I will never swap out this cleanser! It has been a stable fixture in my skincare routine and will always be. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this foaming face wash with my facial brush. It's gentle on my skin and cleans it very well without stripping it of all the oils, leaving it feeling too tight. I also like that it comes in a handy pump format. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used Oil of Olay foaming face wash for sensitive skin for nearly a decade and I still have the same love affair with the results. It deep cleanses without over drying my skin and leaves it soft, and radiant. I've tried other more expensive cleansers, fad cleansers, etc...but always seemed to go back to the amazing results of my Oil of Olay, and became a loyal consumer 10 years ago. #LoyalForLifeToOlay [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this in the morning because it cleans well without stripping my face dry. I also use it at night with my Olay facial brush 2x a week to thoroughly remove my makeup at night. It has a pleasant scent and I love using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the way this product leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. Being for sensitive skin is its best feature. I like knowing when I use it, won't have to worry about my skin reacting. I use this product almost daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Foaming Face Wash, for Sensitive Skin is one of the best cleanser values you can buy at the drugstore. It is ideal for sensitive skin and is an excellent cleanser that truly removes makeup without leaving your skin feeling dry or tight. I have tried other more expensive products that did not work anywhere near as well as this. As far as I'm concerned this is the best facial cleanser ever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this face wash for several years now, and I have been very pleased with it. I have scent allergies, and this face wash is perfect - it is fragrance-free, so it doesn't cause a reaction or itchiness when I use it. It also clean the skin, leaving it feeling fresh without drying it out. I would highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"All of your face washes are wonderful, but my favorite is the foaming face wash for sensitive skin. As of late, my aging skin has rejected the stronger, more fragrant moisturizers and treatments. My skin has responded favorably to the products made for sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been on a skin care regime for over 30 years, I have been usin oil of Olay products for the past ten years. Out of all the products have used in the past oil of Olay classics is the best. The foaming Face Wash leaves my skin clean, clear and fresh. It is very important to have good face wash to ensure your skin's pores are clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using The Foaming Face Wash for Sensitive Skin for many years now. I used other brands and products from pre teen and on, and as soon as I tried this product, I have never looked back.

"After having children my skin changed, I couldn't figure out why I kept havin horrible breakouts! The stronger the product I used the worse my achne got. My skin had never been so sensitive. Foaming face wash for sensitive skin saved my face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this foaming cleanser for over 20 years. I have strayed, but I have always returned. This is my favorite go to cleanser EVER. It leaves your skin clean, soft, oil free, yet perfectly balanced. It is amazing and never disappoints, unlike so many others. I have also passed on this addiction to at least 5 others, so try it, you just might be very pleasantly surprised! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cleaning product is perfect for those with sensitive skin. By using a very small amount of product and a bit of warm water I was able to cover and cleanse my face and neck. The cleanser had a pleasant scent and was smooth and creamy. My face felt clean without the stinging or tingling. My skin didn't feel tight.but rather smooth and moisturized.

Since I could remember Olay products have been in my family for years. My mom uses their products. And I do as well. I am 44 years old and I have no wrinkles. I have tried other products and I hated them. I will always stay with Olay. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Allthough I am way past the age for breakouts, still every so often, one pops up at the most inopportune time like a wedding or a special gala. Since I have been using OLAY FOAMING FACEWASH -- not one embarrassing zit!! Yay for Olay!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have this in my shower and I use it almost everyday. There are times when I use Olay exfoliating cleanser when I feel I need a little more deep cleaning. The sensitive face wash doesn't dry my face like ordinary bar soap and I have noticeably smoother and softer skin. Thank you Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"As I wash my face at night, the foaming cleanser covers my face in a soft, gentle manner while removing make-up, oil, dirt, etc. As I rinse with warm water, then cool, my face feels totally clean and refreshed, ready for my nighttime Oil of Olay moisturizer!! My Mom loved it and so do I. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am an active outdoors woman, so I subject my skin to a lot of sun exposure. The Olay face cleanser does a great job of removing the sun block, and grit from the bike rides without harming or drying out my face. And having a sensitive skin situation, I have to be careful what I use. The foaming face wash is the perfect answer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This is a facial cleanser I ""ve bee n using it for a long time, it cleans, softens & doesn""t irritate my sensitive skin. Very mild & fragrance free which I like, not like others with a strong scent which would cause an irritation. This is the only facial wash I use ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cleanser is too good to be true. Even the longest-wearing make-up doesn't stand a chance. And as if that weren't wonderful enough, it doesn't dry my skin, or sting my eyes! I honestly couldn't ask for a more perfect product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Economically priced, the foaming face wash delivers even more value since a very small amount is all that is needed to wash your face and neck. There are no overpowering scents, just a nice clean smell. After washing, skin feels very smooth and clean, but not dry or tight. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried to use other cleansers over the years and my face always breaks out. I never have that problem with the Foaming Face Wash. I panic when my store doesn't have any in stock. I have learned to buy a back up. I always follow up with the regenerist sculpting cream. My face always feel silky clean and very soft. Don't ever stop making them.

I have very sensitive skin with rosacea and this foaming face wash feels so nice on my skin. It does not dry out my face. My skin does not feel tight but soft and smooth.

I have been using this product for several years and people ask me if I'm in my 30's, and I am in my 50's. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cleanser is the best I have ever used. It clears skin without over drying and is perfect for sensitive skin that is dry with problems. I love that it is fragrance free and love the fact that it comes in the tube. Awesome buy! Have found my face wash!
"I love this product! I tried a number of facial cleansers before I tried this one and they all irritated my skin. I saw this product at the store and since it's the only cleanser I could find that says it's formulated for sensitive skin, I decided to try it. This product went above and beyond my expectations! I would recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin!"
"i cannot believe i have waited so long to try olay's cleansers... i read all the good reviews so i thought id give it a try(i have used olay's moisturizers since middle school, im now 22) this sensitive foaming wash is amazing!! it's so incredibly gentle yet cleans so thoroughly(removed my mascara!!) i have acne-prone skin and i use an acne wash before this, i use this cleanser last because it leaves my skin feeling so smooth & soft and just plain healthy!! i recommend this wash to anyone & every skin type! you will love it!!"
Bought the Foaming Face Wash on 6/20/12 and used it that evening and was happy to see that my face was not dry. Woke up the next morning and it was still smooth and not dry or peeling. I have sensitive skin and purchased this product based on the reviews that I read. Believe me the product works and does not dry your skin. Will use from now.
I highly recommend the foaming face wash and moisturizing lotion for sensitive skin. I have eczema and this product is the only thing I have been able to use for many years. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft and not irritated. You can change the packaging but please don't ever change the formula.
"I have used many soaps and cleansers for my face over the years and none made my face feel good. Always left my face dry and tight with residue left behind. I decided to try this product and I am in love with it. My face feels brand new after using it. I am soooo happy they made this the way they did. I have extremely sensitive skin and I have to use Fragrance & Oil Free products. OLAY PLEASE, PLEASE never stop making this product!!! I will never use anything else ;)"
Love that it is oil free and fragrance free and does not irritate my skin at all. PLEEEAASSSE Dont ever change the formula in this product you just made me an Oil of Olay customer for life. I have tried everything and this is the best product Ive ever used and not to mention that it is inexpensive as well. Thanks guys keep up the good work.
"I enjoy this product because my breakdowns have certainly decreased BUT this product does not get all my makeup off on the first wash, which is really annoying for me. I do not wear a lot of makeup, and I always use a lot of this product to attempt to get it all off in one wash but it never works, always need a second application :/"
"Every facial cleanser I have ever tried left my skin dry, red, and full of zits. Olay Foaming Face Wash - Sensitive Skin leaves my face feeling soft, moisturized and clear of blemishes. I love this product and I will never try anything else again! Thank you Olay!"
"I have been using this product for years. It is a soft pearl like cleanser, which removes all makeup, dirt and oil. Your face feels so soft with this product. I Love that it is fragrance-free. My sensitive skin feels wonderful.. It is very hard to find a fragrance free product that performs like this one. GREAT CLEANSER"
"I forgot my usual dept. store cleanser while on vacation and found this inexpensive cleanser at a drugstore - been using it ever since. Great FRAGRANCE FREE cleanser I can use year-round (doesn't dry my skin out in the winter). Does not remove long-wearing makeup or mascara thoroughly, so I pair it with a washcloth and use a separate eye makeup remover."
"The only reason I don't give this product 5 stars is due to the container they put it in. I absolutely love how this foaming face wash makes my skin feel after I use it, and I have no sensitivity reactions to it at all. But I know that I will never get all of it out of the container due to the hard plastic container they put it in. I'm not sure if I'll get three-quarters of it out! Oil of Olay- please change your bottling method for this product!"
"I found this product through the book ""Don't go to the cosmetics counter without me"". It IS the best cleanser ever. Every other cleanser I use leaves my face dry, even ones for ""sensitive skin"". I would definately recommend this cleanser if you've been looking for one that is not drying. It also cleans your face very well. Thoroughly impressed. Hope they never stop making this!! Plus the price is great too!!"
Works great on all skin types. Would use this many times. Love it overall really cleanses my face!!
Very gentle but sometimes i have to wash my face twice before it feels like the day is removed.
I love using this foaming cleanser so much! It doesn't leave my skin feeling dry and stretched out!
I used this one before. I get sensitive skin in summer so I tried using this. It's alright.
Great for sensitive skin. Smell nice and not over powering. Foaming a lot and gentle for the skin.
Great foaming face wash. Left my face feeling fresh and super soft. Great for the price.
This product wasn't for me it left me a little dried. It wasn't what i was expecting !
Help with dark circles and puffiness. I use this brand right in the morning when I wake up
Love this face wash for my teenager. It's sensitive enough not to hurt his face and eyes.
Didn't feel like it cleaned my face. Left a film which was gross. I don't recommend at all
Hard to find. Available on the Walmart app. Good cleanser with out a lot of fragrance.
"I have a lot of issues with having sensitive skin, this wash is one I can use without looking like my face is covered in a painful rash."
"I have always been a huge fan of oil of Olay products, my mom swore by them. This particular cleanser is as gentle as they come. Great for sensitive skin!"
"Love this light weight cleanser. Very gentle on my sensitive skin. Only drawback is it doesn't remove 100% of my makeup, but still something I'd buy again"
I am actually using this now!! I absolutely adore Olay products and this one is no exception! It's free of dyes and does not dry out my skin or leave a film behind. No strong scent and really kind to sensitive skin!
I like this cleanser. It has no odor and lathers up nicely. I found it gentle and effective enough to use daily. I have purchased this a couple of times and am never disappointed. I would recommend as a value cleanser for sensitive skin.
"This olay face cleanser is a great product and a great price. It gets all my makeup off and leave my face feeling smooth fresh and no left behind dryness or residue. Does a great job, I am happy with this cleanser."
This product it's really good. It's a good cleanser if you have a sensitive skin. The first time I used it I saw the difference. I love it because a I have sensitive skin and this really works. I really recommend it
this olay gentle clean foaming face cleanser works super well for my skin and feels AMAZING. i use it in the shower and every morning and night and it's generally super good for sensitive skin. i would defiantly recommend.
This is definitely gentle on the face it's not a heavy feeling face cleanser it feels very gentle and it can be used on all skin types I have sensitive skin so this is something I definitely look for.
"I'd give this zero stars, if such an option existed. Skin felt grimy and unwashed after use. Grateful that I still had some Burt's Bees Foaming Face Wash to clean my face PROPERLY after using this product."
I have eczema and this is the one face cleaner my skin doesn't mind. It cleans off nicely and doesn't leave a film on my face. It is the only one I will use.
I have been using the oil minimizing clean for years only to not find any more. I tried the Gentle clean and I am not impressed. It's think and it does not foam or throughly clean my face.
"First you take away the foaming cleanser that so many, including myself, liked, then we try the the Gentle Clean, which is not quite as good, and now you reduce the package size? Looking elsewhere."
I have used this face wash for years and still love it BUT you just cut the tube size from 200 ml to 150 ml with no change in price (at least in my area no price decrease). That's a 35% price increase. Seriously.
"I've been using this for years and absolutely love it. I like the foaming because it makes me feel like I'm accomplishing something and it's fragrance free so it doesn't irritate my eyes. Mild, gentle, effective."
"This product is horrible compared to the original sensitive skin version I have used for years. It is drying my skin out, doesn't foam as well and doesn't leave me skin feeling clean. Please bring back the old version."
"Olay Gentle Clean is an excellent cleanser. Ir removes dirt, oil and makeup without making me feel stripped. I also love that it's fragrance free. I have very sensitive skin, and this is one of the few cleansers that I can use. Love It!"
"Great cleanser for sensitive skin and acne. Works great gets rid of make up and acne. The cleanser is also fragrance free, which makes it more awesome"

I have started using the Olay brand of face washes in the past couple of years and this brand is the only brand that seems to work for me. Very clean and smooth feeling after using this cleanser.
I have been using this for a few months now. I have really sensitive skin as well as mild acne. This doesn't make me break out or make my face dry or oily. Highly recommended.

I only use Olay foaming face wash and I use it faithfully. I have been for over 15 years. I get complaints on my skin all the time and I don't wear foundation. With Olay I have no need for makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is by far the best facial cleanser I've ever used. I have sensitive skin and I've always struggled to find a cleanser that does the job while leaving my face feeling soft. It's fantastic. I love it! :)
"I have tried Olay's NEW sensitive skin facial wash and it made my skin feel clean, soft and hydrated not dry. I LOVE the way it makes my face feel, it's like the original one with aloe vera and I am happy Olay has a fragrance-free product like this."
I love this product. I have sensitive skin and this worked for me. It left my skin feeling smooth and ALL my pimples are nearly gone. This is a good price. Doesn't dry out my skin also! Totally recommended! :)
I have used this facial wash and it cleansed my face and did not dry it out. My face felt GREAT after using this wash like it was cleaned yet NOT dried out.
"I bought this trying it for the first time and I love it!! My skin is not very sensitive but gets a lil reddish sometimes, so I thought this would be good since I love Olay products. It is good! Makes my face so soft and smooth and no more redness!!"
"I thought this product would be great since it's for sensitive skin. It made me break out terribly! I stopped using it, and my skin cleared up! Going in the trash, thanks for nothing."
"I have tried all of the fragrance free cleansers on the market and this by far is the best.The texture is so elegant and the way it glides over skin is beautiful,plus the price is a blessing!Please never discontinue this!"
This is my favorite face wash EVER! I use this every morning and night! It takes off all of my makeup without having to scrub or tug on my skin. With just a few days use my skin was much softer to the touch and it feels so much more clean and fresh.
"Perfect cleanser for my extremely sensitve skin. I have tried nearly every thing from drug store to department store, and this is the absolute best ! :)"
I stopped using this product after the first try. It dries skin terribly. Now I'm using express wet wipes - 1000 times better for me than this foaming wash.
No residue
works well
"The cleanser doesn't foam as much as desired but that's not the worst part. The worst part is the bottle. The lid doesn't seem to seal properly so overtime I pick it up product has leaked out and all over my counter. At first I thought maybe the bottle had been squeezed when I clasped the lid so there was a pressure build up that caused it to leak, but no. It leaks every time so I have to store it upside down. Will not buy again."
Why did you have to change a good product? I'm super disappointed that just when I finally found an affordable face wash for sensitive skin that removes makeup gently and thoroughly it's discontinued. New formula isn't as good as the old one. Stop changing everything we just want reliable products that work and won't be discontinued! Switching to neutrogena ultra gentle
"I bought the sensitive skin formula because I couldn't find the old foaming combination formula I used to buy and this was the only Olay face wash I could find at the store without scrubbing beads. The consistency is terrible, it doesn't spread or lather well. It doesn't remove makeup. Useless."
I've been a loyal user for too many years to count and absolutely loved the legacy formula. I do not like the changes that have been made. The new formula doesn't lather well and is irritating to the eyes. Just today I started a search in my local beauty store for a new brand. Please bring back the former product in both pump and tube.
This cleanser is gentle and effective.
Ive never used a better product. Thank you Olay !!! And thank you for making such a great product for skin like mine !!!
Very cleansing and refreshing on the face .really had my face feeling really great after every use . I don't really use it anymore.
I really did like this cleaning face cream. Didn't break me out and I saw a different In my face. I would buy it again
My regular go-to face wash. I've tried so many types of olay face washes and I love them all! This one is especially good because it isn't drying!
This cleanser feels so fresh and is so gentle that it can be used everyday. I feel like my face is always clean every time I use it
"I purchased two of these. The plunger on both bottles does not work. You push down once, but the plunger never returns. Must pull it up manually."

I have really sensitive skin so I am always on the hunt for a nice face cleanser that isn't super acidic and this one is great
I can't even use it. The bottle is so cheaply made that the cleanser won't come out of it. Waste of money.
Amazing gentle cleanser that is tough enough to remove my makeup without stripping my skins moisture barrier.
I have rosacea and sensitive skin--my whole life. This product cleans and gently exfoliates my skin--never harsh. It's a great product.

Pretty nice feeling it has a good smell I like the way it lathers and its not pricey at all
Have been using it for years and always like how it cleanses and makes my skin feel.
This product is the only thing that works on my skin to clear it up and makes it smooth and soft
You only need to use a tiny bit per cleansing. Not harsh or irritating.
