"I've been spending WAY TOO much money on toners. Since I've so pleased with other Olay products, I decided to give this a try and I'm very glad that I did. It's a gentle toner and my face feels soft and smooth after I apply it. Ready for my foundation."
This toner both removes dirt and remains of make-up as well as gently exfoliating skin. The product smells nice and does not sting like some toners do. Another good product from the labs at Olay!
"it just works. overall it's a great toner. I have sensitive skin and I have never had any irritation using this. I have purchased it over and over. I use it nightly after removing my makeup. I simply put some on a cotton pad and wipe it all over my face and neck. it takes off any residual dirt from my face, and removes whatever extra oil from the areas I need it. it smells great and doesn't burn or sting. my face always feels great after using it."
Works well for my skin type; not too harsh or drying. Hope you can keep this product in stock. Package received in very good condition as well as the product. The bottles and labeling were undamages and the bottles were in very good condition; not dirty or damaged. thank you.
This product is fantastic! Works well with use of toner without washing face if no time....Would definitely recommend.
"This product is everything and than some, for one it cleanse great, makes your skin feel sooo soft and smooth!! Love this a lot and it has a nice scent!"
"After waking my face, it feels tight and dry. This elements that sensation completely and gets my skin ready for moisturizer and makeup. I've used this product for a number of years and feel no need to ""shop around"". [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"got several of these because they are hard to find and I think is the best. feels clean after use - not too harsh, smells great and I can't say enough good things about Walmart packaging this time - they have finally learned how to ship liquids!! wsould definitely recommend"
I have oily and uneven textured skin and I have used everything from expensive face washes/toners to this and I have to say this works way better than any of the expensive stuff. I use this every night before bed and it makes my skin texture much more smooth and it deep cleans and removes all my makeup. I love this product and will keep using!
"On the first day I tried this (about a month ago), I had a pimple on my eyebrow ... used it in the morning ... by noon it was gone. Days later a whitehead also gone. Works fast and doesn't dry out my skin, dries quickly and completely nor doesn't leave any kind of ""residue"" like stickiness. Moisturizer is lovely"
For some reason I've been having trouble finding this product in my local stores. I have been using it for years however it was quite expensive online when shipping got involved. Found it on the WalMart site at great price for both product and shipping. Very pleased.
"Very nice toner to use after cleansing. It doesn't dry out my skin, and leaves my face feeling clean and toned."
"I have used several different toners lately. This one is okay for the price, its a bit strong and too fragrant, will try something else next time"
Well wrapped (so it wouldn't leak). Didn't have to go to the store to buy it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love Olay products. I am 59 and have used the moisturizer since I was in my teens. I wouldn't go a day without it. I love the Minimizing Toner. It makes my face feel so clean.
The store was out of my old toner so I decided to give this one a try. I already love it better then the old one. Will keep using. Would recommend to anyone
My face BURNS after using this product. I won't be buying again
use it all the time better than most...
"This is my first time using this toner. I recently switched because I could not find the toner I was originally using at my Walmart, so I chose this one. It smells refreshing and I can see some of my blemishes going away! It also make my face feel smooth which is a plus. I just wish it were a bigger bottle because I can see myself running out quick!"
Are you said every day is nice and refreshing in your face.
"My first time trying Olay oil minimizing, and I was very impressed with the results. My face feels relaxed and refreshed and clean every night. My skin is very sensitive and I am so glad this product has worked for me."
Burns eyes when using
"I really like this product, my skin is super oily and it easily removes the excess oil from my face without burning or leaving my skin feeling tight and dry. It feels really good on my face and I love how my skin feels balanced afterwards. Perfect. Good job olay :)"
"I know that I personally need a toner because I have acne-prone skin and it's very oily. So you know your skin so sure enough after I cleanse I use this toner and it removes all dead cells and impurities you can see it on the cottonball. It wasn't suggested to use a toner but, because I know my own skin I know I needed one. This one works well and it has low alcohol. I know it's hard to find one without but this seems to work. Give it a try."
"I have used this product along with other Olay products for years. My grandmother had beautiful skin and when I became a teen and started to have skin problems I asked her what her secret was and she simply said ""OLAY"". Since then I am a devoted fan and this is one of my must have products. I use it after I clean my face and it gets the makeup and dirt that my cleanser missed. It preps my face beautifully for moisturizer and make-up. It is also great for all skin types."
I've used this product as the second step in my daily cleansing program. When I apply this product after cleansing I feel my facial pores tighten and my face and neck feel refreshed and tight. It prepares my face for step three with Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream. My daily facial routine keep my face wrinkle free at 61 years old
It is one of the best buys for older folks with drying and aging skin that are on a fixed income. It is also highly recommended by my dermatologist [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use my toner after I used my Olay facial cleaner. It just makes me face feel refreshed. It never stings and feels so light but clean. It smells really fresh too.
"I have been struggling with very oily skin, blackheads, and slight acne for some time. Every product I had tried just didn't do what it said it would.I had never used a toner before, or even really knew what a toner is used for. I decided to give it a try, and I am extremely happy I did. I can't believe what a difference this product has made for my skin! I have only been using it for 4 days, twice a day and the results are amazing!"
This was hands down the best toner I could find then they changed the formula. Now it has a strong scent that's unbearable. I tend to go for unscented products since my skin is acne prone. Why mess up a good thing? The old formula kept my skin clear now I'm back at square one. So disappointing.
"I would like Olay to release a hydrating, anti-aging, toner. Not like this one, which is an old school type toner, which is designed to remove traces of makeup and dirt. Instead, a milky, hydrating toner designed to add a layer of hydration and plump the skin would be better. You can get an Olay Regenerist hydrating toner in China. I would like that product to be available in the US."
"The smell has changed but I feel like the formula have improved from when I last used it 2-3 years ago. I don't mind the smell. Decided to search for this toner due to minor acne and wow I used it and my pimple nearly popped itself. No more lingering dark spots from acne again. Does not dry my face and my skin is soft! Please don't ever discontinue this amazing toner. In fact, please please bring it back to stores!"
"I use this after the oil control cleanser & together they work wonders! Controls oil, stops breakouts, smooths skin, even makes my pores a little smaller. One bottle lasts about 2-3 months & the price can't be beat. Please don't change or discontinue this!"
I started using this products are reading all the great reviews. Im actually about to purchase my 3rd bottle!! I absolutely love this toner. I use it at night after I wash my face. It picks up any makeup residue left after I use my wipes or facial wash. I even use it on my neck area. Definitely recommend!! Doesnt dry out my skin and leaves it feeling refreshed and clean!!
"After more than 20 years of using this product, I must say good-bye. This was one of my favorite products because it evened my skin tone and had a refreshing scent. Then I bought a new bottle recently and realized Olay has changed the scent to an awful, cloying stench that is reminiscent of a peach wine cooler. It is so cloying it followed me around all day. It took a day or two for lingering scent to go away. I can't use this product anymore because of this. I'm so disappointed."
"I started using this about a week ago, and it's doing things NONE of my other cleaners have. My skin has cleared up a bunch since before using it. I haven't tried it as a makeup remover, per se, but this pulls SO MUCH DIRT off my face I had no idea accumulated. My face is a little less oily and it doesn't feel dried out. Great scent - would love a cucumber-style smelling one too."
"I have been using the oil of olay toner for years and years now. I have dry, sensitive skin and have issues with eczema on my face and eyelids. Washing my face with soap daily is too abrasive on my skin, but I keep my face fresh with this toner. I use it twice a daily. It has recently become very difficult to find in stores. I hope it's not becoming discontinued!!"
I tend to have oily skin and have tried many different toners. I decided to give this a try and it works the best for my skin. My face is less oily and feels soft. I didn't suffer any adverse reactions to using it. I'll continue to use this product for many years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Since I tried for the first time up to 4 years now, I couldn't believe how wonderful it is, It helps to keep controled oil excess on my face and take makeup away so great that I'm in love with this product. It's just so hard to find it because it's been removed from almost every store and I don't know why. So I had to start looking for it on the internet and keep using it for as long as it works for me."
"The Witch Hazel ingredient is a first for me. Love the way it feels after using it, twice a day. Doesn't dry out my skin either."
"I love Oil Minimizing Toner, I've been using it for years...People can believe I'm 45yrs..Thanks for helping me look young"
"Love this product. Just what I needed. It's very gentle, but does the trick. Cleans my face, but doesn't dry it out. And it smells amazing! My skin looked a lot brighter and smoother about a week after using regularly."
Tonight I did a mud mask. After washing it off I had to use 4 extra large cotton balls drenched in this toner to remove the remnants. It was scary to see what was left in my face after a mask. Love this product.
Love this leaves my face feeling clean and our free and doesn't have a strong scent only thing I don't like is the clean feeling doesn't last but about 4 hours for me before my face feels oily again I have fairly oily skin
"Toners often times irritate my skin, but I really love this Olay one. Olay's products in general don't irritate my skin and I was excited to find this helped also remove my foundation and lip stains without trouble either."
"My mom got me this product, along with a cleanser for Christmas. And I must say I am extremely pleased with it. It has a very gentle, beach my smell to it. My skin feels absolutely amazing. This is magic in a bottle. I LOVE it! Thank you❤️"
"I use this daily after washing my face. It helps diminish oil from my T-zone, and it feels so refreshing. Like a breath of fresh air for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for many years. It is a must have in my beauty regimen. I love the affordable price, and it's efficiency. I love how my skin looks and feels after using this toner. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This toner is great! It removes the hidden dirt and makeup and it doesn't sting the skin! The bottle should be alittle bigger so it will last longer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just bought this today and After using a few cotton balls and my skin feels GREAT!!! I use toners in the past but this one is the best one I use for the first time!! Will buy this again! Thanks!!
"I know there is a great debate about the necessity of toner, but I just don't feel like my face is clean unless I use this product. It feels so cool and refreshing -and isn't drying at all. The bottle sells for $3-4 and lasts me about six months."
This is a refreshing toner to follow-up the cleaning cloths without drying out the face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Using this product has made my brown spots look lighter and I my skin isn't so oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have extremely oily skin. Love the products Olay carries for oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After cleansing,this toner, when applied makes the skin feel even more refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just bought this--was looking for a kindler, gentler toner. So far, I like it, but it has an odd fragrance."
This stuff really cleans deep and helps keep my skin clear.
"Bought for my daughter who has very oily skin, she really likes it."
Why is there so much alcohol and fragrance in a toner meant to be applied on skin?
I love this item and what it does to my skin. It is very refreshing.
Absolutely love this product! I'm so glad I decided to give this a try. Only toner I'll ever use!!!
Another great product from Olay. Works perfect and flawless on oily skins such as mine.
This is always the toner I use and recommend to eliminate the last residue of grime from my face!
"Gentle, thorough, does a good job."
"I have used this product for many years, it is one of my favorites!"
Excellent!
Excellent!
