"Have only been using for a short time,but already notice some improvement in my skin texture and fine lines and it seems to actually give it an added glow in the AM which is an added plus!"
"I have tried many brands and types of cream and this one is a mix between a cream and serum. The cream makes my skin feel smooth, diminishes lines and my foundation goes on smoothly. I will be purchasing this product again and recommend it."
works great and feels so soft when applying
"This is my go-to moisturizer now, and I have been using it daily for a few years. After trying more expensive types, I found that this lotion does the same job, for a much lower price. I have oily/ combination skin, and wear make-up daily. This lotion helps foundation go on smoothly, so that you actually can use very little make-up. Seriously, I wouldn't be without this product now!"
"This is the best combination lotion and serum I have used. It lasts awhile so it is not too expensive for the amount paid, actually well worth it a serum is recommended for a facial product. Their is no SPF but it works well for my intended purpose."
"No greasy feel, works fabulous! Read the research and development! It's the best for the money!"
I've been using this for only a week. I love this. Goes on like silk. Smells beautiful. Dry patches around my eyes that I could t get rid of are gone. My skin is smoother. Softer.
"I have used this product for four to five years now. Occasionally I would try something else but this is my go-to face product. I am 68 years old, my skin looks alive, and wrinkles are few (but of course, well deserved). I do have trouble now finding it stores which can be quite aggravating as I am not a fan of online buying, but I digress, the product is wonderful."
Excellent product. I'm a fourth-generation all of Olay user and this is by far the best product I've ever ever tried and I will for ever use it you just have to try it after you put the product on your face it feels awesome and then your hands also feel wonderful if it weren't so expensive I wouldn't use it all over my body
I Use this product day and night because it's that amazing. I wanted to try a drugstore moisturizer and this one sold me because my skin looks plump and healthy I apply this and get glowing skin. Plus it's not on the expensive side. Most oily moisturizers go for about $15-25.00 this one is about $11 and a little goes a long way. This moisturizer is also good for prepping the skin before make up because it makes my smile lines smooth and not viable
"I love it! I have oily sensetiv skin and this Olay facial moisturizers 2 in 1 is great for me .Not greasy,soft fragrance and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, it goes on really light but does the job of a heavier moisturizers. My skin feels more smoother and healthy. It would be amazing if they added a SPF in it .Who is looking for not so expensive and good facial moisturizers I really recommend it!"
"I am 52 and this two in one wrinkle cream is accommodating a smooth look and the feel and texture is amazingly refreshing. Purple is my favorite color so I love the container it is in, also small and compact if I go on an overnight. I definitely recommend this product."
This product made my skin feel amazing and rejuvenating. I would recommend this to anybody with Fine Lines or crow's-feet starting. It makes your face feel all tight. I would definitely recommend it to anybody out there. I'm in love with it still use everyday Olay Total Effects Tone Correcting Eye Treatment ❤️❤️❤️
Only brand is Only brand is really good It's good I love the body wash I have a really tried the facial but I'm pretty sure is good but only for hair it's really really good smells good is changed behavior and I bet they have really good you should really try
"To be honest I have only used this product for 8 days so give it 5 stars was hard. my face looks a little better but will have too see, But then I love Olay products . My skin was in very bad shape so i'm hoping olay products can solve the Major winkles..."
"Tried this on a whim, as I've tried other Olay products in the past. I was not disappointed. It definitely did the trick. I'm not sure i would try it again because i think there may be another product out there just as effective that may be more bang for my buck!"
"Love this! Make my skin feel amazing, so soft. I used another product years ago, by Olay but I believe they stopped making it because I haven't seen it in ages. I have been using this ever since. I wish this came in a larger size, or possibly better packaging, I find myself tearing it open to get every ounce of product left in there. Overall works good, but Love Olay Anything!"
"It makes my skin so soft, very absorbent. I love it so much I bought one for my daughter"
Smooth lotion. No overwhelming smell. Best face lotion I have ever used.
"Like the idea of using only one product for 2 functions. I have only used a few days, but Olay products I generally love. Price is right."
I have been buying this lotion for a lot of time. It is soft and silky . I use it day and night. It is really perfect!
This product/serum is perfect to put on before applying makeup or anytime. It makes my skin feel so velvety soft and it's lightweight. Will definitely be purchasing again.
I saw absolutely no difference. I don't have many wrinkles (my skin is fairly young) so I let my mom try it out (her skin is more aged) and it did nothing for her. It was disappointing. Lots of room for improvement.
"Use this cream twice a day, feels lovely and smooth on the skin. Absorbs quickly leaving a nice smooth surface. A little goes a long way and lasts ages, part of my daily routine. Comes in cute little bottle"
My entire family of women swears by Okay. It's so wonderfully hydrating without making me look like an oily mess in the Florida humidity! It makes my skin look firm and glowy and I can never feel it's weight! I am a forever user of this cream!
This is okay I think it promises more than it delivers but it is still a nice moisturizer the bottle is nice and it smells good I wouldn't have my friends but it though it is also a little pricy
I absolutely love this eye cream and serum the box is super cute also but It was a little pricey it was $19.99 but it was definitely worth it it's gentle and smells nice and it doesn't leave my face sticky or oily
This keeps me looking young. It helps with fine lines on forehead and around the eyes. Very effective with only using a little bit. It exceeds all my expectations. Recommend.
Very good product leaves my face feeling so soft and smooth and it has a very pleasant smell. I have noticed my wrinkles are smaller and my dark spots are starting to fade. I will be buying more so as to keep my face looking young
I bought this for the purpose of everyone telling me you need to start using anti-wrinkle cream when youre young to prevent wrinkles. I used the product for a while but kind of just left it on the shelf and never picked it back up.
"I have used this product for a long time around my eyes and in my smile creases. People who have known me for many, many years have been surprised when I tell them my age. They usually mistake me for 10-20 years younger."
"Heavy oily feeling, no real difference in skin tone, brightness or clarity. Packaging was pretty and also hard to get into without cutting tape. So that is one good thing. I know my products were not messed with on the shelf."
"I got a sample of this from a magazine. It went on without too greasy. Smooth, cool feeling. The next day, I had smooth skin, pores were not that noticeable. I don't think I looked younger, but to others possibly. No major puffiness under eyes. I do recommend you try before you buy. I love Oil of Play products, so I would buy. Sorry, no picture. Sample a while ago."
Olay!! I absolutely love Olays products from making to cleansing products! I went to try this product specifically out and I like it but not exactly love it. It works but the price compared the cheaper and effective equality. Try this but try the cheaper ones as well!
I was given a sample of this and to my surprise I loved it . it felt good on my skin. It s long lasting as well . all day all night. It might just be me as when I wear make up I do not need to retouch it most of the time. But i love the feel of this one product
Works very well leaving skin feeling soft and moisturized
Not worth the price and does not do anything for my skin.
I ordered more already . Excellent product . Highly recommended
This product seems to smooth out the crinkles and wrinkles quite well Just a little application does the trick
"This item is great in the winter, it is heavy enough for winter dry skin without clogging my pores. Goes on silky so my makeup goes on smooth."
Loved it Helped with fine lines and wrinkles. Would recommend First time user will be purchasing again. Good value for money. Not to pricey.
Went on nice and smooth didn't leave my skin feeling greasy or oily had a nice smell and it's a true classic
Im all a out anti aging creama. This olay day cream is so good. I love it and cant have enough of it. I apply on my face let it dry.
It worked amazing on my skin. I highly recommend this product. It left my skin feeling amazing and brand new.
Love this product works really great! Used it once daily at night after my showers. Leaves my face feeling so smooth and soft the next day
Love this product! Helps so much with moisturizing and fine wrinkles. I use it every morning and every night.
"I loved the way my skin felt, I also used it on my hands, it made my hands look healthier, and elegant! It had a nice light scent!"
It's amazing! It makes the skin feel soft and fresh and is great too prevent wrinkles. You'll love it
It's an OK product in my opinion. It's a great option if you're in a budget! Gentle and you won't see immediate results but it's better than nothing
I have very sensitive skin but this product did not cause any breakouts. I really liked it and I think it made my skin look younger and fresher.
Once applied to the skin it does a very good job with keeping it nice smooth and looking tight highly recommended for All skin Types
I can't say that I had any noticeable results. No visible improvements or concealed deep wrinkles. It was fairly priced.
So they say you should start using anti- aging products when you turn 25....apparently I found out when I was 28 . I swear by this eye-cream. It makes the sensitive skin around the eye super dewy and ensures it doesnt get dry and brittle.
My skin is a mixture of dry and oily but this cream is great! Fixes my dry skin without making my face overly oily. Its also great because I have sensitive skin and its real gental.
"My mother use this on her face and it really help the small wrinkle in on her face, I would like to try it for myself just to see if I will get the same results"
So i used this like 6 months ago.. i did feel like it did something but it was not permanant i noticed that after few hours it just faded away.. iam still hunting for some good eye creams iam not happy with any
This is my go to cream in the mornings. Ive used the older formula and would like to test this new one to see if it still holds up to my standards that the old formula used to. Definitely would recommend and its not pricey
Lightweight moisturizer perfect for sensitive skin. I can't say that I've seen a difference in regards to wrinkles but I've been using this moisturizer for a few years now. It's great for day and night use and it's very affordable.
Makes my face feel hydrated and soft. Great drug store purchase. As for fine lines and wrinkles I haven't seen much improvement over the last year of using this product.
I tried this as I noticed my skin changing and noticed some wrinkles start. I love it. It really hard to buy as the price is a bit much but splurge on it occasionally
This age-defying two-in-one anti-wrinkle day cream it's amazing not so crazy it does come in a box as its Packaging remember when you're washing your face you want to do it with cold water or fresh water so it also keeps your face nice and
"So glad about this products. Works wonders. I'm in my 60's looking young, most of the time people think Im younger. I receive many compliments on skin."
"This stuff is the absolute best out there, doesn't pill on skin underneath makeup or bare face and no pasty white face either, so so so soothing! love olay!! can't live without this,good stuff!"
"I don't normally take the time to review a product however I feel I have to. This is truly one of the best products I have ever used on my face. I think my skin looks smooth, healthy and soft. I am wearing much less makeup then I used to!"
Love this stuff!
does what it claims
"I use olay for many reasons. Skin care is a must in my life and I thought it was worth a try. It is non greasy so it works great to be a moisturizer for premakeup. I honestly don't think I pronounce the ingredients but that's nothing new in most skin care! It's such a good product, but the reason it is not great is because of the perfume smell that they added. Remove half of the perfume and we would be good to go to great!!! I just don't prefer it but some might so for them I highly recommend because it works very well."
"I have just purchased my second bottle of “Age Defying 2 in 1 Anti Wrinkle Day Cream & Serum”, I love this stuff. I am retired from working in a cosmetics department in a major department store for 8 years, & represented many famous companies. I have to say that this cream is the best I've used. It feels like silk and has improved my skin immensely. My skin feels smooth & soft and any wrinkles I had, have faded enough to notice. I also use other Olay & Cover Girl products."
It's soo beautiful and lovely I like it soo much because I like this package it's wonderful serum
Love love love it is a very good serum it very smooth leaves skin and works great under makeup
It makes a difference when I put in on and I can put it on between serums and moisturizer.
"Seems to work well, only been using it for a week."
im aging and this cream is a life saver my face is so soft so beautiful i love it.
Oil of Olay is absolutely one of my top rated products.The age cream has been a lifesaver for me.
"Very light weight for daytime use, non oily, great price"
"amazing, love the texture and how it fades on my face. I think its good to have a olay eye cream. For me one of the bests"
This cream is so soft and smooth but doesnt clog pores. I use it at night after washing and in the morning before makeup.
I am not a farcical person by far. I love this because my face doesnt feel dry and feels like I still look young for my age.
I love the way this makes my skin feel it's so amazing and it smells so good n makes everything smell good and doesn't leave greecey hands
I love Oil of Olay so much. Their products really work. This stuff keeps my skin looking smoother and younger everyday.
A very good anti wrinkle moisturizer. Melts in the skin without leaving a sticky feel. I have a combination skin and I am 31.
This serum actually works on my skin. I've tried numerous different types of serums and this seems to do the trick. I recommend.
The price is unbeatable and the it delivers on its anti-aging promises. I use it when I feel like a change and it works!
"It was really good, it takes a little longer to see the results but it's still awesome and it feels great"
Love it you see the difference on the first day so light I can use my make up with no problem at all
I'm a little young to have wrinkles but this Olay age defining anti-wrinkle cream really helps moisturize my face! I have very dry skin on my face and ever since I started using this I have no problems with my skin on my face!!
I would rate this product as good or better than any high dollar product. I bought this in a pinch and loved it! Coupons for this product can also be found online or in store
It was pretty basic. I was not a fan of the formula. It left a sticky residue to me. It was tacky to the touch. I used it for a month and did not really feel or see a difference. I probably won't be buying again.
I have been using this product for almost 6 months now. It does great to my skin. I apply it first then put another moisturizer +spf and it blends well with any product I use.
Have used this for a few years now... can't not get in Canada any more...great to find it.... makes a great light face cream with no greasy after feel but skin not tight and dry... perfect
I like Olay products and this one is a keeper! I don't have a lot of wrinkles but I do have a wonderful set of elevens on my forehead( makes me look angry) and this cream/ serum does work pretty well. It isn't greasy for a wrinkle cream and absorbs quite quickly. It has a light fragrance which I don't mind at all. Great product for a fraction of the cost of spa/ salon product.
"For what you pay for it's a very good product, I used it a few times because I dont need it that much so I gave it to my mom she seams to like it but we haven't noticed a big diffrence, it may be because she hasen't used it for to long but it does tighten the skin a bit."
I was looking for a budget friendly wrinkle serum to help with fine lines. This was a good pick. It was a little watery and in felt like I needed to use more product to cover my face. But i liked how it felt on my skin. The scent was great and it seemed to do annoy job of helping with wrinkles like I wanted it to
"I have Very Sensitive, Dry, Combination skin. It has been a battle findibg something anything until I saw this at store, for the price I said why not, tried it all anyways. This is Amazing! I noticed fine lines diminished, texture of my skin was in shambles this cleared it, evened it out and Hydrated it without drying feeling. I'm in awe of this product and highly recommend it to everyone."
"This is the absolute BEST under make-up cream I have ever found, and I truly can't stand to be without it!! The only problem is that I have always been able to buy it in stores, but have recently found that it is not available in the stores I have always purchased it in. I just placed an order online, but why would this not be available in stores?!?! This product makes my face look absolutely as flawless as it can look after applying make-up, I hope Oil of Olay NEVER stops making it!!!"
This product became hard to find. It really works for me because it absorbs quickly and it doesn't have SPF in it which causes more oiliness and deeper eye lines. I have found it at Walmart and hope it will be available for a long time. It works for oily skin.
"My skin literally sucks this product in, everyone notices how healthy, dewy, and wrinkle free my face is when I use this particular product. It's not greasy at all, it's light, perfect to wear under makeup, or just to run errands! I don't know what I would do without this product! Trust me this is a MUST BUY, and add into your daily routine. I also use Olay eyes, and Olay night 7x cream! Can't live without!!!!"
"Best face cream ever concerning the fragrance, the no greasy feeling, the easy absorption, the SPF content and the non irritating ingredients concerning the eyes and the skin surrounding the eyes. I will forever hate you if you stop producing and selling this face cream. JUST DO NOT STOP Producing IT!!!"
"If you have oily skin, you may want to think twice before purchasing. It leaves my faces a little sticky. I have combination skin. Extremes of both so I use this as a spot moisturizer so my entire face doesn't feel to heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have extremely dry skin, especially in the winter months. I've tried an enormous amount of different moisturizers for my face, not to mention how much money I've wasted. I'd definitely have to admit, I've found the absolute best product for my skin! Thanks Olay, you have no idea how truly grateful I am!"
Love this product! Very convenient to use and you are definitely able to see results !
Great light cream that does what it says it is going to do . Great price too . Like dior creams
"I'm in love with this product, I see results in few weeks and I would love to use it again"
nice one love iiit Great looks the best cream serum nice one love iiit nice one love iiit
I love this product. It feels silky when you put it on your face and blends in quickly.
"This product is awesome! Top 5 for sure. It really does help with the appearance of wrinkles, of course, after consistent use."
My mom actually uses this. Not me. But she likes it and she thinks it works good. Does not make her skin oil and it's not too harsh. But long ways goes a long way. So don't over use it or it will go long ways.
I have only been using this for about a month and have not found any major changes yet. There is nothing special about the packaging. I plan on giving it another month or so. At that point I can say whether or not a need for improvement.
"Just started using it about a week ago, don't know how I feel about it yet.. so far I noticed it doesn't strip my skin of its oil... Only time will tell"
Loved this cream serum duo. It really helped my skin look softer plus moisturized it well. The cream felt rich and luxurious and I really liked this product.
"I have very small eye wrinkles forming, so I purchased this to try. LOVE IT! They are gone, and so is the tiny one that had stared to form on my forehead."
"This moisturizer is the best I've found. It is creamy and it leaves my skin soft all day, wipes out wrinkles and even softens the skin on my arms. I would recommend this cream for all women."
The ingredients leave a thin white film on your skin after a few hours. Kind of like dried egg whites or something of that nature. Would not buy again. I am pondering taking it back and get my money back. Didn't work for me.
"As a African American women of dark complexion, I'm always looking for skin care products that make melook young soft and rejuvenated. Especially since i am also a third shift warehouse worker i love love love Oil Olay and this one of my favorite"
Use it daily after cleansing and it feels so light and fresh. Cant get enough of Olay. Started using Olay at 16 and you have progressed with products as I have aged. Im a beautiful 51 years young! Thanks Olay
"But why is it not available? I love this product. My skin always looks healthy. The combination of daily cream and serum is not heavy on my face which all other products seems to be. But again, where is it to buy?"
This cream allows me more days with no makeup. My skin glows and it looks better bare. I do wish it had sunscreen in it though. I love the light scent.
"I love using Olay because of how it feels on my skin and I go in a circular position putting it on.An makes me face feel tightened right then.Also the serum makes my eyes look an feel no wrikles.THANK YOU,AN GOD BLESS KELLY.DAILEY DAILEY."
This is the best product I used for my face. After using it once I can see a difference in the texture of my face. My face looks smoother and healthier. Highly recommended.
Product has way too much fragrance and shimmer in it! It didn't even help out with dryness on my skin and turned my face bright red. Normally I LOVE olay products but I am EXTREMELY disappointed in this one.
I am older with dry skin this seems to really help I have tried other products but this one is much better for my skin and other people seem to notice [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the Olay Age Defying collection, especially the serum. I love the light feel of it and the way it soaks in fast leaving my face feel fresh! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin has never been so smoothed and hydrated. I've tried many moisturizers but none compare to this product, especially if you have dry skin and fine lines."
I highly recommend this product to use everyday. I use it every morning and evening. Does not leave my skin greasy. Feels light and feels moisturized.
I love to put this product on before I put my makeup on for a light base. I would recommend it.
My mom used this for her face and it helped her bc she does have some fine lines. It works great
"Love it, no greasy feel, smells great and makes my skin soft. I started to see results in as little as 2 weeks and I sware by it!"
This anti aging cream works great I noticed the effects immediately ... I noticed it reduced my wrinkles were less promonate
I have started using this under my eyes on my freckles and it has not only made my skin tighter but made my skin more even which I did not expect!
"Slightly oily feeling at first but is light and luxurious, leaves your skin feeling soft and refreshed. null"
This product was light weight and worked great and I actually saw results. It's a great price and easy to find.
Love this product. I use this every night and morning to help with my skin hydration as well as future aging.
I love this moisturizer! it smells really good and leaves your arms and body feeling very moisturized.
Love these I keep a bottle at home and in my gym bag. Good price and works great . Everyone would think these are great .
I made 3 times purchased for this item. Thiswork very good on combination skin. It makes your skin smooth and fre
"Just started using this product a few days ago. I'm not really sure how good it works, though I have read alot of positive reviews on here. I will update on about a month or so to to give my opinion."
Did notice a little improvement Will try a stronger Olay product nex time I make purchase
skin feels nice and soft..dont know about wrinkle reduction yet...
My go to serum. Sorta fragrant but gets the job done. It is sorta expensive though but worth a try
It goes on smoothly and skin feels so soft. Will buy again.
great price...great moisturizer for daily use
"The serum helps this product really absorb into my skin for a smooth, nongreasy feel."
This product seems to soften harsh facial lines. Skin feels younger after first use.
I felt that this product gave me smoother more attractive skin
Just tried this after using No. 7 which I love but this is much cheaper so thought I would give it a try.
I have used this product for a couple of years and I love the way it makes my face feel!
