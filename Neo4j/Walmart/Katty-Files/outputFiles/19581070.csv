I love this cream my face feel like silk.
This night moisturizer has provided me with excellent results!! I use to always battle discoloration with other products and none of them worked so well for me. Within the first week of consistent use of this creme I seen results! My mom liked how my skin looked so much she went out and purchased it herself. This is definitely a keeper!
Great product...but am I the only one that has trouble putting the lid back on after I use it....such a pain in the butt....wish they would change the lid design
I love this product. Makes my face soft and fades the age spots a little.
This cream not only gave me soft skin and toned complexion but cleared up my acne as well and its only been a week!!! I can't wait to see what the product does further down the line.
"This is a non-greasy cream which keeps my skin soft & subtle. It seems to fade the brown spots over time, though they do not completely disappear. I usually apply sparingly to ensure better absorption. I use it routinely, though sometimes I do rotate & alternate with other products that I find equally effective. I have very few wrinkles, if any."
I used to use this product but it has a lot of chemicals in it and i think all natural would be better
"I used it for the first time last night, loved the way it felt on my face but the strong ""flowery"" smell would NOT go away, nauseating! I am 51 years old and never tried a face product that the smell made me sick to smell it. Then this morning I put it on about 2 hours ago and the fragrance is STILL strong. I will be returning it ONLY because of the STRONG flowery smell."
Very moisturizing throughout the night. Gave skin a nice glow!
