This cream was the product of the month in Good Housekeeping magazine. So. I thought I would give it a try. I have oily skin and large pores with dry patches. I will be 60 years old in a few days and I think my skin is looking pretty okay. I am almost done with my first jar and I will buy another.
"I have been using Roc since 2016, I have had great results, I can't think using any other products. Before I tried it, I made sure to read all the instruction, I don't have any bad reactions. I am telling my friend and family members to give it a try."
I am likeing some of the results...but around my eyes it actually looks like there are more wrinkles??? Especially my under eye...it does tighten the skin around your eyes which I like but I am concerned about the apperance of wrinkles I didnt have before...anyone else experience this???
"After researching products containing retinol I decided to purchase ROC since I had used another skin care products from this company. Initial application no problem, but after using it a couple of days my face felt like it was burning with severe redness. I couldn't wash it off fast enough, and it took hours for the burning to wear off."
"As stated I've used other products from this company with no problem, but I don't recommend this one."
"I purchased the Roc Max moisturizer with high Hope's. As it turned out I have a rash on My face neck and chest,everywhere I applied it..very disappointed and unsure when theis rash will clear up"
I bought ROC Max thinking I'd try it. Used it very sparingly and developed what appeared to be skin burns on my face and neck. I must admit I did not read the directions thoroughly before use and did not research it on line. If I had read many of these reviews I would not have purchased the product. I have had to slowly nurse my skin back and refrain from any possible irritants near my face.
I have a full jar of expensive useless product that I wouldn't even give to anyone.
"I've used Roc products and retinol products without any trouble in the past, but I had a very bad reaction with this one. After only a couple of uses, leaving a day in between, I had what looked and felt like burned areas of my skin. These areas became so sensitive that it hurt to wash my face even with just water. I tried putting lotion on to soothe it, but that was also very painful. The areas that were not burned became very dry and itchy. Very disappointing as I now have a full container that I paid for and can't use."
"I bought this thinking i was going to get great results. The first day there was a burn on my eye lids and around my crows feet. Day two it hurt super duper bad to the point i had to wipe it off, i couldn't go for a day 3 and now have chemical burns on my eyes. In my quest for the fountain of youth, i got swollen skin and more wrinkles. Yay."
This product is intense! I love how it makes my skin peel that's what you get when you pay for a professional chemical peel. People Always think my skin is not real because of how flawless it is and I have roc to thank. I use the entire line of roc max and the retinol serum. Remember if you don't see irritation you don't have a product worth using. Please keep this product forever it's the best thing ever!!!! Thank you roc :)
"It cream keeps my skin smooth and soft. My deep wrinkles are still here, though ."
I have sensitive skin. I bought the daily hydration creme hoping it would help with dry skin and some smaller wrinkles. I got an uncomfortable rash and splotches.
"DO NOT BUY IT!! it's a disaster. It couldn't be a product for skin!! After only three days of using it, the skin around my eyes burnt and became very swollen. The manufacturer should be sued."
"This product made my face red, and it burns and it's also pealing after 4the day of using it. I thought I would go away if I use it a little longer. But it's worst."
I bought this product about 5 days ago. I notice a burning feeling but did go away. What I really notice DO NIT USE IT AROUND YOUR EYES!!! My eyes are very puff and burn and I have creases I never had before. I hope this will go away!!! Will not lurches this again. I wanted something to decrease my puffiness and wrinkles. Not make it worse.
"I was astounded by the results I got with this cream in only two weeks! My skin tone was evened out, wrinkles diminished and sagging skin largely minimized. This product spreads over the skin with no greasiness and is absorbed quickly. I experienced no skin irritation and it has a very pleasant scent as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am very upset with this creme, my face looks like it has be burned"
My skin has been so dry with fine lines. I have been using this product for 2 weeks and the result already are amazing! It has re hydrated my skin beautifully and the fine lines have disappeared I also feel it's brightened my face all without clogging my pores. I love this cream!
"For as pricey as this stuff is, you would hope it would work and the burning and irritation would be worth the sacrifice in order to eventually get results. Unfortunately, this product does not work (I used for a grueling 6 weeks) and I wound up looking even puffier then previously and my eyes burned as well. Trash it and put some soothing cold tea bags under your eyes. They are cheap and much more effective. I just wish I could get my $ back."
"I used this product twice, every other day. Under my eye is red bumps, itchy and hanging wrinkles! I look horrible! It's been three days since I used it and it hasn't cleared up yet! any suggestions? I'm putting cortisone on it, and ice."
"I simply love this product. I have tried other products out there through the years and honestly, they always left my skin feeling greasy. Because I already have naturally oily skin, this product does not leave it feeling oily or greasy, just fantastically moisturized. My lines are minimal and wrinkles practically non existent. I'm 56 years old and people mistaken me for my early to mid 40's! I wouldn't use anything else!"
I wish you would package this great product in a tube instead of a jar ... I feel that all the ingredients loose their potency and can also be contaminated by the users using their fingers to grab the product from the jar ... I truly believe cosmetic companies shouldn't use jars anymore.
Thank you though for your great and very efficient products
"I toggle back and forth between this product and Porcelana (for uneven skin tone). I wanted a cream and this is great... for NIGHT. What I really need now is this product in SPF 30 so I don't have yo use a third separate product in the morning (over top my Boots serum). Please say it's in the pipe, ROC(?)."
I like the cream itself; it is thick and goes on smoothly.
I'm not sure how it will work in the long term because I cannot tolerate the heavy fragrance. I don't know why such heavy perfume is used in a face cream. I would rather smell the ingredients the perfume is trying to mask than this strong scent. I wish I could use the product.
I have been using RoC products for many years. I will turn 66 in December and people cannot believe how young I look. It is amazing for fine lines around my lips and my eyes.My skin feels soft and supple.I use the products on my neck and chest and it helps with discoloration. I recommend this RoC to everyone who ask me what I use. Thank you RoC for your wonderful products.
"In addition to the many great features of this product I wish to add that it has been given the Good Housekeeping seal of approval. GH stands behind their approval seals and, to me, that's an important recommendation. It was because of this I decided to try this product and I LOVE IT and the results I get!"
"I am a 34 year old woman and have been using RoC products since well before my 30's. I get so many compliments about my skin tone from people once they find out how old I am. I tell everyone that along with protecting my skin from the sun, and not smoking, that RoC is to thank for my youthful skin and lack of crows feet. If they ever think about having a brand ambassador program, I'd be totally on board!!"
I received a free sample of RoC Retinol Correxion May Daily Hydration and I absolutely loved it. Right away my skin looked brighter and it did not feel dry at all. I have been skeptical of trying products with retinol and I hate that I have not tried it before. This will be part of my daily facial routine from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am so impressed with the results of RoC RETINOL CORREXION MAX Daily Hydration Creme, my skin feels smooth and supple, fine lines are diminish. I will be purchasing the complete line very soon. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to try a product i didn't know about. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I purchased this product because it had good reviews however I just looked at the reviews overall and did not read the reviews.
"I have been using for 3 days now and my face has started burning and is very irritated, I looked at some of the reviews and I now see that others are having the same issue. This product may be to strong for my skin so I will not use it again."
Great product- the retinol in it does wonders for your skin making it soft and clears pores. It goes on so creamy and feels so good on. I use it under makeup. I also use a dab of olive oil on my very dry skin areas on my face such as my forehead and neck first and then apply the face cream.
"I have been using RoC RETINOL CORRECTION MAX DAILY HYDRATION CREME for almost two weeks. My face was very dry before I started using this product. Now my face looks healthy and smooth. Feels great on my skin, not greasy or thick. Will be using this daily from now on. Would highly recommend this to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It goes on smooth and has an amazing fragrance. My skin feels soft and the appearance of fine lines has decreased with use. You don't need to use a lot of it to do the job! I will be buying more of this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have just started using this Creme- and I am hoping it will reduce my wrinkles dramatically! I'm a little concerned about the retinol in it- but here's hoping no problems with it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So far I really like this. Have only been using it about a week or so but I love how it feels putting it on and it does a great job moisturizing my face.
"I normally use a moisturizer twiceca day, under makeup in the morning and before bedtime in the evening. This product says to use only once a day. Should I use a different moisturizer in the morning?"
"The RoC retinol product left my face a little greasy; which, is something I don't like. The feeling didn't last long though, and I did see less wrinkles after a week of using it."
I love how it makes my skin feel and look and I also love how it blends well in my s kin and it's fading my dark spots on my face [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this cream. It doesn't block my pores. It is quickly absorbed into my skin. The major plus it that it works!
I took pics to compare and my skin looks and feels better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Like the way my face felt, did make wrinkles less visible around eyes"
"like that not much fragrance,since my face is on the oily side it was a bet greasy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this product for only a week and saw signs that the wrinkles on my face were less noticeable. My skin hasn't looked this good in years!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the ROC products for 7 years. It took several months to “kick in” but once it did there was a noticeable improvement. I get compliments regularly. The products are amazing & I highly recommend them.
I was excited to try this product after reading that Roc has made the top list of best wrinkle creams on just about all lists out there. I picked up this item but the jar was full of a watery substance almost half was water and half product. I'm not sure if this is normal? I poured out the water and used the bit I had which I liked but didn't have enough to really see a difference but I know my skin can tolerate it. The product is too expensive for me to only get about half a jar. Anyone else have this problem?
Pricing is better than anyplace else at this time.
"After trying Roc Retinol and for just 1 week, I noticed a significant change to my fine lines . I also noticed a nice change and tightened neck. I will definitely continue using this amazing product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Have tried multiple other brands, but ROC actually lives up to its claims. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Start off slow if you are not used to retinol and stick with it. It's a bargain!
ROC Hydration is a very good product. When you start using it you will feel and see the difference in a few applications.
I've been using RoC products for years and I have never been disappointed I only recently started using Hydration cream and love it!! It's perfect!!
"Used for a week and boy my skin is so smooth, glowing and leaves no greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Very versatile Anti aging skin cream keeps skin deeply moisturized
I spend my free time golfing and fishing. This intense anti-aging cream will definitely reduce my dark spots and help with my slight wrinkles near my eyes. Great product - thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was very hopeful for great results from this product. Unfortunately it left my face and neck with a terrible rash like it had been burnt - must be allergic to some of its ingredients
"I have used other ROC skin products with good results including facial creams with retinol. Anything else, for example vitamin C, causes painful breakouts on my face. This particular retinol product, however, had the same bad effects as some other creams. I'm not sure what ingredient makes this ""Max"" but I would warn other people who have sensitive skin to non-retinol products to stay away from this one."
"I long been a fan of RoC products but this was the first time I've tried RoC Retinol Correxion Max Daily Hydration Crème. I am very happy with my results, even after just a week of using it. I'm sure as I continue to use this crème I will get even better results. But even after a week my skin feels softer and smoother and fine lines seem reduced. I also appreciate the light scent, it's not overpowering [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Feels nice on my face and makes me look a little more youthful in appearance! Not crazy about the fragrance, but not terrible!"
"It keeps my skin hydrated, but have yet to see any reduction in fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this and been using for about a week. It has really dried my skin out. I was hoping it would moisturize. It does when you first put on and then it seems to dry out my skin more than it was.
I used this for 3 days. After the 3rd day the area under my eye looked like I had a sunburn and it felt like it too. There were also patches of white like my skin had been bleached.
The is a very smooth and light facial cream. Applying it once in the morning kept my skin feeling soft and supple all day long. I actually noticed some very fine lines around my eyes being smoothed out as well after using for 2 weeks. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Para empezar tenia mis dudas pues tengo rosacea y mi piel es muy seca, tirante y algunas lineas de expresión. Desde que empecé a utilizar la crema de RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® MAX Daily Hydration Crème, he visto mejoria, mi piel se siente suave e hidratada y menos tirante; me gusta pues mi cara no se siente grasosa. Espero ver mayores resultados en 8 semanas. Gracias [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I'm loving this RoC Retinol Correxion MAX Daily Hydration Creme. It hydrates all day and smoothen my skin. Just started to use it so will need more time to see the visible difference but will continue and hopefully will see the good results in a few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've seen improvement in my skin quickly! My skin feels hydrated, plump and refreshed. Absorbs quickly and is lightweight! There is a scent, but, it's not strong and it dissipates quickly. I've noticed my fine lines appear diminished. I see some lightening with my dark spots. It's not heavy or blocks my pores. My skin looks more youthful, has a glow! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this cream for a few weeks now, at first I just used it at night now I'm using in the morning also under 15spf. My fine lines are a little softer but the biggest change is that my face has some noticeable radiance. It's a big change from my old dull skin. I will definitely buy and continue to use this daily hydration Crome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Roc Retinol Correxion Mad daily hydration crème is a great product. I like the way it goes on, it feels smooth and feels like it melts into my skin. It made my skin look more radiant after I used it for a few days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like that this creme was not too heavy for my older combination skin. It did seem to hydrate my skin well and worked well on both my face around my forehead and eyes and neck well. I trust RoC as I have used other products in the past and this one is one I would use in the future, also. I like that it was not too heavy or greasy and worked well under make-up, too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like using the daily hydration creme. My face feels so soft, I have notice a difference in my skin texture it is smoother and pores are reducing also. There is little to no scent, it is a light weight consistency. And it absorbs into the skin very fast. The RoC brand is one of the best and this has definitely made a difference with skin complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do see some of my fine wrinkles diminishing, but I'm still working on the troublesome larger wrinkles. The fine lines around my mouth and eyes are less noticeable. This product feels very good on the skin, it hydrates immediately and goes on smoothly. The smell is perfect, not overpowering. The packaging is attractive. I will continue to use the remainder of this product and would probably purchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This face product is incredibly amazing! I am still on my first week of application so I still need to see how it will resolve my age spot problem. On first application it is already noticeable how my skin is stretching and making my wrinkles and lines vaguer. It actually would take some effort now to make the wrinkles appear. It leaves my skin a healthy glow and my husband noticed how smoother it was. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Luv it! My face feels fresh, tight, shiny and look a lot younger than my age. It feels tingling when I put it on to my face, it works I can feel it. It works well if you put it on in the morning with your spf15 daily moisturizer. I could see my wrinkles reduce a little bit than before. This creme is awesome, I am for sure will use it all the time to make me look young and classy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product seemed to soften wrinkles on my forehead. I also noticed that it has lightened some of my age spots on the side of my face. It does have a scent. I prefer unscented, but it does go away. This cream has a rich texture although it isn't greasy on my skin. It didn't make me break out either. I will continue to use this because I feel like the results are only going to get better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this cream for over 2 weeks now and I already see a difference in my skin. It's a lot smoother, more plump and my skin just looks really good. I love how it's creamy but not greasy. I also love that it's oil free and non-Comedogenic. It has a beautiful nice scent and I defeated recommend it. Can't wait to see how my skin looks and feels after using it for a longer period. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The creme didn't really have a smell which was great. It went on smooth and soaked right in. It made my skin feel soft and the fine lines did look a lot better. I did not get any redness from the ingredients, which was good. I will continue using it as I think it did an excellent job. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Roc is not a lightweight, it is a moisturizer that goes in deep and your skin still feels hydrated hours later. Haven't used long enough to know if it does reduce wrinkles, but, as a moisturizer it's great. The directions suggest that you use a spf 15 sunscreen along with it.

I was given the product to test and review. I did not care for the RoC® RETINOL CORREXION® MAX Daily Hydration Crème. The product is quite thick and did not absorb into my skin well. It left my face feeling very greasy. The product is also heavily scented. I would not buy this product but I am glad I didn't spend money on trying it.

this stuff makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I have very dry skin. I only rated a four because I have only been using a week so not sure if I will see any wrinkle reduction or line smoothing.
it does seem to help put moisture back and help keep those wrinkles away
