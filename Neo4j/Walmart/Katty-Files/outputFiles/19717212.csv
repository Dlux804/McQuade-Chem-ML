"Excellent moisturizer for face and body, non-greasy and smells divine! I have tried a few of these moisturizers from St. Ives and they all work; but this Almond Linseed combo smells extremely nice. I use all their body washes as well as they too are beautifully scented. After discovering this line of products I no longer buy the high end ones."
I have been using this after my shower for years and suddenly it disappeared from store shelves but I found it online here. This lotion works quite well for me and it has a pleasant scent to it.
After a refreshing shower I look forward to completing my morning routine with a soothing body lotion. St. Ives's lotion with fantastic almond aroma is a perfect way to way to start my day.
"St Ives products never disappoint. This product has become a shelf staple for me and never leaves my bedside table. I use this when I wake up in the morning, post workout and post shower. I am able to keep my dry cracked winter skin looking smooth and refreshed now thanks to this product. I received this product from influenster.com for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Amazing for dry skin and combo skin I give it a 10
"Obviously St. Ives has changed their formulation on everything. I tried this though Collagen/Elastin has been my usual for many years, its effectiveness has been seriously weakened. Almond and Linseed was chosen as Collagen/Elastin's replacement because of its supposed ""24 hour deep restoring"" formula. Nope. The 3 star rating was actually generous. It's not average, it's quite a bit below average."
"I still have some lotion left from the previous formula and there is a great difference between the two. The new formula has a strong (and to me, unpleasant) smell. I cannot tolerate it. The new formula does not absorb as well as the previous one. It makes my hands slippery and does not help my chapped skin. I will not be buying more of it."
"I tried this because they changed the formula of my favorite vitamin e lotion. this stuff has a really strong perfume scent that gives me a headache. also, there is way too much glycerin in this. some glycerin is good for skin, but if you use too much, it can actually dehydrate. this stuff feels good when I put it on but I've noticed that in the long run, my hands are becoming dryer and dryer."
"I have been a happy customer of St. Ives for 15 years, but get disappointed when they change the products often. I am unable to use this new moisture because of the strong displeasing scent. Anyone have any ideas which I can use, unscented is what I need?"
"I totally love this lotion. I have been using it for several years. I love that when I put it on after my morning shower, I can still feel it on me when I take my evening bath. You can feel it coming off if you run your hands across your legs. It's hard to find this lotion where I live so I recently had to start using another lotion. My second choice is the St Ives Naturally Indulgent Coconut Milk and Orchid Extract. It smells heavenly."
I have been using this product for years. I have allergies to many others. Especially ones with scents. I am and out of the hospital often and I always get comments on how soft my skin feels. They always ask what I use. I use this every other day. I also like that once you apply it you don't feel coated or greasy. It has a very light feel. I especially like that it is not tested on animals. Best lotion ever!
"My husband put some of this on his hands and I could smell it 10 feet away! There is no reason to have such strong smelling lotion unless the company is trying to cover up a bad smell. I've always bought St. Ives for many years, but now I'm having to look for another lotion that doesn't smell so strong. Please, St. Ives, take note of all the comments about the overpowering fragrance!"
I been in desperate search of a body lotion that would help moisturize my dry skin. So I bought this and decided to give it a try. Not only does it last 24 hours but it also smells wonderful without a real strong smell. And it's super affordable! I will definitely continue using this lotion!
"I don't understand the negative reviews about this lotion. First of all, the scent is NOT overpowering; it is actually quite pleasant and fresh. Secondly, it is NOT slippery or greasy; it is actually fast absorbing. This one is my favorite out of all the St Ives body lotions. I am not a fan of all the other scents because I find the other ones a little too strong for me; but this one is just awesome. Do not pay attention to the negative reviews and buy this lotion. It works great on my dry skin. LOVE IT!"
"I love this lotion, it makes my skin so soft. Only been using for a few days. love that it doesn't have a strong scent. I will re-order."
One of the first lotions I have ever tried from St.Ives & it's honestly something I will buy until the end of time. The smell is absolutely amazing I've used it for about 2 years now.
Could not find my regular St. Ives lotion so tried this one. Smelled so bad i couldnt use it so i went back to the store and bought another St. Ives lotion. Disappointed to find that it also stinks. Please change this scent.
"The old 24 Hour was lightly textured and scented. The new one is heavy and smells awful, so after 7 years I have to again look for something that works for me."
I have extremely dry skin. This is the only lotion I've found that actually works. Could you put spf in it? In this day when we have to use it I dont understand why all the lotions don't have it already. 
"Helps keep my skin from drying out, and keeps it moist. I take a lot of medications and my skin would really dry out and be leathery without my St. Ives."
"Its been only two weeks of constant use and this lotion has really amazed me. My skin was drying out and I was becoming really self concious. Right now my skin is so moisturised! Skin tone is even from head to toe, and I feel amazing! HOLY GRAIL!"
I love this moisturizer! Its my favorite! I can see an amazing difference on my skin. I even sometimes use it on my face. And I really love that it doesn't have a scent all that much!
"ohh my Gosh i suffered from extreme itching in my arms, i tried everything nothing works. i saw St Ives 24 hour deep restoring body lotion, i said let me try it. the moment i tried it the itching went away and still working I LOVE IT. thank you"
"ST Ives Lotion is a very good value, its excellent product"
Used to be my favorite. Changed ingredients & now more water. Will not buy again.
"This lotion smells great,is not greasy and goes on quickly."
The best lotion ever used for brightening your skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have really dry skin and i used it right after i took a shower my body felt so fresh and smooth.. Love it, recommended to Any one that has dry skin"
Got this and it is absolutely amazing and yes 24 hour! I don't wake up to dry skin anymore even while I've gotten suntan. LOVE IT THANK YOU
This lotion works so good and it smells fantastic .
OMG the BEST!!! no more wrinkles ....I'm 55 yrs young now !!!
"The linseed oil has ruined a lotion that I have used and loved for years. Because of a gluten intolerance get rough, bumpy skin and the old formula kept the bumps at bay & my skin smooth for over 5 years. The linseed oil has thinned out the lotion and my hands are drying out. BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!"
"This lotion is perfect, except in the winter. My skin stays pretty moisturized for about 2 days if I don't shower(rarely) and well moisturized for the whole day when I do. Its better when used with a moisturizing body wash. Also its pretty cheap."
"I love St Ives and this is just another great product. I love the fact it is made with no parabens and instead uses natural ingredients. The best part is, the bottle lasts forever because the lotion is thick and concentrated. Love how it makes my skin feels!"
The only product that lets me control my curly hair without making it feel stiff & coated with gunk.
I use it more at night before going to bed. It really soaks into my skin and no oily residue. Love it!!
This is a very good product and I would suggest all to give it a chance!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Just bought this lotion, and applied all over my body. I must say this product had my skin so soft & smooth with a wonderful scent! My skin feels like baby skin all over again. Love it!!"
This is a good lotion. It gets the job done.
I like the smell but with my skin it is very hard for it to absorb. It leaves my hands very slick.
"st ives is the lotion for me, and this one is especially moisturizing."
I am in love with this body lotion. Leave your skin feeling hydrate and smooth.
I use this lotion daily to handle dry skin. And it never lets me down.
