Love this product!!!! My daughter uses it as well as she has sensitive skin and I have mature skin yet we both love it.
I have extremely dry sensitive skin. Washing with soap and water only irritates my face. I need a make-up remover and a cleanser all in one. This does the job beautifully without repeaded steps. Love the the way it leaves my skin moist and soft like no other product I have used. This is a keeper!
I love this product! I was looking for an excellent second cleanse product that kept my skin hydrated and I found it! It's gentle and didn't dry me out. Please don't stop making this!
"I love this product!!! I work at a dermatologist office and we highly suggest that our patient's . I just finished a bottle of the Hydro Boost gel and although it works just as well, I find the lotion cleanser to be more hydrating. I only tried the gel due to have oily skin however the lotion seems to suit me best. I will be purchasing this product going forward and will continue to tell my patient's to do the same."
My 10 year old son loves this face wash. It is gentle and effective. Washes away the days dirt without drying his face. We love Neutrogena products!
"Gentle, yet effective. Face is left feeling clean, supple, and hydrated. Neutrogena HydroBoost cleansing lotion is a lightweight gel, effective at removing makeup and leaving skin locked in with moisture, from hyaluronic acid. I would recommend this formula to those with acne prone and sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just used this and it took off barely any makeup I had to use it multiple times and now my skin is dry and burning and I don't have sensitive skin. Very disappointed. Doesn't do either of the things it says it does- moisturizes and removes makeup. Returning.
I bought it 3 weeks ago and doesn't take out my makeup. It's a hype
I have used this several times and each time it causes little pimples the next morning. No chance at this point it is anything other than this stuff. Really disappointing because I like it otherwise. The gel version of this didn't cause any problems but wanted to like the formula because of the extra moisturization.
"I love this product, I wish my local store carried it."
I really liked this product. I have very dry skin and so I am always looking for something that will keep my skin moisturized for several hours. I found that in this product.
"I have had this for a few weeks now, and I can say this is the best cleanser I have ever used for my sensitive skin. It is the first ""sensitive skin"" cleanser that doesn't sting the skin around my eyes, doesn't break out my skin, and leaves my skin feeling soft and conditioned, but completely clean. I just love it!"
"Oh, I love this facial cleanser! It is a very gentle, hydrating cleanser that is perfect for my dry, sensitive skin. I absolutely love that it is fragrance-free because I can only use fragrance-free products on my skin. I would give this a 10-star rating!"
"This is a mild, fragrance free formula that feels like it melts onto skin to instantly remove traces of dirt, oil and makeup without greasy residue. It has hyaluronic acid which is a formula which increases skin's hydration level and lock it in and leaving"
"skin clean, soft and touchably soff and smooth every time you use it."
This cleanser is very gentle and perfect for sensitive skin. This left my face soft and feeling like there was no traces of dirt and oil left behind. This didn't remove my mascara so I recommend eye makeup remover before using this. Overall this is a product
that will stay a part of my facial routine for a while.
"I bought and used this product when I first saw it on the shelfs, now I use it all the time! I wish the price point was a bit lower but it's a great drugstore luxury. I loved the texture of the mosturizer. It was a light gel so it felt like something that"
would really moisturize my skin AND IT DID. I found that this was perfect to use at night and to wear under my make up. I now use this product every day.
"I love the Neutrogena brand, so I was really excited to test out a new product! Overall, I liked it quite a lot. I used it primarily in the shower as part of my nighttime routine. I liked most how non-drying it was, as I don't usually like to moisturize at night due to tiredness and wanting to avoid acne. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wow I am impressed with this cleansing lotion. It did a good job cleaning away all the makeup at the end of the day, still needed to use some makeup remover to get the rest but it did get most of it and it left my face feeling clean and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the clean feeling neutrogen Lotion has brought to my face! It removes the unwanted dirt but at the same time makes my face soft! This lotion feels nice and smooth on my face. It is not soapy at all. I highly recommend this product with people with sensitive skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've only used it twice, and sometimes i have to use something several times before i know whether it's going to work well or tear my face up, but so far it seems to be working well. It's not overly drying or making my eczema act up yet, so we'll see how it goes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Strips moisture. Intensly strips moisture. Has to be the corn starch.
I have oily and sensitive skin and this leaves my skin feeling clean without irritation.
"I received a free sample of this product, and let me tell you what!!! I fell I love instantly!! My face never felt or looked so alive!"
OMG... the first time I actually used this cleanser it was amazing it left my skin so soft and it felt refreshing I have tried so many of their products and this one does not compare:)
This is a gentle cleanser which doesn't sting or dry my skin out unlike most cleansers. The gentle type of this is fragrance free which is a plus for me. I love this line. I'm getting ready to start on my second bottle. Is worth your try.
I love Neutrogena Hydro-Boost Gentle Cleasing Lotionvits great for my dry skin and I am not break out as bad keeping face clean and makeup light means less beakouts.
I love this cleansing lotion because it is mild and fragrance free. It removes my makeup and leaves my skin moisturized and fresh feeling. I would highly recommend you try Neutrogena Hydro Boost Gentle Cleansing Lotion because it works!
Very gentle on my skin and I'm Oily/Dry/Normal depending on the weather.This cleanser cleans without stripping. Foams but not over foamy. I love it! My face feels super clean afterward! I use it with my Clarisonic and absolutely love it!
This feels like you're applying lotion but it's removing all the ickyness off your face. It's non-dryinf formula feels amazing and leaves your face feeling a deep down clean like a facial . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I was not able to sample this, However, I have purchased this in the winter months because my skin became very dry from Eczema. It works very well on my skin and I love it alot! However, in the summer I stopped using it because my skin became oily and"
I live in a very humid climate.
I found this product to be so so. Cleans your face but doesn't get deep down pore dirt. I wasn't real impressed with this product considering I've used other products from this company that I still buy and use regularly but this will not be one of them.
The product price I found to be very reasonable even a bit lower then some other brands. I do have to say it does keep to its word on being very gentle on the skin.
"It is a good cleansing, you can definitely see and feel the difference after using it, the skin is softer and it feels cleaner, the only thing I could say is that I would only use it once a week since it breaks me out using every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I like that it's gentle and soft on the skin.

The NeutrogenaÂ® Hydro Boost Gentle Cleansing Lotion is very lightly scented. It has a smooth consistency like a lotion. It goes on smoothly on the skin. It doesn't foam but effectively cleanses the skin. I appreciate that it didn't dry up my skin but helped retain moisture. I would recommend this facial cleanser to all skin types because it cleanses well but helps keep moisture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It is light and cleans the skin nicely. I used it during my shower and after I didn't feel my skin dry as usual. It complements nicely with neutrogena hydro boost multi vitamin gel. My skin never felt so hydrated and moisturized. I love both products together. Definetely this new line is the best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have sensitive skin and this didn't bother me at all. It didn't leave my face feeling tight like some other face washes I've used either. Overall, wonderful product.

This cleans fairly well it has a moisturizing content so my skin is not overly dry and has a pleasant scent although sometimes my skin does dry out a bit especially in the winter would be nice if it was a little bit more moisturizing but I think for the average person that would be great [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this cleansing lotion. My face is very sensitive and turns red from just washing it so I have to be choosy with facial care.
