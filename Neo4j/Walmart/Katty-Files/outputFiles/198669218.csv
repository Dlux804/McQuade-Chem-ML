I have sensitive skin. I also have a very oily nose which seems hard to remove the oil from my pores. I used this and I think it works great. My face feels smooth and noticed less oil build up on my nose.
Olay Regenerist Detoxyfying Pore Scrub Cleanser works great! It dimished the appearance of my pores and left my face feeling fresh and smooth. It doesn't have a rough texture. I highly recommend this face scrub cleanser!
I have loved ALL Olay products since I was 16. They just keep getting better and better. I have pores and oily skin. This cleanser is so gentle I use it everyday. You are truly able to see a difference after a couple of days in the change in your pores.
I alternate between this and the clarins orange cleanser which is so expensive. this olay cleanser is the only one of its kind that can be purchased at my local drug and dedicated to the Regenerist line for aging skin. My face does not feel clean unless I scrub and I need a scrub that will not dry out my skin. This product is great. My skin feels real clean and not dried out.
"This was a wonderful product I now see a diffrent in skin made skin soft, smooth, the scent wasnt my favorite but as for the product itself will repurches. My skin now is better with acne and less break out now hopfully I will see a big difference after using 60 day will return to let anyone who intrested my real honest review!!! Thanks walmart and olay ☺☺☺"
"I wasn't a big fan of this cleanser. I generally like anything that cleanses my skin while focusing on my pores (because I do struggle with larger pores around my nose), but this just didn't do anything for me. I didn't feel all that clean after using it, the smell was ""eh"", and the the scrub didn't feel quite like a scrub. I would recommend if those three things I mentioned don't exactly matter to you, but if any of those things matter to you, I wouldn't waste your money on this one. There are better products out there."
Leaves face feeling dirty after using. Doesnât remove makeup at all. When I went to apply my toner the cotton pad came out way dirtier than when I use Avedaâs similar cleanser or even Nutregena. I also had to use makeup remover. This is probably the worst face cleanser Iâve ever bought.
"I used Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub for 10+ yrs. Had I reviewed it before the new look I would have given it 5 stars. Bought it to reduce my pores. Not only did it work, it also got rid of my adult acne and made my skin feel softer. Now the ""NEW LOOK"" product is completely different. I counted 9 ingredients that are no longer in the cleanser. It cleans my face, but none of the extra benefits. I'm breaking out again and my skin isn't as soft. PLEASE return to the old version!"
"I love this product to bits, it helps my skin a lot and doesn't let it breakout or go red! It is extremely effective and I definitely recommend it for people with dry skin and I used it and then used a moisturiser after and it removed most of my dry skin and left it really soft! But I noticed a difference over a period of 3-4 weeks!"
"i used the old Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Cleanser, 5.0 Fluid Ounce and loved it! Bought the new LOOK and figured it would work the same. IT Docent. ;( it rough & not smooth and does not Smell No Were Near as Fresh. Very Disappointed . Now I must find Another Product... ;("
"This stays stocked in my bathroom and goes with me when I travel. I like to use this in the summer and maybe once a week the rest of the year. I also use it prior to using self tanner to help exfoliate my skin to make the tan apply more evenly. It has a lovely light fragrance and is gentle on the skin. This is a lot less harsh than the St. Ives Apricot Scrub if you're looking for something lighter. The price is budget friendly, too!"
"I turned to this product after Olay discontinued its Thermal Skin Polisher (and I'm still upset about it I might add); so this review may be biased. However, this product does the job as far as cleaning my skin and doing a light exfoliation but it's not one of Olay's best.m; I rate it average at best. It's not expensive so you get what you pay for. I'm still waiting patiently for Olay to hear my pleads for them to bring back the Thermal Skin Polisher."
"This product is ok. It does work, but I was disappointed. I'm not a fan of olay too much, and that's because it's very odd I do not have a reaction to their products and I feel fragrance is the culprit. If you're looking for something non abrasive and dont have an issue to fragrance you might enjoy this product. Due to the sensitivity to fragrance I would not repurchase."
It's okay I guess. It doesn't have a resounding 5 out of 5 for me simply because it left my face lacking I guess. It's just your average cleanser and it's okay I mean I really can't say nothing else ever then it's okay and if you want to try it you can try it I don't know
This is my daily go to cleanser. It is gentle on the skin but tough on face dirt. I use it after I remove my makeup to ensure that my pores are clean and face ready for bed. I have been using this for the past 4 years with no issue. Olay could improve on packaging (as it rubs off after a while) but other than that the product is great and worth the price.
Olay has come up with a scrub that is definitely gentle enough to use everyday while cleaning the face. I keep this in my shower to make sure all of the makeup gets off. I do uses liquid eye makeup remover with a cotton ball before washing my face. Olay products leave my skin feeling perfectly clean without drying.
I I actually really like this product because before I had tried it I didnt think it would work well on my skin but after trying it I was amazed and fell love with it. My sister is the one who recommended this product for me and I really am thankful for that because this cleanser is great!
It was more affordable here than at the Olay online store. I have been using this product for years for beautiful ageless skin.
"I really love this product. As I am older, I need a cleanser that is not too harsh and this cleanser is amazing but...The tube starts to crack & peel and leaves specks of paint on your hands. Very frustrating!"
"I liked this product except that it leaves tiny white specks of product on your face - very frustrating! I thought at 1st it was the tube flaking, so I covered it with tape, but it's the actual product. I won't repurchase 'cuz of this!"
"This cleanser left my skin noticeably brighter the first time I used it. My skin is oily still at age 54, and this cleanser made it a bit dry. Overall I am happy with how it leaves my skin, and I just use a moisturizer for oily skin to finish."
"While I love using this cleanser, I hate it when I get to about 25% left, because the paint on the tube begins to crack off as I try to squeeze the remaining product for use."
"This product was very good at removing makeup. It felt pretty nice, had a pleasant smell and lasted a long time. I didnt see any real change in my skin and it was a little drying at times. I didnt repurchase."
This was a super good face cleanser compared to some of the ones Ive tried. This helped making my pores smaller and reducing red spots and acne around my face
Washing my face with this I get amazing fresh feeling and I feel so good after using this product I love this product in love with this I also recommend to my friends all the time !!
Good face wash. Left my skin feeling clean. I dont have sensitive skin but it didnt feel harsh. It didnt clear my acne but its a good face wash if you dont have bad acne.
"I found this to be an okay scrub. It is more gentle than I presonally prefer, but get the job done and is good for those who have trouble with more abrasive scrubs. It helped remove my makeup and leave my face fresh at night, so it is gentle enough for daily use. Would buy again."
"Not only is this cleansing scrub okay to use daily, it is cost effective and leaves your skin feeling incredibly soft. I use it every day and started using it because I had a sever break out from another skin care product I used. This helped and left my skin felling incredible."
This is a very finely milled physical skin exfoliant that works very well at keeping your skin nice and smooth. It is gentle enough to use daily as it takes off all of the superficial dry skin you didn't even know you had. It has a pleasant scent and it's very cost efficient. I highly recommend it.
Good price and pretty good results. You just need a small nickle size amount to rub in gently but thoroughly. Takes about a week to notice but it does the job on typical skin. Severe blackheads I'd use the garnier blackhead remover. But if you've got somewhat normal skin it does s great job with pores.
"This just okay to me. It's decent for a drugstore brand as it's not overly abrasive, yet still does something as opposed to other scrubs I've tried that just felt like a cleanser. It's a bit pricey for a drug store brand in my opinion but it's definitely not the most pricey option there is."
"I used the regenerist line from olay and loved EVERY product, the pore scrub cleanser was one of my favorites because it smells amazing, cleans deep down into my skin and the gentle exfoliation preps your skin to absorb the moisturizer (next step in the regenerist regimen). It's on the pricier side but lasts a while as a little goes a long way!"
I love the smell and feel of this scrub cleanser. It makes my face feel clean and like I'm taking care of my skin. The packaging is easy to read and spot on the shelf. This product exceeds my expectations and I would definitely buy this product again.
"i like this scrubby cleanser because it works well on dry skin without stripping away any natural oils. i would recommend this to others.,,it smells super good and the packaging is really cute. I would buy it again, especialaly if i was giving it to a friend with dry skin"
"I really this pore scrub! It smells nice, has a perfect price point and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and smooth without being too harsh. I love all the new olay products and I have been using a name brand face wash for the last couple years and this is just as good for a quarter of the price. Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Cleanser"
My husband told me that i should buy this along with the Olay Pro-X Advanced Cleansing System 0.68 Fl Oz and am glad that i did. it's so easy to use. works great the first time i used it i could tell my face was softer & looked younger. It works great & it's not only for woman men can use it as well. I do not have any problems with my face as far as zip or oiliness but this product works for me anyways. it's great.
Olay Detoxifying pore scrub cleanser leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh and it certainly did meet my expectations! It was gentle! And it sloughed the dry skin off . I am a first time user for this certain brand. The fragrance was a little strong but not bad though!
Makes my skin feel good and fresh would definitely recommend and buy again. The packaging is pretty and well made. I say the price is exactly where it should be not to much not to little. The product is soft on my skin and doesn't make it feel tight or drag.
"From the first use to the end of the tube I loved this cleanser. It's fresh scent, smoothing texture and cleansing ingredients not only made me feel fresh and clean but also made my skin look younger! The price point just makes it that much easier to recommend for everyone!"
"I used this for about 6 months and really liked it. Its gel based and has medium exfoliant in it. It seemed to remove makeup really well, and truly clear pores and reduce acne. The problem was ,it was too drying for me to use more than once a day, and I like to wash twice a day. Try it."
"This was a life saver for my skin. Honestly! My pores were so clean after this. It's a good price because man let me tell you it does the job! I use this about 5 days of the week and never fails. I think this product really works well on me because I have oily skin, which means pores = dirt, but this product saves the day!"
"As my skin is very dry, I worry about products stripping down my natural oils. This product doesn't leave the skin dry and helps get down into the pores. I haven't noticed a major difference on my face but it is a nice product to have around. It's a gentle product that scrubs right off."

This scrub leaves my face feeling very smooth and soft as well as cleaning my pores. I use nightly and can tell a difference in the overall look and feel of my skin. Great price too"
"100% hands down the only facial soap i have used in probably 4 years. The microbeads arent so harsh against your skin that when you rinse, your face doesnt look raw and burned, but they are powerdful enougj to even your skin tone dramatically, leave your skin feeling soothed and rejuvinated (shiny but not oily shiny). I have good skin to begin with and this is the only ""facial/skin product "" i use"
Oil of Olay is one of my favorite brands! Its a classic that has been around forever for a reason. It's an affordable product that is as effective as the high end products. It has many different varieties for every age. It's worth it and highly recommended.
"This is one of my all time fav facial exfoliating cleansers. Recently I have been working on two others that came in a sub box but I always find myself coming back to Olay. The packaging is nice, the price is really good and the results are fantastic. I have combo skin and this is just what my skin needs at the end of a long day."
"Has really helped refine my skin texture, but skin still has some roughness after scrubbing. Would recommend adding a few more sugar or whatever they utilize for the dermabrasion. Other than that I really like it.Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Cleanser"
"I've used this facial wash for a long time, and I'll continue to use it. I love it!"
"Makes my face feel cleaner ,smoother and mild to use"
Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"You can see results right away! I had the hardest time finding something to help with black heads, and this works great!!"
"Works very well as a gentle exfoliating scrub. I use about once a week for a new, fresh, skincare regime."
"Love, love love this product! Gentle enough on your skin, yet effective enough to remove dead skin and leave your face feeling smooth."
I have large pores and this product is great! It deep cleans my face while getting everything out of my pores and leaves my face feeling fresh and smooth.
I like this product quite a bit it is a very good nightly face wash and if you wear makeup everyday I would say this would be a great product for you. It is a great price and it works amazing.
Great product to use over the counter if you're in a pinch and can't find your typical face wash. I also felt like it could have been a little bit stronger in the cleansing area.
"This product is a great cleanser, it refreshes skin and reduces pores drastically. Its reasonably priced and a great value. I love the scent also, and your face will stay looking and feeling refreshed all day!"
This cleanser is a solid. I keep this in the bathroom always just in case I run out of whatever else I am using at the moment. It does go on pretty harsh so do not scrub roughly. The scent is also nice.

I only use this a couple of times a month. When makeup seems to build up in pores I use this scrub to clean pores. Kinda pricey but a little goes a long way.
This product was really nice but not right for me. This scrub was a bit too much for my sensitive skin. I would recommend this product to people with less sensitive skin.
I received a very small sample of this from Olay so my review is just of my one time use of product. I really liked the smell of it and my skin was super soft after using.
I use this stuff every day. My face looks and feels great. I highly recommend this product especially if your like me and it's hard to find products that you can use on your face. Its affordable and you can pretty much buy it anywhere.
This really cleans out my pores though I don't know if I should be proud that I don't see that many pores or that my pores that cleaned out more often that I see the texture more
I love trying pore scrubs because i have fairly large pores and this one do not disappoint. My skin is a bit senstitive so using it too much can be harsh on my skin but i love the results after using this product.
I love this stuff I have very oily Acne prone skin and I feel this really helped reduce the amount of breakouts I had. It foams up just a bit and isn't super harsh
"Really good for your face after a make up day , like it cleans up the whole make up from your face. You would be surprise by the result. Of course I was surprise and shocked by the result. That's why I recommend this to you"
LOVE IT !!! It's detoxifying alright ! Wow my face felt brand freaking new the first time I used this. I need something that works but isn't too harsh and they absolutely nailed it
I really appreciate this cleanser that goes into each pore and scrubs away my impurities. This cleanser left my face without any trace of makeup and definitely did it's job to leave me feeling fresh.
"I love this facial cleanser! It leaves my skin soft and of course has me looking 10 yrs younger, I've been using it for a year and nothing else has come close to comparing. The smell is almost nonexistent! Remember a little goes a long way"
This is really really good. i love to wear makeup almost everyday and after a while my face feels dull rough and I can always trust this to give my face a pick me up. And it makes my face feel so clean. And i love it.
I have tried this and actually it did work I would eat a lot of tomatoes and acid fruits and vegetables in the summer and I must say it did help for me getting blemishes

"Love the texture of this product and how it cleans my skin, I like the packing it had good colour. I will be buying this again it was effective for me and my skin, it is a good value."
"Didn't see much of a difference in pore. Nice texture but overall, it wasn't anything spectacular. I still like the st Ives better...much better result than the Olay detoxifying pore scrub cleanser."
"Love this product! My go to cleanser for every day skincare. Keeps my skin clean and refreshed, not too dry but not too oily. I know when I don't use this every day, my skin is VERY oily so it's something I always have on hand."
I love this Olay Regenerist detoxifier scrub. I've been using it for about a week and I have noticed a difference and redness. I highly recommend using this with the Regenerist serum at night. Olay Regenerist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Cleanser
"This stuff is a good exfoliating scrub but not too harsh. Leaves my skin smooth and smells so good! It didn't shrink my pores like I had hoped, but it does keep me from getting blackheads, so it's at least working!"
This is amazing for the popes i love how its smooth on the face it can deep clean your face its really effective most definitely helps it has a really nice color and form i would recommend to everybody to buy this product
I use this as part of my nightly skin routine. It was recommended to me and I love using it. It really makes me skin feel refreshed and clean after using it. It met my expectations fully. It's a gentle scrub with no harsh after effects!
While I wouldn't say this product is bad. I haven't noticed a difference in my skin. I was hoping for more of a change in blackheads. I will not purchase again

Love this cleanser! I rotate this product with my other cleansers as I use it more as an exfoliant! Leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshing! Reasonably priced and high quality product. Highly recommend!
Olay is one of the best skincare brands on the market. I love how my skin feels after using their stuff. I love their collab with Covergirl. This pore scrub is the best. Your skin will be flawless and feel brand new with it.
My face is super dry. I have red spots aw well. I am a first time user. Some stuff is pricey but the more expensive the better it is. The packaging is wrapped well. I would buy again for myself. Great stuff
This is a pretty good Pore Scrub. Slightly pricey but you get what you pay for. It leaves your face with a soft silky feeling instead of all dried out. so I would say it was definitely effective!
I enjoy this product because it was an effective scrub without being too harsh for my skin sensitive skin. My skin is also dry so I this kept it hydrated while keeping my face feeling clean
"Amazing daily exfoliant! A little dab in your hand goes a long way and it leaves my face with a clean I can feel! No clogged pores! Affordable cost, best bought in store."
"Super easy to use and takes off your days makeup in a swipe. With a face wipe or makeup remover right after, will help take your whole day makeup. Good value for the price"
I really like this pore scrubbing detoxifying cleanser! The small beads make my face feel like new! It energizes my skin and makes it feel great afterwards! I really inexpensive cleanser for good results
This is my favorite face wash ever! It leaves my face feeling clean and Smooth. It does not leave a dull film that some face washes tend to leave. I recommend this to everyone that asks. It makes my face feel fresh and cleans off makeup wonderfully.
Using it daily for years helps my skin stay moist. Nonexspensive . Gentle foe every day use. I have used this product through out my years . Have tried others but always come back to play it works the best.
It is a really good face scrub. I've used this for bout 3 months and saw great improvement. I definitely recommend and plus it's not expensive. It does just exactly what it say it does.
"This is amazing. I use it every morning with my clarisonic and my face feels amazing. So fresh, clean, and so smooth! The scent is neutral and it's gentle on your skin!"
"I had such high hopes! This product is drying my skin out and seems to be making my pores and fine lines more noticeable. I have liked Olay in the pasr, but I am still in need of a decent cleanser."
Excellent product
Very effective facial scrub minimizing pores without being irritating.
Does ok I guess I'm not seeing a difference to be honest.
I love scrub pore cleaning by Olay will by when on sale get the face good and feeling good
I love this cleanser! It does the job and makes my face feel happy! Its very effective and considerably priced.
deserved to have a 5 star from me. This product help me detoxify my super big pores just kidding. but i have a lot of it back then .
This scrub feels soo nice on the skin. I really feel when I use this scrub that my skin is being cleaned of dead skin and impurities.
I tried Ay Regenetist Detoxifying Pore Scrub Cleaner. I really did not like this product I could not see a change in my skin.
My all time favorite facial scrub. Leaves my skin smooth and soft. This product isn't too harsh and causes no irritation.
"Tried this scrub it works pretty good. Like srcub sand in it, is not to abrasive. It doesn't not leave dry skin."
Worked amazing love the way it made my skin look. Very refreshing and amazingly clean little exspensive but worth every penny my new favorite product
great pore scrub! a little goes a long way and very reasonably priced. minimizes pores & makes face look incredibly fresh.
I use this scrub occasionally to exfoliate my skin. It is both creamy and grainy. Takes a while to rinse off but leave my face feeling clean.
Leaves my skin feeling soft! I use it on the days I don't use my Clarisonic and it seems to be working well for my skin.
Great product!! Awesome quality!! Works well!! Price wise is worth the money!! I definitely would recommend this product
I love this it smells good an makes my skin so soft after using. I've repurchased this twice already.
Okay products are just really good. They have the nicest scents and this scrub I only used like three times made a difference.
While this is not cruelty free but I got this before I was aware of that stuff. Thiddoesa good job as a scrubber.
This is a good product just need to not use it during the summer because it leaves my face dry. But I love it in the winter !
Good product very creamy. Would not use if you have dry skin but I would use with an exfoliating brush. Smells odd.
Works great for getting that deep down dirt in your pores. Every time I use this face cleanser I feel so refreshed and clean.
"I have try skin that's prone to breaking out, especially if I don't exfoliate. This is wonderful and my skin feels clean and smooth after using it."
I love this product. It really does help my face. I'm a really picky person when it comes for products that go on my face.
I love this product very much.I have seen a big difference in my skin since using this product.I will definitely be buying this all the time.
"I love using this product,my face feels clean and I love the packaging, my face is smooth when I used it is very effective."
Gentle enough for my extremely sensitive skin. Have purchased this time and time again becuase I finally found something that works!
I love it my skin has never been this smooth my makeup goes on perfectly and my Pores are clearer than they used to be
"Didn't love the scent, left a film on my skin. I rinsed several times. It was also a little too grainy."
"Daily facial cleanser, you will love it when it minimizes your pores. Recommend to be used daily, a little pricey but love it"
This product really makes a big difference because before I started using this my pores were really clogged and it wasn't very noticeable.
I didn't really like the product as I didn't feel that the scrub was a powerful one. It was also very expensive without a coupon.
I love this product for these reasons below: How it leaves the skin feeling Soothing nature I WOULD USE AGAIN!
LOVE this! Really cleaned out my pores and my face always feels so fresh and clean after using it. It doesnt dry out or irritate my skin either
"This is just an average cleanser. It did a fine job cleansing, but it was nothing life changing. Good for the price."
This product works alright. It makes your face soft after each use. Can be a little costly but worth it.
Great product and great quality. I would definitely recommend this to other people. I dont feel it toxifys as much though
"I really like this scrub, it makes your face super super soft and it did not break me out as much as I thought so it's a thumbs up from me!"
"Not my favorite scrub, the beads don't have enough texture for my liking. I'm a fan of St. Ives apricot scrub, though, which is super textured."
It has a decent smell and just give your face a good scrub and you get a decent product for the price
Leaves your skin soft and smelling great!! Great for breakouts. For the best results make sure you use it with a facial scrubbing brush.
"Love this product, really gets down in my pores and cleans them out, leaving my face fresh and detoxified!"
I liked the feel of this product on my skin but my face didnt feel clean after I rinsed it. It felt more like lotion
I have black heads mainly in the t zone of my face and this face wash is my go to for daily washing to keep my face clear.
"this cleanser works wonders! for being such an average one as far as being able to get it anywhere, it works great and cleans my skin and pores"
I like the product. I do not use oils that much due to the fact I have acne prone skin. This product does not make me breakout.
I had never used this before but i was very happy with the product! Good value and i will be buying this again
"Your skin feels so clean after this! It really clears out your pores and does it's job, it isn't too pricey either!"
This did really well for my skin. I use it every night and every morning. I like the way my makeup goes on after washing face with this.
I just finished my second sample . It's amazing . My skin looks fresh and clean after I use it . I have to buy a new one .
I really@enjoy this product when I exfoliate. It's not to rough and dosnt leave skin feeling over scrubbed
Leaves face very smooth and clear looking. Very small and gentle beads so on the smooth exfoliation side
"This item looked used when it arrived to my house. There was no sealer on the opening to peel off. The tube felt somewhat empty to me. And there was dried ""crud"" around the opening. I've just begun to use Walmart for ordering and shipping items to my home, and from what I've seen with this product and another, I'm not too thrilled. Back to amazon I go."
Good price and pretty good results. You just need a small nickle size amount to rub in gently but thoroughly. Takes about a week to notice but it does the job on typical skin. Severe blackheads I'd use the garnier blackhead remover. But if you've got somewhat normal skin it does s great job with pores.
Love the product. Best cleanser ever that I use on a daily basis to thoroughly cleanse my skin daily. However the last 3 of these that I've purchased have terrible packaging! The outside flakes off all the way down to the white tube leaving metallic flakes all over my hands. Somethings changed and it's terrible!
I am a big fan of this line in general. The products feel good on your skin. This is a nice scrub that is not too harsh and doesn't leave my skin feeling overly sensitive. It is also good at keeping my skin feel rejuvinated and youthful. This is a great product.
"This product is not as ""scrubby"" as I'd like it to be. I have oily skin and I don't feel it is strong enough to cut through the oil. I didn't really see an anti-aging effect at all. While it is affordably priced and easily accessible it just wasn't for me."
"Love the product,however, noticed that after a couple of weeks half of the writing/ pictures on the tube is cracking off leaving the tube just white. Is this something that is dangerous or harmful? I have not seen this with any other skin care product container that I have purchased. Just switched from Aveeno. So yes the product is great, the container not so much."
"I have huge pores that have always been an embarrassment! This is the BEST product I have found over the years to reduce size to basically nil and remove all blackness from my pores. It's my miracle cleanser! I also have sensitive skin but surprisingly have no issues using this ""scrub"" 2x per day. My skin looks great with this cleanser! Combined with Olay moisturizer, people guess my age around 30 (rather than almost 40) with compliments to my fantastic skin. I tell them it's Olay!"
"I'm 69 and got introduced to Olay at the tender age of 10, when a grand aunt gave me my first 4 oz. glass bottle of Olay Beauty Fluid as it was called back then. I've never used anything on my face but Olay products. I have very few wrinkles for my age as well. Will always use Olay products til the day I die."
I use this every day. Twice per day as it is that gentle. My pores always look so refined and I feel like I have prepared my skin for my day or my night ahead. It has helped me keep blackheads away and I feel like I am a winner for once in the battle for my face. Love it.
"I have rosacea so it's very hard to find a product that doesn't cause a flare up or burns. This particular formula from Olay works for me! The first time I used it, I could feel the exfoliators doing their job. My face feels great after using it. I definitely would recommend! A+..5 stars all the way around!"
"I have been using several different Olay products since I was a child over the years. They all seem to work really well and do what they promise. This is no exception. I used this in the morning and it not only detoxifies, but it gives my skin that dewy glow that I like. Wonderful products, especially for the price!!! I am writing this review to enter into a contest. However, every word is true. A refreshed face for about $6!!! Cannot beat that."
This scrub is very gentle on the skin yet can be used everyday to help exfoliate your skin. Most exfoliators are harsh and leave redness and irritation with daily use. This one leaves the skin feeing soft and smooth and moisturized. It travels with me to work- I never leave home without my Olay face wash! @influenster #contest #olayatwalmart
"This pore scrubber is wonderful! It is much less scratchy than I imagined while having a very toning effect. With a name like pore scrubber, I was expecting something more like an apricot scrub or sugar scrub. This is nothing like that. This has a little grainy effect but is mostly smooth. However, it still tones! I find it no more harsh and that Regenerating Cream Cleanser. Actually, I think this is gentler to use though it does tone better."
"Normally I use the sensitive formula, however I grabbed this product on accident and love it! It is not too aggressive and helps with oil control through out the day. Also, leaves an all over clean feeling to my skin without much product needed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the foaming cleanser for years now and I still love it to this day. I can always tell when I switch to another cleanser (even Olay products) the combination/oily works perfect for my skin type and of course I always use my moisturizing face lotion after every wash! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Tingling and warm feeling really Great product. My skin feels great after. Good price point.
What can you say it is oil of Olay. So you know it is good. Continue to use it and see results.
Smells really good. Makes your face feel relaxing super gentle definitely worth the price
I love detoxifying masks and also it's a scrub. Very affordable and helps with pore related issues
Love this stuff!! It's inexpensive and makes my face feel great. I've been using it for years!!!
Great for a morning or before bed cleanser. Leaves skin soft and firm. Love the little beads
Love this ! It cleanses my skin and leaves it smooth and hydrated . Its soft and smells wonderful .
You get what you pay for with this product. It definitely did the job but I've used better cleansers. It came in nice packaging and it was my first time using it. I would consider buying it again in the future!
Seems ok but nothing to write home about. I can't see much of a difference in my skin when using this product. Probably will continue using apricot scrub as this cleanser isn't doing much to impress me.
This face wash leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh every night. This is the first time I've used this specific Olay product but I am very happy with it
"I like Olay products, however, this cleanser left my face feeling dry and tight afterwards. It was somewhat disappointing as I like Olay. It was a bit too harsh for me. I would like it better if it moisturized more."
A good detoxifying pore scrub cleanses deep down in the pores. This skin care product does just that. I highly recommend to friends and family. I would purchse this again.
"Olay is my FAVORITE brand for skin care by far. I began using it because it's what my mom always used, but it quickly became apart of my daily routine! I use this before i go to bed before i put on my olay moisturizer!"
This face product is great. It leaves my face feeling so fresh and cleansed. My pores aren't clogged and I don't get breakouts! 10/10 recommendation to family and friends!
"My mom had this in her bathroom and i figured what the heck I might as well tried it. It was nice on my skin, wasn't to harsh. It was my favorite but it did the trick for sure!"
Love this product it works great and make your skin feel amazing afterwards. It was everything I was needing and gentle. Pricing is amazing as well. And the packaging is perfect I would recommend.
"I have searched for years for an affordable and effective pore scrub and finally over a month ago I discovered this product. It's gentle on the skin, smells great and results are noticeable immediately. Try It. You won't be disappointed."
The texture is light. Smells amazing. Helped my skin all throughout the day. Keeps skin feeling soft. Helped get rid of breakouts. I'd definitely recommend this to friends and family.
Olay has been a family favorite brand for generations. Olay regenerist detoxifying pore scrub cleanser gently exfoliates my skin and cleanses it without drying it out. My skin feels gentle and smooth.
"Olay regenerist detoxifying pore scrub cleanser, it works good for me. I have sensitive skin and I like the soft sensation that it lets on my face. It really clean the pores! #contest #oleyatwalmart @influenster"
"This product smells great. My skin did not feel rough afterwards, it was actually smooth. I would definitely buy it again. #influentser #virtualvox #walmart"
I just my love my Olay Oil Minimizing Clean Foaming Cleanser- Combination . It makes my skin feel so soft and clean. Friends always want to know what product I use on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for years and it works wonderfully and doesn't dry out my skin. I would recommend it to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this stuff! It's highly concentrated and you only need a tiny bit! It foams up nicely and your skin feels great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i like this scrub to use. i don't use it too often because it does say to use once or twice a week and i feel super clean after every use. i like it the smell isn't too bad, or there isn't too much ""beads"" in the bottle where your skin will irritate because my skin is sensitive but i enjoy this for that reason. this is my favorite scrub."
Such a great deep cleansing of the face. Great price. Great product. Best after feel ever and I absolutely LOVE this product !!!!
I've tried a lot of different face washes and this one actually made my skin look better instead of worse it scrubs and makes it look bright
"I loved this in my teens . This was a life saver and I'm even thinking if going back . It cleared my skin, moisturized and exfoliated all in one."
This not only smells and feels great but also reduces the lines ansd wrinkles that happen with natural age. I highly recommend this
This stuff is absoutly amazing. It makes your face feel super clean and clear. Its easy ti apply and take off and snells amazing
I normally use a facial scrub for a bit and will switch off. But this product I literally used all of. love love love!
This cleanser moisturize my face while exfoliating. I love the scent ! and that is gentle on the skin. I would rate this product like 10!
its awesome i love it. it worked on my face in one week. blackheads pimples acne all gone in one week for my face. clenses perfectly
"This is decent cleanser, I prefer others but this one is great as well, give it a chance. My skin didn't hate it at least lol"
Actually I used this product from Olay for three weeks and it was nice ... When I wash my face I feel so clean ...
I love the beads in it. It exfoliates my face during wash leaving my face nice and smooth as well as clean.
This is great for daily use. Gentle enough to use twice a day. I notice the difference in my pores every time I wash my face. My skin type is oily.
"I have tried everything.. And everything expensive. This is really nice. Made a beautiful difference. Relieved, and very pleased.. Thank you."
I absolutely love this stuff. It's rich and concentrated. It's definitely a must have in your facial regime.

I'm a huge believer in olay I've been using it for 25 years now and I will not use anything else

This is a pretty good cleanser if you have oily skin
