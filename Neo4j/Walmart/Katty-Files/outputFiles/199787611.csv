"I am in my 60's and this is the best moisturizer I have ever used. I expect to change moisturizers as I age and need more help for wrinkles and dry skin, but the first time I purchased Ultimate Miracle Worker, I was shocked at the difference it made in my skin. I would never be without it. I also appreciate that it does not have an offensive odor like some moisturizers for older women. It also does not feel greasy. Other products I use are Ultimate Miracle Worker Night, Purity, and Miracle worker makeup."
"I used to use the original miracle worker, and liked it very much, I love the newer version just as much, it goes on like silk and leaves your skin feeling smooth and looking refreshed, I love the sun even tho we all know the warnings, this product helps reduce the effects of sun exposure . There really isn't a miracle cream per say , but this comes close. Give it a try it's worth trying , get a small sample and see for yourself. I think you'll be pleased ."
I loved the night cream so thought I'd try the day formula with SPF - so glad I did! Moisturizing without greasiness. Another great product.
It a winner I love it it works great recommend to others thanks smiley360 for the free samples love them
What a great skincare product ! It works! Fell in love after the first week of use!
"I used this product along with the nighttime version. Over a couple months, I noticed my skin having extremely dry patches around my chin, mouth and forehead. It thought I was getting eczema. The only skin care routine change was this product. Once I stopped using the product, the dry patches went away."
Love the way this feels and performs. Highly recommend it.
"I have no doubt that ulitmate miracle worker does all that it claims to do. I love philosophy products, especially multi-taskers. My skin felt great the first time I used this product. HOWEVER, my allergies acted up almost immediately when I used this product. The perfume in it is so strong it made my eyes water and my sinuses swell. I sneezed for a good twenty minutes after I applied it. This is not the product for me, or for anyone who is sensitive to perfume. Try again philosophy. This one is a miss."
