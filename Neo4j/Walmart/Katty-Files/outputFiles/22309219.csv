"Having used this for so many years, I can't imagine being without it. The mild citrus scent makes me happy, as does the sunscreen and price. I use an arsenal of products, but this or the night version are my daily warriors. It hydrates, protects, and fights my wrinkles, uneven skin tone and dullness."
This product is mild enough for my sensitive skin. I noticed a difference in dark spots and fine lines in 4 days. No breakouts or rashes that other sunscreens cause me.
Has retinol -which is clinically proven to keep skin firmer and helps to lighten and dark areas. I have used it about 5 years and it works!
"This stuff really works! I thought it was rather expensive when I purchased it, but it is worth the price. After only 1 month of use, my dark spots are almost gone!"
It works. Try it.
You can see results within days. Would recommend.
"I started using this on 9 Nov 2018. It has been 11 days now and I do see a difference in my skin. My face has red areas and this product has gently exfoliated the area. Leaving new skin. The redness has improved but it hasn't completely gone away. Am hoping, with continued use, it will. I am happy with the results. Will continue to use this and do recommend it."
I ordered this product to get rid of my very faint brown spot. Unfortunately this product has not improved the look of my sun spot at all despite religious use.
"However, my cheeks do look a little more radiant."
"Irritared my face , burned my face. Not good for me"
Works great and makes me feel better about me :-)
It's been a week so I'm still waiting to see a change in skin tone.
Never thought I could find a product that would help get rid of the marks I've had on my face for years! In just one week not only have I noticed a difference so have others. I feel with continued use of this product very soon I won't need to wear foundation to hide my skin but to enhance my looks.
"I had high hopes for this product due to my blotchy skin & Neutrogena's reputation. I started using the Rapid Tone Repair day moisturizer and Rapid Wrinkle Repair night moisturizer a week ago. I'm not sure which is causing it, but I woke up with large red circles around my eyes yesterday including my eyelids where I don't use product. My skin is dry and scaly and my eyes are puffy. I have stopped using both products in hopes my skin will clear up."
"I am 46 years old and have had 7 children. I never fully lost my pregnancy mask. I saw this product on the Today show and thought I would give it a try. To my delight after just 1 week, my skin is softer, brighter, and the mask on the sides of my face is lightening up. I will continue to use this product."
"I am 50 and will continue to use this product. I used Garnier spot reducer for a year, no real results. Today I went to the office without going through my usual foundation and concealer routine, just a light dusting of powder. Thrilled!! It took about 2 weeks for my skin to get used to it though, so go slow."
"I had a dark, raised age spot on my cheek. I noticed improvement after about 10 days, and now, after another couple of weeks, the spot is flat and almost as light as the surrounding skin. I have never tried any special treatment on my face before. I couldn't be happier!"
"After recently turning 30, I decided to add some preventative products to my routine. Because I still battle with adult acne, retinol seemed to be the best option. I am SO pleased with this product! My skin is glowing, the texture and tone are greatly improved, and the few fine lines in my forehead and around my mouth are fading. I still have a few breakouts, but overall my skin has never been this great!"
"I've been a long-time user of retinoids, so never expected to react so strongly to this product! Neutrogena has always been my go-to facial sunscreen, and have never reacted to any of those products. However, after using Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer for 3 days, my face is puffy and broken out in large red, itchy hives! Undeniably, this is the WORST product that I've ever tried, and as a make up junkie, I've tried plenty. So very disappointed--and miserable from the itching, too!"
"Not only has my skin tone evened out, but my skin is more elastic and supple. I'm African American and I truly didn't think this product would work on my skin. I'm almost 100% satisfied...still a few more areas to conquer, like my neck, but overall, it's a great product!"
"This product works wonders! As a grad student, I lack of finances force me to look at other measures in using facial products over the more expensive cosmetic-counter natural products I was used to purchasing. Knowing that Nutrogena developed great shampoo products, I gave the Rapid Tone Repair, in addition to Nutrogena's other facial products, and I WAS PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!"
"This product works! I have used Est√©e Lauder products for years but nothing was taking away the dark spots I had. I started using Neutragena Rapid Tone Repair and within a month the spots were at least 2 shades lighter and overall my skin looks vibrant. My wrinkles are also improved as well. This product has everything: Vit C, Retinol, and SPF 30. Fantastic product!"
"I have a quarter size dark spot on my face that came on with pregnancy. I have had laser treatments on it twice with very little results. I decided to try the Neutrogena product and in three months the spot noticably lighter and I no longer have to use special cover up on it, my regular base makeup covers it,"
"I recently switched from Clinique to Neutrogena thinking it would be just as good. I've had great experiences with other Neutrogena products. After a little less than 2 weeks of using this product, my skin started to dry out and peel. It also started to burn upon application. RIght now my skin has red blotchy spots and I'm hoping it goes away after 24 hours of not applying the product! Scary as this is on my face!! I've never been one to by ""for sensitive skin"" products so I'm not sure what happened here."
"Although it's title would lead you to believe it's intended use was to repair the tone of your skin, the intended use and directions on the bottle are for sunscreen. Retinal is an ingredient but it's half way down the list, it's not the main one. It's not even listed on the bottle! Product title should be ""Sunscreen with a Tiny Bit of Retinol"""
I think that my skin becomes brighter and my freckles become lighter. It has been 6 weeks since I started using this product. I am ordering for refilling. I don't think my freckles would disappear but overall it is a good experience without any allergy reaction. And I like the sunscreen aspect of the product too.
"I've been using this for about a month and have noticed a reduction in the appearance of my fine lines. However my acne prone skin is breaking out worse than it has in years since using this. I'm using the same makeup as before and am taking care to wash my face thoroughly twice a day, but still am breaking out. Too bad because I love the moisturizer and it's much more affordable than what I was using before."
"I bought this 2 weeks ago and I have only used it twice...my under eye area is rough, very dry, it burns, increased fine lines, swollen, puffy, my eyes look worse than ever like I am tired, saggy. I WILL NEVER BUY ANY PRODUCTS FROM THIS BRAND AGAIN! This reaction better go away! If I could give this no stars I would!"
I bought this product as well as the rapid tone and repair dark spot corrector for under my eyes to help even out the tone of my face. After just 2 days of using this my skin starting getting really scaly and red. I know my skin is sensitive but neutragena has always been the brand recommended by all my doctors so I bought it with no hesitation.
I bought this products a week ago and I am so happy with them...I love all Neutrogena products!
I have been so pleased with this product. I have noticed a positive difference in my skin and so have others. I recommend to all!
I started using this before my daughter's wedding a year ago because I had some dark areas from sun damage. It evened my skin tone and my pore size is better as well.
Used 4months and it did nothing to clear my brown spots. I have Carmel skin tone. I'm 49 and have developed sun or age spots on my checks in the past few years. Nothing works. I always use sunscreen
I started using this product 4 days a go and I already see my blemishes getting lighter.. It is very cost effective and works great. I would recommend this product
This product along with the night formula is helping my dark spots fade. I have tried so many things and this has been giving me consistent results. Over all very happy with it.
Within 2 weeks I noticed positive results. A month later I noticed my dark spots on my cheeks gradually lighten. It leaves your skin feeling very soft. I highly recommend this.
"Neutrogena, Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30. This is a great moisturizer and why should I trust my skin with other products. I will never use anything else. Thank you Neutrogena!"
"I bought this product a days ago, it seems nice and it smells good actually, but I have doubt, can I use this product? Because I'm only 19 but I have some stains and my skin has uneven tone, I mean, am I too young to use this?"
"I am amazed with the feeling of this lotion. I wear it every day, and hope that the blotchy dark spots will totally clear up. Would recommend this to everyone!"
"This is a very good moisturizer with the added benefit of sun screen. I do think it is quite expensive, but other than that it is a great skin care product."
"Love this product! Goes on sheer feels like I'm protected without the thick heavy feeling of a sunscreen. Leaves my face ready for makeup without a cake feeling, and with oily skin, this product holds that at bay all day, no more blotting!"
"I've been using this product and notice a big difference in my skin. I am 55 and have slight lines and some discoloration. My skin tone looks more even and brighter, smoother. Can't wait to see how it looks after using it longer. Love it :D"
"This product feels wonderful to my skin. I love it! I've only used it for a few weeks, so it's too early to see the results for anti aging! I'm sure I'll look years younger soon. I highly recommend this."
I'm absolutely amazed with this product!!!! My wrinkles are almost gone!!!! I bought it for sunscreen and lost my wrinkles!!!!! What a wonderful surprise!!!! Just ordered 4 more!!!!
"I used it only 3 times, morning, night and the next morning. My eyes were puffy with a lot of wrinkles and red skin around my eyes and flaky itchy skin as well as on my neck."
Burned and irritated my face causing a rash with in a few hours of applying. Even though I normally dont have sensitive skin. Left with dry flakey skin patches by the next day.
"This product makes my face feel silky smooth and hydrated, it smells really good, but I have not noticed any improvement in the tone of my face. I have had the product since August, and have been using it every night since about two months ago. There doesn't seem to be anything ""rapid"" about the ""tone repair"". Perhaps I am just using the wrong product, but I am disappointed that I spent a good amount of money for a small amount of product in a thick, heavy container that hasn't done what it claims to do."
I am very happy with results so far.
"I've used this and the nighttime tone repair moisturizer for over a year. It's finally dawned on me that the products are causing more redness instead of lightening my brownish spots and evening my skin tone.. I've been very careful to protect my fair skin since moving to FL from CT, but obviously thus isn't the answer. Wish it had become obvious tome sooner!"
"Due to many years spent on the beach slathered in baby oil, I have uneven skin tone & dark spots. I've just started using the Rapid Tone Repair, and it is already making a difference! It glides on to skin, has a light, pleasant fragrance, and absorbs in seconds. I have lots of skin sins to atone for, and this is one of the products helping me do just that. My skin tones starting to even out. My dark spots are fading. This leaves skin soft and smooth. I give this an A+!"
I bought this and the night time rapid repair. I have been using it for over a month and my brown spots are still there.
I started using it along with the night treatment to get rid of the acne dark spots and my skin looks so much better now. I love it.
I have actually used this product before and knows that it really does work...No puffing here by the manufacturers!
"This product did not work for, I bought both day and night cream , I developed redness and rash on my face that is taking time to clear."
I bought the complete line and I had to stop usingit because turn my face too oily and I havent seen any result.
I would say that it is too heavy for my skin and leaves uncomfortable feeling as well as the powder does not lie on it.
"I BOUGHT THIS BECAUSE I WANTED A MOISTURIZER, SUNSCREEN AND AGE SPOT CORRECTOR IN ONE. JUST STARTED TO USE IT...I HOPE IT WORKS ON THE DARK SPOTS"
This product really smells good and makes my skin very soft. I bought it 2weeks ago and started using it this week.i sweat right after applying it to my face. Please is it normal?
"I've used this product for years. It has maintained my complexion nicely. When I started using it, those darker shades on the sides of my face faded and are barely noticeable now."
"I don't know how well the product will work in the long run, but the perfume smell is strong enough to make your eyes water. Not a typical Neutrogena product."
Thought it removed dark spots
Have been using over a week and my skin is noticeably smoother and clearer with smaller pores . Can't wait to see the result after longer use.
"Finally a facial product with SPF30 that isn't thick or white or oily. I have dark spots and can't wait to see what this product does, but in the meantime, I am so happy to have found ONE product that does so many things and gives me the sun protection that I need. Suggestions: #1 Make an unscente version and #2 PLEASE offer a larger container. Think about it, sunscreen has to be reapplied several times a day... that little bottle will be gone in just days."
I bought the product Rapid Tone Repair moisturizer SPF 30. After the first day of the application I noticed break outs on my chin and the corner of my lips. The second day for my surprise my face was full of pimples from pin point sizes to large-a look like Rosacea- the areas were red and inflamed. So I am using Clearasil ( worked very good in the past for acne in my teens years).I will wait a week for my skin to clear up if not see a dermatologist.
"Bought this product last week and have been using it a few days now. So far, I love it. You only need to use a small amount. It is not too greasy (important, since my skin still has an oily tendency) and absorbs quickly, leaving skin soft and supple. It hasn't yet cleared the dark spots and acne scars on my face, but I do believe my skin is, overall, looking better already. Will definitely continue using it."
Had a dark brown dark red spot about 1/2 inch long on center of the nose. Rapid Tone Repair Dark Spot Corrector (Three Bottles On One Spot) has almost made the spot disappear. I still use it daily to maintain skin tone in this area. One bottle now lasts me months and works well. Recommend this product.
"Just finished a second tube. Used religiously twice a day as directed. No change in the tone of my skin. Dark spots haven't lightened even slightly. Had better luck with apple cider vinegar. Fine as a moisturzer, however."
Was so looking forward to this moisturizer and was very disappointed. It burned my face and dried it out. Used it twice a day then cut back to once a day then quit it altogether.If you have extremely sensitive skin like me please think twice about using this product!!!!!
had to stop both products... too harsh on my face.
Love this product. Skin so smooth. Less noticeable lines ...very softened.
This is my second bottle of the tone repair.. I find that it helps keep the skin tone even as long as used regularly..
"I am 34 years old and have been using this product for over a week. In the last couple of days, I have developed itchy, irritated patches on my face. Areas around my eyes are especially irritated. Very displeased with this product."
My husband and I both tried it with no results 2 products
I have dry skin and it makes my skin smooth
In a few days my dark spot had disappeared
"The product does make my skin soft, but does not show any other improvements. Perhaps my skin is beyond repair."
