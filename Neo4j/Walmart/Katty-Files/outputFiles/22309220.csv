"I used to have fair and flawless skin until I turned 36 a couple of years ago. Seasonal ""freckles"" decided to stay permanently and get worse, and my pores were becoming visible. Other brands like Murad workes but so expensive, so I bought this a week ago since it is a reputable brand and much more affordable. I was so surprised! Within a few days, my hyperpigmentation started to fade, pores becoming less visible, and my skin glows. It's been a week, and I am excited to continue using this."
I was introduced to this product along with the daytime several years ago and continue to use it. Love it!
Been using this product a little under a month. It has my skin feeling soft and smooth and my skin tone is even. Very happy with this product
Keeps the brown spots away and your skin smooth. Only need a small amout. The bottle lasts a long time for the price.
I bought this product and I want to know before using it if it suits my age as I am 27. Along with it I also bought the hydro boost serum. Please advice if I can use and which one to use first.
"Very nice, I noticed a difference in my tone in about a week, smells great too."
I was really surprised how quick it worked.
"After using another night cream for 2 years, I decided to try the lesser expensive rapid tone repair night moisturizer by Neutrogena. Unfortunately, my wrinkles are no better and may be a little worse. Guess I'll have to return to my previous expensive cream, i'm Disappointed."
"After washing my face, I put this on my face and it started burning and turned red. I had to get it off. The next day I noticed my skin was dry and flaky where the tone repair burned and had red spots. They were gone after a few days, but I thought Neutrogena would be good on sensitive skin. That's how everything I read sounded. I also bought some anti-aging moisturizers and can't use them either. I am still using the face washing which has been working great for me."
I have this product and the Hydro creme gel as well as daytime moisture.
"I am a 55 year old with oily, sensitive, acne prone skin. I've used a lot of products over the years, but now I'm experiencing ingrown hairs on my chin which result in dark spots. My doctor recommended retinol. I had to wait before my insurance approved it, so I bought this product. My face is like night and day now. No more ingrown hairs on my chin. My dark spots on my chin are lightening. My face all over is looking much better. I love this product!"
"I've been using this product in conjunction with the dark spot remover (to target the worst areas) for 2 months. I took before and after pictures; there is zero change and now that's its summer, even with the neutrogena 70 sunscreen ,they are just getting worse. I wont be buying this again."
"I have been using this product for two weeks. I am beginning to see it working on my dark spots. I am 60 and all the years I have damage my skin it's going to take a while to change the even tone of my skin. So if I can see a improvement in two weeks, what does that till you. yes I will be getting a second bottle when this one is gone. And it works as a good moisturizer as well."
"I have really bad scars on my cheek, I had about 5 dark scars on the right cheek and they were all in a group. I would put as much foundation as possible to hide them, it wouldn't work. When I found this, I was so happy!! I didn't see results in a week (using morning and night), but after about 2-3 weeks, they have slowly diminished and now I only have 2 scars left! This is quite a small bottle, but when used well, it can really do what it says!!"
"Love this product. Great value for the price. Works better for me than some of the higher priced products. If you have sensitive skin, I'd suggest using this every other night at first. I use it with the day Rapid Repair SPF 30 and love it, but I had to build up to using them both every day. Wish Neutrogena would list the concentration of the active ingredients in products. It would be a help. Love Neutrogena products. This product really helps the tone and overall clarity of my skin. People have noticed. Love the Vitamin C."
"I've tried several products for my dark spots, from the high end brands to the drugstore ones. I saw this product and decided to give it a try, since anyway, nothing was working for me.... Big surprise! I've been only using this moisturizers (night and day) for three days, and I can see a noticeable difference. Incredible, my dark spots are almost gone. I have oily skin, prone to acne, and this product doesn't cause me any break outs. I hope they never discontinue it, because it really works."
"I am so happy to have found this product. I started using it because my mom uses it and loves it. I am 19 years old and I also love it. It makes my skin feel SO moisturized, hydrated, and healthy. I love how it makes me skin so smooth and supple. It lasts throughout the whole night and really gives me the moisture I need, I don't know how I ever lived without it!!"
"I have tried many tone repair products that I almost gave up. This product works so well with my skin its unbelievable. I have been struggling with dark spots and discoloration for many many year now, and within 1 week my face looks GREAT. I can not believe how well this product is. It does not leave my skin oily or anything. It smells fantastic, not to frangrancy. Thank you Neutrogena!!"
"Cannot live without this moisturizer! My skin has never looked better, and all spots are practically gone!! I did my skin damage in the '70's, using baby oil and iodine. When I turned 50, all the spots came to the surface of my skin. Rapid Tone Repair Night Moisturizer is THE BEST on the market, hands down. I am now 59 and pass for age 40! And those compliments came from men, not women. This moisturizer will never leave my makeup bag."
"I have been using this product for around 1 1/2 weeks, and I see a noticeable difference in my skins tone and texture. It's working better than some of the higher end creams I have used in the past. I have not had any adverse reactions to the retinol, and I use 2 pumps every night. Love it!"
I trust this brand. Its been around for years and usually has great products. But I find that there is no product I've tried can help with dark spots. I have been using this for a while now and I'm not seeing any results. I'm not sure exactly how long it takes to see a difference. But I faithfully use the night and day products. I also use a serum in conjunction with the moisturizer. I feel like the products are ok for softer skin but there's no change in my skin tone.
I used this Night cream after trying many of various brands. This is definitely better than any other. It helped me to make my skin look and feel healthy. I can notice the skin tone getting even. It made my skin smooth. I have been using the product for two months. It is about to get finished. I wish to continue using the cream.
"I used this product for months and saw no improvement. Several years ago, Neutrogena offered a more affordable product that helped to even skin tone - I think it had soy in it. That product seemed to work well for my skin but was only on the market for a short period of time. Since then, it seems as though the products (from Neutrogena) that focus on skin tone are more expensive yet less effective."
"I've been using this moisturizer for a few years now. I absolutely LOVE it! I was looking for a moisturizer I could use at night that would boost cell turnover. It softens my skin, evens out the skin tone and it even clears minor breakouts. Please don't ever discontinue this, there is nothing else out there like it."
Ive been using this product for more than 3 years . Its the only product i trust.. Its a spa for the face every night i moisturize!!!! Once product its adjusted to your skin and clears all the impurities !! Would do wonders to your face.. Thank you Neutrogena for not discotinuing this product !!!
"This makes my skin glow, keeps it clear, and I've tried so many moisturizers to be able to use Retinol, and this is the best. Plus it has Vitamin C too. I went back and bought the Face Serum, and the eye cream, and I love them too. My face ""glows"", and it looks firmer, and better than I've seen it in ages. LOVE it!"
This may have some good attributes but if you have wheat allergies beware! It contains xanthan gum which many times is grown on wheat grain. It can absorb into your system and cause the same reaction. I don't know why so many products have this added now and it is not necessary. Even most gluten free breads contain this awful stuff. This product plugged my pores just after a couple of applications. I have oily skin.
"I started off using this product twice daily, but it made my skin flaky so I reduced to once daily (only at night). I use the night repair lotion primarily on my jawline where I have dark spots/discolorations due to acne scarring. It hasn't made the spots disappear, but my skin overall in the area looks brighter and hydrated when I wake up in the morning. I like the citrus smell, and I think the lotion rubs into the skin well."
Was using a much much more expensive night cream & never saw results. I grew up on Neutrogena & decided to go back to my roots! This does not break me out or clog my pores. I only use it at night. I have lots of sun spots & acne scarring & have seen a NOTABLE difference after using this. I will continue on buying more Neutrogena products. The other Neutrogena products i purchased with this one i am also happy with!
Do I get dark spots from acne and u evenness from sun damage .... I've committed myself to the night time one and another neutrogena prod for morning ..... my best friend is a professional make up artist and used me as a model last night and she couldn't believe how great my skin is beginning to look.... I see a difference as well and surprisingly have had many compliments. I will keep on my regimen :-)
Within the first two weeks I noticed substantial lightening of dark spots and evenness of my skin tone. By four weeks dark spot had almost disappeared. I have been using this product for about six weeks now and love the look of my skin. Definitely a keeper for me.
"I purchased this moisturizer after reading some nice reviews. I am using this product for last few week, not on everyday basis. But whenever I remember to apply it before going to the bed. Everytime when I used this product my skin is peeling. My skin was healthy before but now has dull look and rough dry patches on the face. Its an expensive waste product. Did not expect this from Neutrogena."
I've used this product for a week and already see a difference in lightening of freckles and brown spots due to past sun exposure. It feels great going on but does burn a little and seems to leave my skin a little dry.. I'm going to try and use it every other day
I bought this last month hoping to get rid of my dark spots on my cheeks but this one gave me pimples so I stop using it. I wish I could return the product and replace it with the Dark Rapid Corrector that is working good so far for my sensitive skin.
"I've been dealing with Rosacea for a few years. Nothing seems to help it very much. My cheeks get really red and flaky. It hurts sometimes. After my last flareup, I decided to try to find something different. I started trying it a few days ago and I'm already pleased with the results. I have very sensitive skin and I haven't experienced any stinging when I apply it. My face feel softer, the flakiness is reducing and so is the redness. The scent is a tad much but it's not unbearable and I will continue to use it."
"I added this moisturizer to my routine because I wanted a retinol product that would be healthy for my skin and encourage cell turnover. I am so happy with the results! I try to use it every other night alternating with a more targeted product (for adult acne), but I want to use it every night because my skin is always glowing the morning after I use this!"
I have been using this product for almost two months and I have not seen any results even after finishing the second bottle. I have been consistent with the application of the product every night and I can honestly say it has made no difference for me.
"I love this stuff. It is my go-to night moisturizer. I use it for acne, preventing wrinkles (I'm in my 30's, they were beginning), and dark spots from sun damage. It has been AMAZING!! Helped with everything!! I first started using a much more expensive sample of another product, and saw this on a makeup review, and it works just as great, for half the price! It has made my skin so gorgeous. I've never had really good skin, and now I feel comfortable and glowing in my own skin! Can't thank Neutrogena enough!"
"I have purchased this night moisturizer a couple times already. I do believe the Retinol SA and vitamin C help even out my skin and make it feel like silk the next morning. When I have run out of it in the past, I definitely noticed a difference in my skin texture. I use it every other night and I have seen good results with it. The only drawback in my opinion is the weird smell. Wish it could be infused with a citrus or grapefruit smell but I know some people are sensitive to fragrances."
"I tried the product to help with acne scars. It works well, and gives my skin a a slight glow."
I used this product for a week and I am so disappointed. I look like I got burned. I don't know if the thick patches on my face will go away if I continue to use it or if I should stop using it altogether.
"Yes, I was skeptic but seriously I do see a difference in one week...so much so that I going to try the day moisturizer as well! I've been using Neutrogena products for years (I'm over 45+) and have spent much more money with far less results!"
I've used many different products and I have to say this is a terrific product for the price . I've used it for five nights and my skn is already brighter and smoother . As long as your skin isn't super sensitive this is a great choice .
"This doea not fade age spots at all! I will say it smells great and is a great facial lotion, it just does not do what its intended to do. Super disappointed as is not exactly affordable."
I have been using this product for over a month and I see no improvement in my skin tone. I am 66 years old and have some uneven tones and age spots on my face and I see no difference with this product.
I keep reading 1 star reviews about redness and peeling. Retinal is an exfoliate. You might peel depending on your skin type. I love this stuff. I Combine it with a hyaluronic acid and my skin feels baby soft in the morning. I'm glowin hunny
"I'm using the whole line and my skin feels and looks great! I've used other skincare products and Nuetrogena is the best fit for my skin. Plus, it's affordable!"
I am very pleased with the results I have had in just a week. Dark spots are beginning to fade a bit and face generally feels much tighter. I will continue using and look forward to seeing where I end up.
"Used less than 2wks. Face first started to feel dry then began forming patches of peeling, dry flaky skin. Then got a terrible red, itchy breakout or rash all along entire jawline & part of cheek. Stopped using & rash hasn't subsided. Never again!"
"Great moisturizer but as for evening out my skin tone, not so great. I haven't seen any improvement and I've been using for about 4 1/2-5 wks now... What a disappointment"
"As an 18 year old that suffers heavily from dark circles under the eye I was wondering if there are any products best suited for me. I'm trying to reduce using makeup and want to invest in a cream or anything of that nature that will heavily reduce my dark under eye circles, I'm not really looking for FAST results but soemthing that definitely works! Any recommendations??"
This product is a little too greasy for me. It made my skin soft but it gave me pimples. I'm not sure if I'm applying to much on my face or not. A pump barely spread around my nose and forehead so I usually use a pimp and a half. It still seemed like a small amount but either way it made me breakout in my problem area which is my jawline. I don't get breakouts often so I know that it was caused by this product as soon I stopped using it the pimples stopped coming. I won't be buying this again.
"I am on the same page with some customers here, specially with Paris. The product is no able to repair my tone simply because I quit I used it for one week then I got a terrible itchiness that I attributed to a sunburn and swimming but when I used it again the itchiness came back and I got dry and thick patches!! I dont see any improvement. Not even susing it every other day. As soon as I go back to use it my skin gets so much sensitive that I do not tolerate the heat or the water. So totally not recommended at all."
I am using this product for 3 days. My face skin peeling off and very sensitive . What should I do? Please help me...
I'm considering between this product and wrinkle repair product. What is the retinol concentration difference between the two?
I have tried many expensive brands--This has done great things for my skin--clearer and brighter than before Thanks
"Love Love Love this product,it even out my skin tone,and also give me a beautiful glow.thanks for such wonderful product!"
My dark spots get more darker after using this cream and now after a month i am going to stop using it .
"am 63 years old use to have creases under eyes from sleeping on my stomach,started using this morn and nite,they are gone!!!!! no joke ,this works"
"I am very happy with this product. Good moisturizer for my skin, I used it every night before bed for the last 2 months. So far so good!"
"I started using this cream a week ago, the results I saw immediately, but today my face started to burn especially under the eyes. What I can do? Thank you"
My husband has noticed a difference after only one week. He thinks my skin looks brighter and firmer. The darker spots are fading but still need more time to vanish. My question is : I am using the Rapid Repair Wrinkle Serum in the morning and then the Rapid Tone Repair Moisturizer at night. I was wondering if it's ok to combine these 2 products in the same day. I have noticed my skin is beginning to burn a bit at night.
"I've been using the Rapid Tone Repair moisturizers, both day with sunscreen and night, for almost ten years. I used to try something different once in a while, but always went back to these. It really helped with my adult acne and splotchy skin. Now that I'm in my fifties, I might try the line from Neutrogena for wrinkles. I love Neutrogena products and couldn't be happier."
"I really enjoyed this product, smelled nice and felt great on my skin."
"I started using this product two weeks ago and already notice my brown spots fading,"
Does this help with acne scars or no? I have sensitive normal skin with hyper pigmentation.
Wanted to know if the tone repair helps with wrinkles also
my dark spots are lighter my skin is soft and healthy looking. i like this product
I used this product for 2 months and didn't see any change.
You need to be consistent with usage for it to gradually diminish spots and brighten skin.
Wanted a night cream that could help with some crepiness under my chin
I'm planning to buy this product but I'm not sure if it will be helpful for acne prone skin.
"Sometimes my skin gets so dry and scaly,"
also there is apparence of fine lines on forehead and around the eyes.
"The pump did not work the second time I used it. Unlike other containers where you could cut it open to get all the product, this one is either glass, about half the product was wasted. I was very disappointed that it did not feel that it moisturized. I have always liked Neutrogena products, but this experience has caused me to think twice before I make another purchase."
"I used Neutrogena Rapid Tone Repair night and day for 7 days and after seven days I realized that my skin started to peel and I recognized white spots. I am really disappointed about it, although the online review is really high. I recommend people to ask the doctor before using this product. I got this product to reduce light freckles."
I bough this product a two months ago. It did nothing for my discoloration or my pores!! I am so disappointed! It claims it has retinol so it should have worked!!! All of my facial products are Neutrogena so I wanted to continue with the line but this moisturizer is a joke.
"I just bought this product 2 days ago so I can't tell if it works or not but I wanted to ask Neutrogena, does this product is non- greasy/ noncomedonegic? my skin is acne prone so I wanted to know if it will cause my skin to break out? If not it would be very useful because i'm using it to vanish some dark spots that my pimples have left."
I've used this product before and I just love it.... I will say if you are using it for the first time and are not used to putting Retinol on your face it will sting a bit. My face turned red for a couple of days and after that it was fine . I can really say that it keeps up to it's word that you will see changes in two weeks.
"I have used this since it first came on the market— usually the one with sunscreen..it contains a non prescription strength retinol that is easily absorbed and I find that it really does help to prevent wrinkles, dry skin and lines. I have tried many different much more expensive lotions that I sometimes succumb to on Home shopping TV — and none have come close in relation to the 17$ for this product."
"I started using this cream at night following an exfoliating cream cleanser and toner. Within 2 days, my skin felt very smooth and there were no red blotches on my otherwise very fair colored skin. I am over 40 and recently tried a few different night creams...this one was by far my favorite."
Amazing have been using for about a year. Will continue to purchase.
Does this product help tighten flabby and loose skin due to pregnancy?
Which is the best cleanser and serum to use with this product (I am in my late 30s)?
I love this product. My face feels so soft & smooth when I put it on. It hasn't been a week yet but I am sure it will do what it claims it will. I will keep ordering this product.
"I just started to used this product three days ago and my face is so soft,I am 67 year old been having probably with dark spot ,I really this will help my dark spot and brighting my face.I will continue to used this product for a month, and if I see no result I will stop using it."
"I bought this product today and am hoping that (after my dermatologist appointment today), that the dark (maturing spots as the doc called them), will begin to noticeably fade. I only used a bit today but hours later am noticing a slight tingle, burning on my skin. I'll use less tonight to see if it does the same."
"I used this product for only a week. I know the product stated some redness would occur, but after 7 days my face looked as if I had been laying out in the sun. My skin was dry, red, blotchy, and was starting to peel. I stopped using it immediately and went back to another brand's night cream. After a few days of that everything was fine. I was really excited about this product but will not use it again."
"Been applying this product for about three weeks. I thought it used to work, but as the climate got colder the dryness of my skin was palpable. My skin is okay the morning after, but as soon as my wash my face the effect is gone. It's funny because I thought moisturizers were to come in handy especially in dry seasons. It doesn't whiten either nobody can seem to notice. I am not buying this again."
I have been using this product now for almost one month and I have not seen any result.
"i used these one last 2 days, i got redness in my face and too itchy. so i stopped using this product. till now i didn't get back to normal . i strongly recommond don't use this product"
85/5000
"If I am pregnant or I am pregnant, can I use Rapid Tone Repair Night with retinol?"
I don't even know how well this product works as the moment I put it on my face I had to take it off. The fragrance is overwhelming.
I just purchased this product and the scent was so awful.....I can't imagine using it. Sorry I purchased it. Very disappointed!
Very good face cream
"I don't like anything with a fragrance. Years ago,"
although its been only a week and a 1/2 I have noticed nothing
