Love this product and have used for many years. I feel using L'Oréal Future e has kept my face relatively wrinkle free. I receive complements all the time on how young I look and I attribute this to using this product for all these years. My hope is L'Oréal does not discontinue making this product as I have found nothing that is as easy and works as well. Was unable to find in my local Walmart so I ordered on line which was a pleasure including pickup.
I love this product. I have been using it for years. I don't know why Loreal stopped stocking the market with them. I sure am glad I can still buy them on line. The product is great. It goes on light and has no odor. I really hate their new moisturizers because of the odors and extra SPF.
When I retired and stopped wearing full makeup everyday I was concerned about my skin and my dermatologist told me to use any skin cream as long as it had SPF15. I tried a few brands but always went back to Futur-e.Have used it for over 10 years. I am having a hard time finding it now but don't want to switch.

"I have used this for years. Unfortunately, I can't find it in my local Walmart. Therefore I ordered it on line."
"I have used L'Oreal Future E for many years, purchasing it mainly at Walmart. The last time I attempted to purchase it at our local store, it was not in stock or available, thus, I ordered the same."
Wife is happy with this product. She did not want as substitute when we could not find it in store. She happily waited for a trouble free shipment from Walmart.
I have been using this moisturizer for over 20 years. The only problem is that I can no longer find it in the stores. Please bring it back to the stores. Don't discontinue it. I don't know what I would use.
I have been using this product daily since I was 25 years old and now I am 46 and my skin is in great condition. I have tried other brands and more expensive products and for some reason they either bleach my skin or I have a weird reaction. Unfortunately this product is not sold everywhere as before so I stock up on Walmart.com...I hope that this product will not be discontinued.
"I have been using this for 20 years, since I was a teenager. My skin looks great and I tell people who ask about my skin about this lotion. Its not greasy, lightweight, soaks in, has sad. I can't find it in stores recently. Please don't discontinue this Loreal! It's perfect."
"I have been using this product for years. After washing my face, I put it on before applying make-up and it keeps my skin so soft. Thankfully, Walmart stills sells it. I can't find it at other places I shop. I would recommend it to anyone. I'm 66 years old and my face has very few wrinkles thanks to this product."
"Have been using this lotion for many years. Have tried other brands and other Loreal products, but they were always too heavy, too greasy or way too expensive. I use this daily, and find it's perfect moisture without any residue, but WITH sunscreen! Have had difficulty the last few years finding this anywhere, but won't do without it. MUST find online somewhere."
"This product was recommended on a TV morning show several years ago as best among products that were much more expensive. I bought it and am using it since then. It feels nice and smooth when I apply it, both morning (before applying my makeup) and evening (after cleansing) and it keeps my skin in lovely condition. I receive lots of compliments on my skin (however I can't say for sure that it's because of this product)."
"Not greasey, protects from sun, wind, cold. Almost impossible to find in stores but available on WalMart.com. Good price."
"Have used for years and really like it for my sensitive skin. This particularly one is not carried in our Walmart store. Also, it was received timely."
"This is the only face moisturizer I will use and I have tried MANY! Very frustrated with the recent availability. Please, please PLEASE, I'm begging you don't discontinue it or change it. I don't know what I would do!"
"I have been using this for many years, I can't remember when I first come on the market but I can tell you I'm 66 years old and look like 50 - I wish I didn't have such a hard time to find i (sad) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this two weeks ago and absolutely love it! Previously I had used the Hydra Renewal Moisture Cream and thought it felt too heavy on my skin. This ""Futur-e"" moisturizer is fantastic and it has SPF which is great for a fair, sensitive skin."
"I have used this lotion for 25 years. It is the best I have found. I could see the difference in my skin within a week. In fact, I have recommended it to many friends and they are thrilled. Please keep this product on your shelf, Walmart!"
Omg omg this Moisturizer is absolutely amazing. It'l does wonder for the skin and i receive so many compliments when using it. It's so hard to find.please do not discontinue and bring back the cleanser.
Highly recommend as the best facial moisturizer.
No fragrance when applying. Feels moisturizing during application. Feels like a moisturizer rather than applying sunblock which is a plus.
Because its non sticky lotion And it works really good [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Absorbs quickly.
I began using this product daily under my makeup when it was recommended by a dermatologist to a friend of mine when I was 25 years old. I am now 63. Again this week (this has happened before) someone commented that it was incredible that I have no face wrinkles at this age. I give all the kudos to this product. I recently have been having a difficult time finding it in the local stores and am having to purchase it online.
"have used it for years, I'm 65 and this keeps my face smooth and is not oily"
I've been using this product loyally for over 10 years and my skin is always moisturized and soft. I love it.
I have been using is product for decades. It works great for me as a daytime moisturizer. Lihg and quickly absorbed.
"I have been using this product for years, and absolutely love it. My biggest problem is it is so hard to find on a store shelf. Why is this?"
"Gentle moisturizer that I have been using for years for my dry, sensitive skin. If you're looking for something basic that works under makeup, this does the trick. One of L'oreal's best and most reliable (albeit less advertised) products. It's getting harder every year to find on store shelves though!"
"I love this product, but the price is kinda high.It makes my skin feel nice and soft, but not greasy. I love the fact that it has spf in it that way i know my skin is protected. All in all i really cannot complain about it. With this my makeup goes on so smoothly. I have already suggested this to so many other people."
I love this moisturizer. I have oily skin and use it too. But you did make one for oily skin too. Would you make it for oily skin again.
I have been using this product for years and find it's no longer carried in the store. I can order it through the web site and pick it up. It's the best product I have ever found for my skin.
"I have been using this lotion since 2001. It is non stick so I can apply under my make up. It not only moisturizer it is also has sun screen. I'm 43 , people say I look like in my late 20s. I would recommend to everyone."
My skin looks fresh and rested thanks to this lotion. I am 38 years old and people say I look 20. I believe big part of it is because I have been using this product everyday since 2001. Love it!
"This stuff is the best! Its really hard to find in stores now for some reason so I always stock up on walmart.com. my husband and I both use it and love it. It smells fresh, not too girly and moisturizes so well. Great that it has spf too. It's prevented me from getting burns on days when I'm outside unexpectedly. You can't beat the price either."
I love love love this lotion. I wish it was not so hard to find. It keeps my skin looking great. I have not found another lotion I love more.
