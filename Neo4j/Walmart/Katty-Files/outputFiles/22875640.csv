"This is a fantastic product for anyone who has dry skin issues on their face, or to prevent dry skin by applying daily. I am very finicky about scents- in my opinion, the vast majority of lotions made for females smell disgustingly flowery, baby powdery, etc. L'Oreal Active does not smell this way- it smells clean and fresh, and the scent does not linger for more than 10 minutes in my opinion."
"Love this product. I will never use anything else! I've used it for 10+ years and I absolutely love it for my skin. I know everyone's skin is different but for combination skin like I have, it works really well. It also makes it easy to apply makeup right afterwards. I am a loyal customer."
This is a great moisturizer I have used for years under my makeup had to order on line because they don't have in my store anymore
Really works wonders for moisturization.
I have used this lotion under my make-up for at least 10 years. I have had many compliments on how soft my skin is at age 60.
I have been using this face lotion for years. I use it during the day. It is light enough that I can use it under my makeup. I love the smell and the feel of it. It soaks in and does not leave a greasy feeling.
I have used Loreal for many years and this moisturizer is by far the best. It keeps my skin looking smooth and clear and my skin absorbs it perfectly.
"I've been using this for probably 5 or more years! It's the only face wash that has always been reliable! If I have a breakout, it goes away super fast! I barely even have breakouts because this face wash seems to help prevent them! I've been making the last few drops last for a few weeks while looking everywhere for another one! Please don't discontinue!!!"
"I bought this product because I was having trouble finding Futur-e which I used for many, many years. . I was told this product replaced the Futur-e. It had the same description but was not as creamy and not as good as Futur-e. Used it up but went back to Futur-e which was hard to find. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Yes, please do not discontinue this product and I and my daughter absolutely need this face wash. Unfortunately, I have been plagued forever with acne and now it seems as though my daughter must also deal with this frustrating circumstance. This product is perfect for managing the breakouts. At this point we've been unable to purchase it for last 3 months."
I have used this product for years but when I ran low I was unable to find it in store at Walmart or Walgreens. I was afraid that it had been discontinued. Luckily it is available on the Walmart sight. This moisturizer is light weight and has a pleasant scent. It also has a sunblock in it.
I've been using this lotion for several years now. It works better for me than more expensive moisturizers. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. It is not greasy and has a very faint but pleasant fragrance. I had to order it on line because I could no longer find it locally. (I called L'Oreal and they assured me it will still be available in 2015.) It has sunscreen as well which is a plus.
My god where had this been all my life! This face wash has eliminated my existing acne and has prevented more break outs . I wanted to give it a couple weeks before I reviewed it to work and so glad it did! I also love the refreshing tingle of the peppermint. It lasts even after u rinse it off! Ladies please give this product a chance u will not be disappointed!
"love love love this face wash!!!! controls my acne and doesn't leave skin feeling dry at all, unlike all the other acne face washes I have tried. it hydrates my face as well as treats imperfections. it is my dream face wash come to life!!! And the scrublet is awesome. can't say enough good things. PLEASE LOREAL NEVER DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT!!"
"Light, yet powerful moisturizing. Have been using it for years beneath my foundation, or alone without makeup. Daily routine. Not as expensive as some counter-bought products are also. This is truly a wonderful L'Oreal item that does not clog your pores. Very glad Walmart carries it as it saves me from running to a specialty store for it."
I love it and the price too
"tried several other products before finally found this product, unfortunately cannot buy them at store anymore"
"light, not too thick. Not greasy - I have oily skin. So this is perfect. Keeps face supple. I love it"
First time using a moisturizer with spf and really love it. I have combination skin and I don't feel like I'm greasy with it on. I'll be trying it with makeup today
"An inexpensive product that works like the most luxurios one! It cleans, refreshes while getting rid of makeup, oils and just dirt. I use it nightly, sometimes use in conjuction with a scrub. My bumpy skin is smoother. Washes clean."
Having a hard time finding this in stores anymore. Please don't discontinue it!! It is the only thing that works for me and my teenage daughter just started using mine as well.
I've only been using for a few days. First moisturizer with SPF that doesn't irritate my face or feel pasty. It smells good and goes on easily. The price was better than other brands I've used. Hope it continues to please.
"I needed something to really moisturize my skin and feel amazing, went and picked up this and I'm so glad I did I love it and it leaves my skin feeling amazing use it everyday would recommend it to everyone"
"The lotion itself is ok. But, I hate that it gets everywhere when you try and use it. The opening is too big to put a finger over and if you try and pour it out, you end up with way too much. I feel like I'm wasting a lot."
"I really like this lotion, so keep it up."
"I have been using this exact product for over 20 years and I'm convinced that it is why my skin looks so amazing even at 49! It is lightweight, smells very nice and subtle and keeps your skin hydrated ALL day. I use it 365 days a year. Plus I always give it to my girlfriends so they will get on the beautiful skin bandwagon. Buy this product and you can thank me for looking younger."
"I have been searching for a non-comedogenic facial cleanser that works well with sensitive skin, as well as having a little salicylic acid to keep acne at bay. Ive been using this product for a week now and already feel a difference in my skin. The scrublet works well to get the cleanser in every part of my face and the cleanser itself deep cleanses without over-drying. Will definitely be a part of my face routine."
Love it!! It leaves your skin clean but not dry! The smell is awesome! The scrublet is easy to use and pretty handy! Love it!!! Totally recommend it
This cleanser works well on my acne-prone skin. it doesn't dry out my skin too much but it does get it clean and help prevent breakouts.
"I HAVE ALWAYS USED lOREAL MOISTURIZER. I HAVE TRIED OTHER BRANDS BUT NONE PLEASES ME LIKE lOREAL. mY FACE FEELS WONDERFUL, NOT TIGHT OR STICKY, MORE SPREADABLEL. I WILL USE NOTHING ELSE."
"I have used this for over 20 years. It's excellent, feels good on my skin, provides just the right amount of moisture and is reasonably priced. What more could i ask for?"
"It's very creamy, not oily and the SPF helps. I have been using this for more than 20 years."
Very hydrating. I use this moisturizer for years now.
Absolutely LOVE!!! My face has never felt cleaner. The rubber scrubber that comes with it feels really good too! I have oily skin and this is the only product that has helped!
This is my first night using this. I am pleased. My skin was so soft after i washed it. It also feels very fresh. Im looking foward to seeing more results in time.
At first I was excited about using this product. The smell was amazing and my skin felt a little softer. But after 3 days of using it I saw little to no results and my skin became dryer than it has ever been. I started to get more breakouts than before and my face began burning. I don't recommend using this.
"I have used Active Daily Moisture Lotion for as long as I can remember. I am currentyly 54 years old and women ask me all the time...What do you use on your face? Your skin is beautiful! I don't wear foundation, so I can't give credit to the type of foundation I use. I recommend this product to anyone who asks."
I LOVE this stuff! I have been using it for over fifteen years and I just love it. I'm 51 and people always mistake me for my youngest son's GIRLFRIEND! He's 24! No one EVER guesses my age correctly! LOVE my L'Oreal Active Daily Moisture Lotion! Never discontinue it.
This is really a wonderful product. The price is extremely affordable and with the proper usage one bottle can last easily up to two months. I have been using this lotion for about at least 20 years and I love it. The only problem now is that less retailers are stocking it and it has become hard to find at your local drugstore. It also has SPF15 in it which is a plus. I use it both day and night IF I can find it.
"I started using Active Daily Moisture Lotion 12 years ago when I moved to a dry climate and this product left my face feeling soft and smooth and it did not cause me to have black heads, it doesn't feel heavy or pasty. Now I am unable to find it anymore. All that is available now is heavy cream that feels heavy and doesn't leave my face feeling moisturized all day."
I wanted a product that would provide a light moisture and would prevent sun damage. This product does both. Since my skin is oily now that it is summer it tends to come off my skin and goes on thicker then I would like. It smells and feels good. I do not like the bottle though. I am used to having more control on how much comes out and I was surprised on how big the top of the bottle is. I have poured too much out a few times.
Cleared up my face where other products just made more problems. Love this product!
L'Oreal Paris an excellent daily moisturizer with SPF sunscreen for great protection from Sun damage.
"I found this recommended in a book for combination skin. I have tried it for the past month and it really does nothing for my skin, and has caused severe irritation when I get it even a little close to my eye."
I have been using this moisturizer longer than I can remember. It always feels comfortable on my skin and gives it a great look. I buy it whenever I see it in a store to keep a supply on hand.
I've used this product for many years. I even have my husband using it. the only problem is we can't find it in the stores anymore. I was so happy to see that Loreal still offers this product on line.
I've tried almost every moisturizer out there and im really loving this it really does make a difference in my skin i hope it never gets discontinued.
I absolutely love Loreal Moisture lotion with sun block! I have used it for more years than I would like to say. Thank goodness it can be purchased online. It is a wonderful product and I will continue to sing it's praises to the nice people who compliment me on my skin. Please continue to make it.
I just tried this product for the first time and I LOVE LOVE LOVE IT!!! My skin feel so soft and it doesn't feel dried out like other facial cleansers do to my skin. Thank You so much for making this product I will be buying more of it in the future!!
"Works great for me, after the first use I noticed a reduction in blackheads. Keeps my face clear constantly. Not one breakout since I started use. The scrublet is great as well using it leaves my skin feeling really refreshed. I'd like to note I only use it once a day, I think if I used it a often as recommended it would dry my face out. Overall love the product, thanks for helping me find something that works!"
"It says that it will help with acne but I used it for about a week and it made me breakout, ALOT!!! I was so excited to try this product but ended up having to go to school with my face covered with pimples. I do not even have sensitive skin so you cannot blame it on that. Please do not make the mistake of buying this product."
"I bought this product because I wanted a new face cleaner that wasn't rubbed in by your hands and really helped with breakouts. So I bought it and the first time I used it, I loved it! Made my face feel very clean, has a good smell, and very simple to use. I'm very glad I bought this product!"
"At first I thought this was just another drugstore cleanser where you pay for the brand name, but this one really does work. The first time I used it it made my skin feel amazingly smooth, clean and fresh. It wasn't dry, tight or shiny after and it did its job perfectly. The scrublet makes the cleanser foam up, letting you easily scrub your face as opposed to just rubbing any other cleanser on your skin with your hands. It gets down to the pores and really cleans. Better than Proactiv!"
"I was skeptical of using this product. Because I didn't think it work for me. My face always felt bumpy and rough to the touch. And it always looked red with spots all over my cheeks. When I tried this product, I instantly felt a difference in my face. It felt smooth to the touch. And the inflammation went down, so my face doesn't look red anymore. It my 3rd day of using it and I stop breaking out with bumps and those that were there are going away. I am happy it the first product I got!"
"So I have used this moisturizer twice so far, and when I put it on it burns my skin for a minute or so, and then it leaves my skin feeling tight and slightly itchy. It also makes my skin look REALLY shinny and weird. Maybe this works for some people but not for me- I guess my skin is too sensitive, so if you have sensitive skin I would suggest trying something else first."
"1st I wanna say that this cleanser smells awesome and that the scrubber is a great idea. You can actually see the dirt. Anyway, I bought this because I wanted less breakouts. This is my 15th day using it, but I do still get zits, like one just popped up today, but I find that the cleanser dries them out cause that happened to another one. The only thing I don't really like is that it left a dark spot, but overall I like this as a cleanser and mom said that she can see my face clearing up :)"
"When I first started to use this product it didnt clear up my acne fast. I started off with a face full of acne and when i started to use this it slowly decreased after about 2 weeks. But over all i like this product it clear up my acne, cleans my face, and leaves it feeling somewhat softer."
I am a 50 y/o woman and I have been using this product for about 3 yrs now and it is perfect for my face and a plus is the spf. I have been told that I look at least 10 yrs younger which is an amazing compliment for older women. I use it night and day and couldn't live without it! Thank you Loreal for this amazing product!
"I didnt have bad acne when I bought this product, but I had enough that I thought id give it a try. Ive used about half the bottle (I figured I should really give it a chance before hating it) and my skin is worse off than it was before. Not only is my skin loaded with zits, ive got those painful skin pimples sprouting all over (Ive gotten 5 in the past 2 weeks) when I would rarely get them before. Maybe it's just the way my skin is, I dont know, but I will never buy this product again."
"I have used all types of anti breakout products, and this one seems to work the best so far. It deep cleans without over working my skin thanks to the scrublet. It smells good and doesn't have any dyes that could irritate the skin. It also doesn't dry out my skin, like other ones I've tried. My skin comes out feeling refreshed and renewed."
"I""ve tried everything over the counter and perscirption. Going to a dermatologist helped, but didn't cure and I can't afford it anymore. Fast forward 4 years. I'm now 18, less acne, but daily breakouts and nothing helps until I got this. This is the only product that I've ever had that I've never gotten new zits the next morning. A lot help, but I always have new ones. Except for this. I cannot believe that this actually doesn't do it and I would recommend it in a heartbeat to any others w/acne!"
This product really gets my skin clean and makes my face feel softer. The scrubber is cool because you can actually see the dirt and makeup on it and know that it is really getting it off your face! Leaves my skin feeling cool and refreshed! Recommened!
"I was really disapointed in this product. I used it for the first time a few nights ago, and it made my skin very oily and shiny. The next morning, I noticed tiny pimples covering my entire face. I immediately stopped using this lotion, and they have gone away gradually. I will not be using this product again."
"I have tried many products out there and nothing has worked, even the ones my doctor recommended to me. I tried this out for the first time about a week ago, and my face feels so clean and amazing!! I never really felt clean before but after this, WOW! i still have a few breakouts but other than that it is amazing for cleaning my fragile sensitive skin!"
"I started using this product about two weeks ago. I have noticed a significant difference in the severity of break out. My face looks clearer and healthier. It leaves my skin feeling cool and refreshed and I really like the scrubblet. The only thing I don't love about it, is my already oily face seems to be slightly more oily after a few hours. This product does not claim to reduce oil, but for me it makes my face a little more oily than normal."
"I literally just tried this product and I love it! The rubber scrubber really helps with getting dirt and makeup off of your face. You can actually see the dirt on it. What I also like about it is that when you rinse off the product, it doesn't make your feel like it's been stripped of it's natural oil like some cleansers do. Your skin feels soft and smooth after patting it dry. I really recommend this product."
"Opening of the bottle is too large. Pours out copious amounts of the product, which is more than needed creating waste. Perhaps there should be a smaller opening? The fragrance of the moisturizer is waayyy to strong. It overpowers any other scents you may have wanted to wear that day. These problems outweigh the quality of the moisturizer. I was so disappointed. There are many other Loreal products that I use and like, too bad this won't be added to my shopping list again."
"I have been using this lotion for years love it protects my skin and my sister who is 3 yrs younger always is amazed in my skin and her friends actually think I am the younger one. LOL. Saw it on GMA show comparing to expensive lotions and they gave this a great review it is under $8.00. I also say it is wonderful I am an outdoors person and never wear anything else on my face unless we are in Hawaii. My husband didn't like other lotions I tried to stong of a smell, this one is really lite."
"This moisturizer feels great and my make-up goes on very easily with it. I am very pleased with this purchase. The only negative comment I have is the bottle. I think it should have a top over it with a hole so you can squeeze out the moisturizer, instead of the open top."
I love this moisture please keep this product in stores easy to porches love loveeeeeee thank you.
Somthing in this burned my skin and caused it to be red and flakey
"Non greasy, smell ok too. What I don't like is the opening of the bottle, too big and you get too much at once. you end up putting back some in the bottle so the rest of the lotion doesn't stay 'clean' that way."
When I was working used a highly more expensive moisturizer...when I retired over 14 years ago I started using Loreals active moisturizer and have liked and used it ever since
"I just tried this product. I've had another 360 facial care wash and I liked it, but with this product I LOVE it. It makes my skin feel softer and more awake then ever. I definitely recommend this."
This product is amazing. Ever since turning 30 I have had a major acne problem and this is the only product I have found that clears up my acne without leaving my skin dried out and awful looking. thank you so much for creating this product
I wanted an easy to use face wash that made me want to wash my face twice a day. The L'oreal go 360 Clean does exactly that. The scrublet makes me feel clean and like every part of my face is scraped free of dirt.
This product has single handedly stopped my breakouts. My skin has a much smoother look and feel to it now and my once noticable pores are now practically invisable!
I just used this first thing this morning and I wasn't sure the scrubber was going to make a difference but it felt great. plus the anti-breakout treatment in it makes my skin feel extra clean! I've already recommended it to a few people.
"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT AND HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS. NOW, I CAN'T FIND IT ANYWHERE. HELP!!! IT IS SO LIGHT ON MY SKIN AND IS A PERFECT MOISTURE BASE FOR ME."
I love this moisturizer. It's light and moisturizes my skin perfectly. I have very dry skin and i love how it moisturizes my skin without the grease and oil. Please do not get rid of this product. It is excellent!
"Leaves my skin oily with a sticky residue. Runny lotion. Packaging is poor: Bottle has a screw-off top with a very large opening. Very difficult to dispense small amounts. Bottle is super slick plastic and when my hands got too much lotion on them, the bottle slipped with the lid off and half the product spilled in the sink. I do NOT recommend for any age group."
Great product! I've been purchasing this cleanser consistently. Helps prevent breakouts.
"I love this product, I have used it for years, now I cannot find in anywhere."
"Great product!!! Horrible packaging!!! It needs a pump or it should come in a jar or something like that, the best thing it didn't break me out!!"
"I like the ways the scrubblet works to clean skin, deep in the pores, work great for blackheads. I now have smooth clean skin."
Th product is GREAT for acne and blackheads but it does make my face sting alittle but other than that its great!
this product works wonderful for skin that is acne prone and is an every day soluution for clean clar skin without acne.
"When i first stardes to use this product smells awesome, the scruber is a great idea, my skin as a mush smoother."
my co-workers and i all bought this when it hit our selves in walgreens. it's easy to buy cheap due to sales
This cleanser leaves my skin shiny and clean without drying out. I love the scrubby - I get a mini facial everytime I wash
"I bought this product thinking, oooo! bottle is orange! im going to buy it woot woot! then. I put it on my face. SOMETHING WENT WRONG BECAUSE MY FACE TURNED GREEEEEEEN! OMG. Never buy this!"
Very happy with the product and the fast service.
LOVE IT! MAKES MY SKIN FEEL YOUTHFUL AND HYDRATED.
i love this product.
"I really like it, makes my face feel super clean and not oily and removes make up really well"
