"InstaNatural makes some really good skin care products and this retinal moisturizer is no exception. I apply twice daily. It is light and absorbs into your skin quickly and does not leave any oily residue. Since I started using this moisturizer (about 3 months) my skin is softer, smoother, fine lines and wrinkles have improved."
This is a great facial product! I love the way it makes my face feel. Haven't had a breakout since using this. You definitely won't be disappointed I know I haven't been.
"I have bought drug store, pharmacy and department store moisturizers but by far this has been my absolute favorite. I saw and felt a difference the first time I applied it to my very dry face!"
This Retinol moisturizer is one of the best I've ever used. It absorbs quickly and never leaves my face feeling sticky or tacky. It doesn't have a medical smell like most do. It really doesn't have a smell at all that I've noticed. My skin looks beautiful after just 3 weeks of using it twice daily. Fine lines and wrinkles are diminishing and my skin stays beautifully hydrated all day and all night.
This Retinol Moisturizer makes my skin look and feel softer and healthier!! It absorbs nicely and doesn't leave your skin feels greasy after using. I have sensitive skin and this product doesn't irritate my skin or make me break out. I couldn't be happier.
"Nice dispenser, works slowly as mentioned, creamy, only had it one week, so little results yet. I will keep trying to see any improvement. I will give it a chance."

"Been using this for three weeks now at night. It is a thick cream with a slight scent that goes away after a couple seconds. After applying the cream, my skin feels very moisturized. No irritation which is great since I have experienced that in the past with other retinol products. My wrinkles do seem to have minimized and my skin feels more moisturized overall. No complaints!"
I have been using this in the night time before bed. I put it on my face and neck. I also put this on my elbows to keep them from drying out. I have noticed the most improvements in my elbo they are starting to be smooth now

"I use retinol moisturizer 2x daily. I use it morning and might. Since using, I have noticed significatly smoother skin and even skin tone. It does not have a strong fragrance, so it is perfect for even sensitive skin."
I am pleased with this Retinol Moisturizer https://instanatural.com/products/retinol-moisturizer. My skin appears more youthful since I have been using it.
This product is light and absorbs very quickly! I can put my make up on immediately after applying! It doesn't effect the look of my make up and my skin has never looked better! I've seen results after about a week of use and I love it!
"I'm very surprised and off course satisfied with this product. With only a week of using it I can see a huge different on my face. I have a glow, look healthy and more elasticity."
I use this product daily to reduce the signs of aging. It has reduced my fine lines as well as smoothed wrinkled skin. The product started working within the first few days of using it. A great product!
Absolutely Love It! At my age 48yrs old I'm always looking for things to help with aging and the Retinol Moisturizer definetly helps my skin. I have been using all instanaturals products for a couple of years now.
The product is easy to blend in without causing my skin any irritation. The texture and consistency is very good and I received this product complimentary.
OMG! This is out of this world. Well! My skin was extremely dry. EXTREMELY. I actually used it for my dryness. And bingo! My wrinkles reduceing too. My skin feels baby soft and looks younger too. Good job!
This is a moisturizer that I will never be without! Makes my skin soft and fine lines are diminishing more every day!
Retinol is important for your skin. It helps with aging and elasticity. It is part of my daily routine

"My grandmother loves this stuff, and it makes a great gift."
Leaves my skin radiant and is nice on my sensitive skin!
This and the other Retinol product are a combo made in heaven. Miracle effects!
I love the way this feels after a fresh wash. Smooth and silky.
It leaves my face so soft and not greasy. Perfect for everyday use! Love it!
definitely not 2.5% retinol. I see no results compare to RoC retinol and they are only .7%
