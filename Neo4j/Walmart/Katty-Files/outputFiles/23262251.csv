"This product works great. It has reduced the darkness of my dark spots, creating a more even skin tone. The treatment is great for hydrating your skin during the day and at night and the dropper measures the perfect amount needed for each application."
"I got the spot fading treatment Olay for my mother-in-law. She has dark spots on her cheeks, she started using it for past 3 weeks. I could see it is helping her skin to look more hydrated and her face looks much healthier than before. Dark spots have faded little bit but not to the extent that the dark spots disappeared. But hoping to happen soon in future. Over all its another great product from olay to try it out."
It is ok to use. Nothing much to say wow...... I have been using from three weeks. don't see any much difference....... only good thing is easy to apply good for all skin type
I've been using this fading treatment for two weeks and there's still no big improvement. It looks like many of my smaller and lighter spots have faded but the largest and darkest one is too stubborn. The eye dropper as a dispenser is easy to use and controls the amount dispensed. It is truly odorless and goes on smoothly without any greasy feeling. I'm not giving up on this product yet even if it fades everything but that one really dark spot.
"I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now. I haven't seen any huge transformations, but I do feel like my complexion looks brighter and less muddy. The spots don't seem to have much impact, but I think it may just mean I need to give it more time. As far as the product, I really like the dropper to measure out the amount since I tend to over do it with pumps. It feels good on without being greasy or drying."
I've been using this product for about 2 weeks and haven't really noticed any visible difference yet. My brown spots are pretty stubborn apparently. I will say that this does leave my skin feeling soft and smooth and feeling hydrated which are all very important. I'm going to give this product more time so the jury is still out!
"It's better value than anything you may buy at a department store but I've tried another product I recommend below instead. It's half the price and is a bigger size too. This product still works and I do see spots fade but I don't like the bottle design. I think it's supposed to be make it more ""clinical"" but it's not as easy to use and as a little bottle that you squeeze or pump."
"While I like the fact that the product is odorless, absorbs well, moisturizes and isn't greasy, it really seems to have no impact on dark spots and imperfections. It may take longer than several weeks of the recommended usage to take effect, but at this point in time, it's difficult to justify the purchase."
I have been using this product since last 2-3 weeks. I have not seen a significant change in my acne spots. It does make the texture of my skin look better & healthier. And overall my face feels a bit brighter. I will continue using it for some more time to see the results as I think fading of scars is not a quick process.
"Overall so far my skin does seem to be evening out a bit. I have not used this long enough to speak to long term effects, but it seems to be starting to work. My skin so far seems hydrated and healthy and I'm looking forward to seeing the continued effects."
I got this one for my aunty who has lot of dark spots in her face. She started to use it regularly day and night with 2 to 3 drops applying in her face. She haven't got any irritation. It showed a good result by fading the dark spots. She loved in using this treatment every day. Worth in trying out who has dark spots.
Hydrates and brightens. Spots have not all disappeared but overall texture is hydrated and less dull. I love that it doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin.
"I have a big dark spot on my face , i try to use many thing to re move but doesn't work even i been try go do the laser too but the doctor said this spot hard to re move because too deep , untill one of my friend recommend i use this product , after a few week now my spot is fading i'm so happy thanks olay."
I've been using this product for a few weeks now but have not seen an big changes. I have fair skin and a couple darker spots that I've been using this on but it hasn't made a big difference. I will keep trying to use it for a few more weeks to see if it will work.
"I started this product in Dec '14. I had some dark spots on my face and forehead. I have tried a lot of other products and nothing has worked. I used this twice a day and within 30 days I saw a difference. After 90 days I saw a big difference and have continued to use it. It took a long time for these spots to appear and I know it will take a while for them to totally go away, but without a doubt this product has faded them a lot! Yes, I highly recommend this product!

"After using this treatment for 3 weeks, I noticed a considerable difference with the sun spots on my face. I was quite surprised that the treatment worked in such a short amount of time. I will definitely continue using it!! I even recommended it to my friends & family!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I would only apply this to my forehead, as I have a lot of acne scarring in that area. I did not get to use this product enough to know if it works, as it seemed to cause break outs. It is a very greasy consistency, but my very dry skin does appreciate that aspect. I would still recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used exactly as described, in the am and pm using moisturizers and cleansing properly. I have a medium olive complexion with normal (not too dry, not too oily) skin. I wanted to use as I have some dark marks above my eyebrows due to waxing. I stopped waxing a couple of years ago switching to threading instead and that has helped lighten the spots some. This product has done nothing to improve the dark coloration."
My wife is using it for last 3 weeks without much success. I have seen only faint improvement on her acne spots.
This product works well on sensitive skin and diminishes dark spot. Another plus for me is that it's fragrance free.
The only question / confusion she had was how she was supposed to use it with her other products she uses on her face. So she asked me to rate this 4 stars.
I love the effectiveness of this product. I can see dark spots fading after 2 weeks. Impressive.
Easy to use and improve the skin texture.
"Used for 2 weeks no results yet, I will use it till its finish."
"I've always been disappointed with the results of fade serums, but not with Pro-X. While results were not instant I can honestly say that after 90 days the few dark spots on my face are barely noticeable. For now on it's my go to fade serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I like the idea of the serum, however I have been using tis product for 7 months and I think my spots are expanding instead of lessening. I went thru winter with no sun and still it looks worse. I just switched products and hoping for better results."
"I read to spend almost 100 dollars on Mursd and was never all that satisfied. This however takes the cake. I wasn't expecting a miracle, but I did see improvement. Plus I got a glow I never thought I'd see again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use Olay spot treatment twice daily. At first I did not see results. After 3 weeks the age spots started to fade and now after 3 months the spots are almost gone. Pro X was the only product to significantly fade the spots and reduce their size without irritation. It takes a while to see results and you have to use it consistently as well as use sunblock daily .Olay spot treatment leaves your skin soft and seems to fill fine lines. love this product.

"I've used this product for over 9 months I've seen my dark spots go from very dark to almost nothing. I see such a difference on my face and arms and I can tell you this product does what it claims and more I started to see improvement within a month. I have sensitive skin, my skin tone is not always even, and it gets oily on the T area easily. This product balanced my skin tone and keep it hydrated. I buy it all the time and definitely will continue to over and over again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I use this every morning and every night and it really works. The marks on my face have faded and my complexion is much more even. I love that it doesn't leave my face dry or make my skin peel like some other products I've tried. Q [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have used this product on my face for over 6 weeks and do not see any change in color of age spots
This product did not work at all. Used it for 2 months and NO results. I do not recommend this product.
