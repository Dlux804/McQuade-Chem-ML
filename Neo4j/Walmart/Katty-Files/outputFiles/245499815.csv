I have been using Nadinola on my face for 29 years
I suffer from acne scars and this product helps fade them. My teenager has begun to use it.
Bought for a 83 year old who has been using product for 30+ years.
Effective
The last time I bought this product it was the extra strength version. This time it wasn't available. This is the lower strength version and doesn't work well.
"The last time I used this product was in the mid 90s and it worked perfectly as stated. This year, I've been using this cream every day since July 7th and as of September 6th, I've seen no change. It doesn't work at all. Don't waste your money. They probably extracted important ingredients that actually faded dark spots."
