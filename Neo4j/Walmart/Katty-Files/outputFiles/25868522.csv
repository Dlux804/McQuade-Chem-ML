I have extremely dry skin and it gets worse when I am in an air conditioned environment all day. This cream works better than most of the expensive facial moisturizers I have tried. Someone with oily skin might find it too rich.
"This moisturizer works great on my sensitive skin. It is non-irritating, and does not have a perfume smell, which can cause allergies to flare. I like the anti-wrinkle feature of the cream."
I really like this stuff--there's no smell and it keeps your skin nice and hydrated. I've been using Ponds for years but like this Eucerin better. You don't need to reapply often at all. Haven't seen any reduction in wrinkles but I think I'll continue using it because I like it alot and the price is right.
"this cream is wonderful! I have been using it for over 10 yrs and it's fantastic for sensitive, dry skin. I am in my 50's and people think I'm in my 40's, so, yes it does help with aging skin. As soon as you start applying this cream your face starts to feel more relaxed instead of tight and your skin stays moisturized all day...would recommend to anyone suffering from dry skin, you won't regret it!!!!"
This moisturizer I use at night and often during the day. It is non-drying. It helps in preventing wrinkles and feels great on your skin.
Very good night cream. I have very dry skin
Within a couple of days I noticed a reduction in the wrinkles around my lips and eyes.
Love this creme! it makes my face feel soft and does not irritate my skin at all. Makes my face makeup go on more easier.
"It's non greasy, moisturizes my face perfectly. A little goes a long way. Since i started using it, my skin looks smoother and i look younger which is awesome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is very sensitive & this didn't bother me at all, fragrance free and very gentle. Nice texture, I wear it at night, might be a little oily under makeup during the day. Haven't tried that yet, but I'm 38 and my skin has been looking it lately but just after 3 days of use my skin looks plumper & smoother so this is my new #1 night cream."
"I have extra sensitive skin, and aging at that. When the usual face cream was not working, I went in search of something else, which was a costly procedure. Eucerin Q10 popped up on my search, so I tried it. I waited the usual week to see what would happen, and I did not break out in hives with it. The longer I use it, the firmer my face is becoming."
Have used this product for years. Great price and ease of ordering and picking up.
Very good quality and comfortable to use with sensitive skin
It's pretty good for sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great product. Good price & timely shipping.
"Why does the description brag ""alcohol-free,"" when the ingredients list shows three different types of alcohol???"
"WELL I'VE ONLY HAD IT A FEW DAYS, BUT I'VE GOT SENSITIVE SKIN AND NEEDED A MOISTURIZER WITHOUT AN ODOR OR FRAGRANCE, AND THIS DOES IT. IT HASNT BOTHERED ME ALL AND SKIN DOES FEEL MOIST WITHOUT BEEN GREASY."
This product is very good gentle not too heavy and moisturizes very well. I use this product for my night routine and I wake up with my face feeling smooth and a light glow.....Love it
Love this lotion! It compares to all the expensive brand at an affordable cost. My eyes are extremely sensitive and this lotion works wonders. Please keep selling this product!
My dermatologist recommended this product 15 years ago. I use it every day and it keeps my skin hydrated. Very good for sensitive skin. Would definitely recommend this product.
need to teach packers to pack better..i have to wait before i can try this product..it will b awhile b4 i go to walmart store..so i had to answer product ratings in order to relay this info..wish i knew those answers
It's okay! my dermatologist recommended i use all Eucerin products for my sensitive skin because of allergic reactions on other products. I am happy with it. Wrinkle cream not sure yet but other Eucerin products I bought works really great.
Have used this for years & its great for very sensitive skin. My store does not carry it so usually have to buy it out of town or in another store but it much cheaper here. Don't know what the difference is between this & the more expensive one online but this is great & love to save a few $$
Love this product
First cream I been able to use daily with out any skin reactions. I have very sensitive skin somewhat dry and this cream is so moisturizing and soothing. I use it day and night every day for the past couple of months. I totally recommend it. Hands down!
"Quick delivery, thanks"
Great skin crime
Very good cream
I am in my early 50s. This helped reduce the wrinkles on my neck.
It works very well. Moisturizes as well as addresses wrinkles. Very gentle and perfect for the most sensitive skin!
I have been using it for almost two weeks and people notice my skin renewed and changed for good. It makes make up Go smoothly. I loke it.
This is the only cream I will use. I am 58 and this cream makes my face so smooth. Helps with the wrinkles and keeps me looking young and healthy.
I love this cream and it is good for my skin because my skin is so sensitive. I would recommend it to others.
I have extremely dry skin .This crime is amazing under make-up and at night I can't be without it!!!!
Rich and a game changer. Good value compared to more expensive face creams.
I love this and it's great for moisture and wrinkles.
"This product can be hard to find but for sensitive, dry skin it's a must."
Very moisturizing! I can even use it around my eyes - and it's unscented.
I've been using it for years. It really works on rosacea. Great price!
Great moisturizer!! Have helped my fine lines and dry skin tremendously!!! Great results in less than a month.
I liked this product and will order again. I have sensitive skin and my skin loved it. I had no negative reactions and overall a great product.
This is the best cream I have used in such a long time. It feels Amazing and isn't greasy. Perfect to wear under make up. Great price for such a great product! I barely started using my second container so I don't know if my wrinkles have lessened but it is the Best cream overall! I highly recommend it.
I love how my skin feels after use.
Ohhhh the acne!!!! This product made my skin break out so bad ugh. I'd rather have fine lines then acne.
I'm 32 with normal skin that feels dry at times in the winter. This cream gave me whiteheads around my chin. Very disappointed as eucerin is supposed to be dermatologist- recommended brand
I took a picture of my crows feet before using and after 6 weeks I can see a difference. I can't wait to see what another month does to them. This is a great product.
"I love this face cream, perfect for my dry, sensitive, eczema-prone skin. It's been impossible to find in stores and may have been discontinued. Thank you, Walmart.com for stocking it."
This cream is wonderful. I really like the feel: not to heavy or greasy. Soaks in very nicely. And truly has no smell. I just wish that it had sunscreen.
This creme is great. I have very sensitive skin so I can't use a lot of the skin care cremes. But this works a lot better than some I've tried that have been far more expensive.
"The cream is light and absorbs easily, not greasy. It is non-irritating on my sensitive skin. I have only used this for a short while, so I have not noted any anti wrinkle action and not sure that I will, but I would use this cream anyway because it works for ""me"""
That it has CoQ10 and is easily absorbed
"have been using this for awhile, wish it sold in the store"
I hope i can find more of these product in store not only on-line.
It very smooth and silky and goes on easily. I haven't used it long enough to see if it help wrinkles. It seems to be a wonderful product.
Great moisturizer! Never irritating
This lotion feels good. it's not greasy.
I like this very much and it's a perfect gift when I visit Taiwan
Exelent!
quality

I've been using it for years. It really works on rosacea. Great price!

I have been using this lotion for over five years. I am always getting compliments on my skin and I am 62 years old. I would recommend it to anyone.
I just found this product and am very surprised to find this rich lovely cream. I have a few wrinkles now and was looking around and luckily came across this. This product will now be part of my regimen.

"This is a very nice moisturizing lotion. It is not too heavy, blends well and leave skin soft, smooth and hydrated. My only disappointment with it is that it does not provide a broad spectrum sunscreen. Please consider making this with a broad spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen, or, alternatively, leave the sunscreen out so this can be used as a night time lotion. The only reason I would not recommend this to a friend is because the sunscreen is lacking."
I always used the Q10 for sensitive skin but when I wen to replace it got confused because of change in packaging. (I didn't remember if used sensitive skin or reg but when I came home checked my empty jar and it was sensitive..guess not that observant) They both work same as far as I can tell but when this jar empties I will go back to sensitive skin Eucerin Q10 Would be so nice if these manufacturers posted there is change in product/packaging so I guess it is up to us to be more vigilant.
