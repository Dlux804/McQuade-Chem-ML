I have been using this product for many years. I have normal skin but is very sensitive. It has really helped my skin tone. I have many people tell me my skin is pretty and I'm 72! So glad I found this product and I passed this along to my 3 daughters.
"I have been using this product for many years and love the Positively Radiant moisturizer with SPF 30, put it on first this every morning and need the SPF as i have very fair skin. I also loved the fact that it came tinted and therefore did not need to use make up on a daily basis. I am unhappy that there appear to be a change in the product and am not able to find it with a tint any longer. That is my only complaint and a real inconvenience. Is there a reason that the tint is no longer available? or am I just not finding it."
"I accidentally grabbed this instead of the Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer SPF 30, which I've used for years. This ""sheer"" version made my face way too greasy/shiny! It was awful! I'm going back to the Daily Moisturizer; please don't stop making it!"
I have used the tinted moisturizer for years and now will have to look for a similar product elsewhere. This was a great product and also very popular. Good job Aveeno sending your customers to other companies.
After 2 days using this product I had a burning sensation and a rash all over my face
"After I stopped using it. my face now is extremely dry and my skin is peeling off. As much as I love aveeno,,, this one is not for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product but an so disappointed that the tinted daily moisturizer isn't available anymore!
I love these products. I have actually had people tell me that I was glowing since I started using these products (no I'm not pregnant) without being asked or prompted.
"After moving to the desert, I was anxious to try the Aveeno Facial Moisturizer with 30 SPF ( I had been using the 15 SPF). It works just as well and continues to leave my skin looking refreshed. I have combination skin and my face never feels oily or break"
out.
"Yet another Aveeno product that works great with my skin. After a week's use, my skin looks healthy and fresh. My fine lines are becoming less noticeable and positively radiant. I like the creamy and not greasy texture, light smell, and SPF 30 factor of"
this cream. A nice side-effect is that my skin seems to shimmer with this product.
"I am so disappointed in this product. I've used Aveeno daily moisturizing lotion for years. It is the only moisturizer I can use on my fact without an allergic reaction. I was hoping this other product would work. Unfortunately after one use, my face is covered in little itching bumps."
"I LOVE it. I have really super sensitive skin and have tried many expensive products only to look like a boiled lobster. This is great! It is not sticky or greasy, just a light perfect bath of moisture for my very dry skin. It lasts all day and the sunscreen is the only one I've ever used that is soothing. T"
"I have tried this product as well as many others from Aveeno brand and LOVE THEM ALL. Very calming on sensitive skin! No heavy scent, no heavy feel after applying. Id recommend Aveeno brand to everyone!"
I love how my facial skin looks from this product because it has sunscreen and is a very reliable brand. Great moisturizer! I also apply this to the back of my hands.
"Aveeno body wash cleans & moisturizes as well as soothes itching and redness of the skin. My skin is sensitive, pale, given to blushes, blotches, rashes and itching. This wash does help ease these symptoms when they occur."
Lotion is nice as well.
I do not like that their is soy in these products. I like that they are natural . I liked the spf in the moisturizer. Soy for some people with thyroid problems is not good to have more since they already have to much soy in their lives. I also do not like that their is no scent. There are natural scents that can be used.
"Have been using Aveeno products for a long time and I love them! I tried this and had to wash my face after 15 min. The fragrance was overpowering. ""If a little is good, a lot must be better"" should not apply here. And I couldn't get away from it! So had to wash it off. Will return."
The sample was too small for me to test and determine how effective the SPF is. The moisturizer feels very nice and is easier to apply than most thick and cake SPF moisturizers. I would buy it again if it weren't for the strong odor. It's a pleasant enough odor but too strong for a facial product.
"Being a senior citizen, I don't care for moisturizers that leave my skin feeling/looking oily. That being said, Aveeno Positively Radiant Sheer Daily Moisturizer leaves my face feeling moist, light, and bright! It is a tad bit pricey, though, so I use it sparingly, but it seems to last."
Had never tried the Aveeno products previous to this sample that arrived. I am a senior and daily use a moisturizer on my skin. I liked this product so well that I ordered it after using all the sample. It is very light and felt good on my skin. It also left my skin softer after just the first few uses. Great product. Thank you Walmart.
"I used the sample that was sent to me and the next day I went to the store to purchase it! I love how soft and smooth it goes on, 2 pumps is enough to cover my face and neck. This is my new favorite daily moisturizer with sunblock. Great find in my beauty box!"
The Aveeno moisturizer is sheer just as stated which works for me. My skin is normal but someone with dry skin may need a little heavier cream. I love how it just glides on and I absolutely love that it is SPF 30. It costs a bit more than some others but well worth it to me.
"This isn't meant primarily as a sunscreen, but that's how I use it. I like to wear sunscreen every day but many are too thick and hard to apply to delicate facial skin. This product goes on very easily and has a 30 spf . Most moisturizers are only 15 spf."
"This is a really nice everyday moisturizer for a very reasonable price. It's not the most hydrating moisturizer I've ever used, but if you have normal, not-too-dry skin, it should work well for you. It's rich and thick, but it absorbs quickly, it's not greasy at all, and it's got sunscreen. That's a lot of value for the money."
"I did not have high expectations for Aveeno Positively Radiant Sheer Daily Moisturizer, but it was amazing. It made my face super soft and smelled great. Most products with SPF 30 smell horrible and make you only want to wear them when you are going to the beach, but this smelled like everyday wear, which is what it has become. I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for a face moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Aveeno daily radiant isn't greasy leaves your skin smooth and radiant. Has a light fragrance and works well with all makeup.
THIS IS A GREAT MOISTURIZER LEAVES MY SKIN FEELING GREAT NOT GREASY IT SETS GREAT UNDER MY MAKEUP ESPECIALLY IN THE SUMMER :)
This goes on smoothly and I like the way my face feels. I received this product in my Walmart Beauty Box. I am considering buying it when my current cream runs out.
"I've used this every day for a number of years. I get a fair amount of compliments that I look glowing. I like to think my divinity is leaking, and from pictures of my youth, I have always had glowing skin, so not sure this product"
"I bought your Radiant facial foam cream cleanser, but it seems to dry my face more than softening the skin. Do you carry a foam free cream Radiant facial cleanser?"
"Looking for a facial moisurizer that works with a bit of sunscreen in it for summer... well you found it with Aveeno. If you have sensitive skin, this is a go to..."
"I liked the Aveeno Moisturizer because it's good to use as a sunblock, but also as a facial routine. It helps to moisturize and soften skin after cleansing. I would recommend this product and purchase as well."
I love Aveeno products and this one fits right in. This moisturizer covers smoothly and leaves my skin feeling soft plus the spf 30 helps protect my skin from the sun.
Love Aveeno products and I use this product because it has SPF 30. Some moisturizers with SPF can feel heavy and thick. This feels light and comfortable. I carry a bottle in my beach bag.
This was a nice moisturizer. Being old I get very dry skin and this product worked great for keeping the moisture within my skin. I really liked the product.
The sample came in a small bottle which allows the user to try the product for several applications to determine if the product performs as advertised. Aveeno makes excellent skin care products.
Was pleasantly impressed by the quality and effectiveness of this product. It was the first Aveeno product that I have tried and I will be trying omg others from this line
I liked this lightweight lotion for daily use. It's easily applied not too thick so smooths nicely.
It's nice it has sunscreen included that doesn't stay splotchy on your face. I liked that the scent wasn't too strong.
Aveeno Positively Radiant is a wonderful moisturizer! It always leaves my skin feeling soft but not greasy which is amazing. I wanted something affordable and also had spf. Since I've been using this I noticed it gives me a fresh glow.
"I really liked how it wasn't sticky, and worked on my very dry elbows which is a problem for me in the winter. Getting older means moisturizing often and finding a good smelling, not sticky products that really works."
Sheer but rich and a sunblock too? YES PLEASE!
"I was pleased to sample this and it just confirmed my love for Aveeno. Does exactly what it says, disappears quickly into skin and no overwhelming fragrance. Loving it!"
"Dermatologist recommended me this to try for my daily SPF needs and because it is kind to sensitive, ezcema prone skin. I just finished one bottle and I will be picking up another next time I am in the store."
I received a sample size of this product and love it! The 30 SPF is better than the 15 SPF of my current daily moisturizer. Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. I wear under makeup.
I have been using the spf30 daily moisturizer for years and loved it. I just bought a new bottle and it is not the same product at all? It has one changed word in the description “sheer”. I am not happy to have lost the moisturizer I loved.
i like that a sheer version is available (regular is too thick). Would give it higher rating if no fragrance were added. i wish all Aveeno face products were fragrance-free (or at least not added).
"I love this Mosturizer it smells great, has a light feeling. I noticed some fading of my age spot within a week! The SPF is great for continuing to protect my skin too. I would totally recommend this."
"I buy Aveeno because it sells fine products. However, the pump broke off my latest bottle although it had not been abused. I was unable to re-attach it, rendering the pump useless. I'd like a replacement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 is a new type of Aveeno. I have used various other products that they make. I don't wear makeup everyday due to respiratory issues and because of the reaction my skin has to various products.
This SPF 30 moisturizer does not burn or breakout or itch on my skin. I love the protection it gives my skin from the sun too. Thanks for making it for people like me with sensitive skin!
This sunscreen is amazing. It feels so nice to put on and works well when applying before I apply my make up. I t doesn't have a sticky or greasy feel to it and it make my skin look beautiful even when I didn't apply make up over it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Overall this is a good product. It applied easily and absorbed well into the skin. The pump has a locking mechanism which makes it good for travel. Once unlocked it took several pumps until any product came out. My skin feels smoothed clear and moisturized. It has somewhat have a bad scent but once applied I no longer smell it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The moisturizer is amazing. I have combination type skin. The moisturizer was good at taking care of my skin needs. After I put it on there was no thick greasy feeling. It made my skin feel super soft and look great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is great! Initially I found it bit tricky to figure out the how much was enough for me. I have dry skin so if I didn't use enough, my skin would still feel dry but if I used too much it would get quite oily. I found that a couple pumps are just enough. This has been perfect for me this winter season. My skin has stayed moisturized even in the harsh weather and having SPF protection makes it that much more amazing. Love this stuff. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked using Aveeno Positively Radiant Sheer Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30. It goes on the skin smoothly and is absorbed nicely. I love that it has spf to protect my skin from the sun. I live in California so it's sunny nearly every day but with this moisturizer I don't have to worry too much. I've already recommended it to several people in my life. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great product felt the differenc in my skin the first day kept my skin soft all day noticided less dry patches in areas on my checks and it definitely makes you radiate you notice a great overall glow sparkle to your skin but is not over powering [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin felt so soft and silky. It was so light weight and absorbed into my skin right away which I loved. The scent was light so that was very nice I do not like a strong scent. Having SPF 30 was a huge plus because it was one less step to take in the morning and it gave me great protection living in Texas where its sunny most of the year. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this moisturizer! It is the lightest moisturizer I have ever used that is also effective! I use two pumps and that covers my entire face and neck. It has a very light pleasant scent and doesn't smell at all light a sunscreen light almost all other moisturizers with SPF do. It moisturizes well, absorbs quickly and did not leave my skin looking or feeing greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a free sample of Aveeno Positively Radiant Sheer Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 from the home tester club and I definitively loved it. Now my two-steps process for wearing sun screen and moistusized had been reduced to a one-step since both are combined in a single lotion. It keeps my skin moisturized all day long and I don't have to worry anymore about the sun screen. I will definitely buy it and recommend it to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a good moisturizer but would prefer it in a higher SPF.
I like this product. It is smooth and feels great on skin.
"I've got this free for testing purposes in the Walmart Beauty Box, and it really helps my skin come my skin feels really soft, and smooth."
Would recommend highly. Easy to use and works great. Had several surgeries this past year and my skin is very dry and this really works well.
"I was happy to get this sample. I really like this stuff. Super fast to absorb, non greasy and no scent. Great for sensitive skin."
I love aveeno. Always have and hopefully always will. The scent is kind of like oatmeal. It makes my skin super soft
The great thing about this moisturizer is it is SPF 30; therefore it not only moisturizes your skin - it protects it to from the suns rays
I loved this! It's inexpensive and it works. Left my face moisturized and looking great. My skin actually glowed.
This lotion was really light and disappeared on my skin. I have very oily skin so I usually have problems finding a lotion that feels good all day.
Aveeno is one of my go to brands and I always buy a moisturizer with sunscreen. This is perfect even under concealer.
This moisturizer leaves your face feeling great and clean...would recommend to anyone who wants a valuable product for a reasonable price
Love this lotion! It goes on sheer and absorbs great into skin. It isn't greasy at all! Smells great too. Would highly recommend.
I have been using Aveeno products for many years. This moisturizer worked as well as I hoped. I love the fact that it has an SPF 30.
I have always been a fan of all products and all product lines of Aveeno. This lotion is no exception. I highly recommend it!
"This is a great product, it's weightless, non greasy and my skin absorbed it well. I love this product. I use it under make up."
"I love Aveeno positively radiant for severals reasons : works really good, not oily and ok for allergic people like me ...."
Definitely goes on nice and smooth yet also Blends in quickly. Has a nice feel to it. This is what I've been looking for when it comes to protecting my face here in Florida. Great SPF.
I loved using this product because it felt weightless &amp; non greasy. Aveeno was a childhood brand in my home &amp; I love using it as an adult! Wonderful product!
"My sister introduce this product to me, and I fall in love with it. The foundation plus the SPF30 has cover up some of my uneven skin tones. It also moisturize my face."
"I HAVE TRY THIS AND THIS CREAM WORKS REALLY GOOD ,AND IT REALLY PROTECTS YOUR SKIN FROM THE SUN ,I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT AND I WILL BUY IT AGAIN."
I love this product I buy this all the time for my face. The moisturizer feel so smooth and soft on my face! I love that it has the sun screen in it it to protect me from any sun damage.
I love that whether I am in a lot of sun or not I am still moisturized throughtout the day and night. My skin feels so great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I was excited to try this as I had run out of my usual moisturizer, Oil of O. I have normal skin that is not oily or too dry. The first time I used it I broke out in a horrible itchy red rash! The was two days ago and I still have the rash. I have tried AloeVera and hydrocortisone but nothing is helping. Buyer beware and be careful. I have Never had an issue like this with any product before and have no known allergies."
I was excited to receive this product as a gift as I had requested it after seeing commercials.
Unfortunately it leaves my skin irritated and dry and flaky as if it has been mildly burned. The first time I used it I felt a tingling then burning sensation. I won't be using it again or recommending it.
"I bought this to use based upon sunspots and the premise it would assist. Aveeno is supposed to be for even the most sensitive skin, which mine is not. Every time I've tried it I've broken out in a horrible and itchy rash. After seeing I'm not the only one I wonder what issue is within the product. I've done various treatments on my face prior and use nothing but an AH-BA cleanser....something is not right!"
"Great for daily use and not greasy at all. I love the protection I get, it smells great and leaves skin so smooth and moisturized. The SPF 30 is just so perfect and truly works well even one application only."

A must-have for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have combination oily/dry skin and struggle with other moisturizers leaving my skin feeling oily and greasy. Aveeno sheer moisturizer is amazing for providing a light layer of moisture that almost instantly makes my skin feel better. I love using this product under my makeup. It helps moisturize even with makeup on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried many Moisturizing products but this one by Aveeno was one of the top. The application was light which is great and hydrating for my skin. I received this product free in exchange for my honest opinion courtesy of Home Tester Club. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was so wonderful that I will be buying more when I run out! I have very dry skin and not everything I've tried has worked for me. This worked so well that I don't even have dry skin anymore! I love that it has sunblock to keep my skin from getting damaged. I use it under my makeup every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After treating this moisturizer for several days, I must say that I like it. It is soft for my skin, but it moisturizes it deeply. My skin looks smooth and soft. I love that has sunscreen. I have a combination skin, and some moisturizers cause acne outbreak, but I did not have that problem this time. I recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a huge fan of Aveeno products, but had never tried this; I tend to find face lotions with sunscreen greasy. Aveeno Positively Radiant Sheer Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 was not greasy at all! This product feels light and I love knowing I'm wearing a form of SPF daily. It's easy to apply and the product packaging is very nice. I would recommend this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the consistency of the mask, it was thin, non-greasy, and provided a beautiful, healthy glow. However, the scent of the product was too strong for me and I noticed the smell throughout the day. I loved the way it made my skin look and feel, but disliked the way it smelled. I would recommend this product to anyone who is not bothered too much by smells and wants a good daily moisturizer with SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was able to try out Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer for free through Home Tester in exchange for my review, and loved how it worked! I used it nightly after my showers, and my skin always felt so soft and smooth after using it! It's a big enough bottle where it will probably last me about a month - I use it on my face, neck, chest, shoulders, and back. It goes on smooth and doesn't leave you feeling greasy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love! LOVE! The Aveeno Positively Radiant Sheer Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 is AMAZING! It's my favorite moisturizer now. It's very easy to apply all over your face. You don't even have to use a lot. A small amount goes a long way. It helps keep my face clear especially when I'm in the sun. I use it before I put on my makeup and after I shower before I leave my house. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like Aveeno® Positively Radiant® Sheer Daily Moisturizer. It has a nice texture and feel. It goes on very smooth and absorbs nicely. It has a pleasant fragrance as well. After using it for about 3 weeks I've started to notice an improvement in my skin texture and tone. My skin is softer and skin tone is evener. I definitely plan to continue using this moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall, this is a nice moisturizer. It is a good texture (not too thick or thin; not too dry or oily) and blended in well. It had just slightly too much of a ""sunscreen"" feel to me - the scent and texture, but would be good for the summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Aveeno Positively Radiant Sheer Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 is very lightweight and gentle on my skin. I alway wear sunscreen on my face and the SPF 30 is higher than other brands I've used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Its light and non-greasy lotion. It has given my skin an even tone/texture and given my face the moisture/protection in the recent week with 40 degree weather which I always get dry patches on my face. I absolutely love this lotion and will continue to use and buy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love how it makes my skin feel while I have it on, it gives me a nice glow that I love, It makes me look healthier and less pale through these winter months. I don't have a lot of sun to worry about, but I just love how it makes my skin feel, plus.. the scent is Amazing! The only problem that I have with it, is that it did make me break out a bit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this daily. Love that it moisturizes and protects my skin from the sun. The best thing is that it absorbs quickly, never leaves my face oily, and have never had a breakout using this product. This moisturizer only takes about a minute to fully absorb. Once absorbed, I apply my foundation and the rest of my makeup. This SPF 30 truly works well and that's just with one application in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I got to try the Aveeno Positively Radiant Sheer Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30. The product itself is satisfactory and I do enjoy the formulation in that it's not to thick or oily but comforting and soft. I think it has a bit of a strong smell though and takes a few tries to work on dry patches. Overall though I liked it I love that it has SPF 30 in it and it helps even out skin tone overtime!

I like using Aveeno Positively Radiant Sheer Daily Moisturizer everyday. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth with its moisturizing ability yet my skin doesn't feel oily at all.

"I really love the scent of the Aveeno Positively Radiant Sheer Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30. I also felt like my skin was very soft after using it for a few days (very similar to other Aveeno products.) However, it would be great to have more anti aging properties included. I am always looking to reduce fine lines and wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This is a nice moisturizer with SPF. It didn't clog my skin but it did leave it a bit oily after I had it on for a few hours. It is mostly light and has a nice light scent. I would definitely use it more in the summer while on the beach/vacation, etc. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is light and smooth. A little goes a long way, which is always nice, and its one of the only moisturizers that I've used that doesn't feel oily or cause my skin to look shiny.

"I loved the light scent and super absorbent moisturizer I got to try out. My skin felt smooth and brighter than with other like products I have used.

I will definitely be purchasing this after my bottle runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found Aveeno Positively Radiant Sheer Daily Moisturizer Broad Spectrum SPF 30 to be a great daily moisturizer. My skin is very dry and prone to break outs, so I struggle to find a gentle skin lotion that doesn't leave me feeling oily. This was great. The coverage was light so I don't feel like I'm wearing anything, and it left my skin feeling refreshed. The container is tiny, but a little goes a long way. Plus, it didn't make me break out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really loved the scent of this moisturizer, though it may be slightly strong for anyone who is sensitive to scents or fragrances. This moisturizer was also very light and non greasy which was a big plus for me because I hate heavy, oily lotions and it's hard to find ones with SPF that aren't greasy feeling.
