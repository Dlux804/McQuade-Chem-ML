"After a week of using this night cream my skins looks better, smoother and fuller. Fine lines are definitely less noticeable. I have tried other brands but usually end up coming back to L'O'real products."
I love this night cream.at the age of 62 I needed a good night cream that rejuvenate my skin and this is the one.I love it its make my skin younger looking and softer.it works.thank you loreal.
"I told my mom that I wanted a night cream, she gave me this one but since she's been using it it was almost empty. She said it was anti-aging and it wouldn't make a difference BUT BOY WAS SHE WRONG! In just one use my pimples got smaller and so did my pores. In a few more uses my forehead was almost completely clear?! I don't know why it cleared my acne but I'm so happy it did! Im buying another one tomorrow!!"
"This was the first and only moisturizer I use. I tried many more expensive ones, but I keep coming back to this. Great moisturizer"
"I tried various night creams but they just “sit” on the skin. Despite the greaseless texture, it works instantly to diminish the look of fine lines. Plus it cleared my complexion. I can actually wear less makeup to cover any imperfections. Plus the fragrance is not too overpowering. All in all, I would repurchase L'Oréal Revitalift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream as part of my skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love l'Oreal Paris the 3 in 1 ...why ? I'm 74 years young lady and no one believes me ..this looks like a commercial but no one is paying me anything I'm just being honest .. I enjoying to pamper myself night and day on this cream because I love to see how young I'm looking only in a few hours
This works super well and I've bought it a few times! I would recommend it to anyone and give it 11/10 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use this nightly, and it moisturizes my skin very well. I was getting some dry skin on my neck and it's gone now since using this cream."
"I am not sure how well it works for wrinkles or firming, since I don't think I have been using it long enough to have an opinion on that."
"I can't complain about hte basic performance - moisturized without a greasy feeling. However, teh scent is relaly off-putting - not pleasant at all. I don't need perfume-y,. but I also don;t want swomething mildly offensive. I will not buy it again."
I bought this night cream because the Garnier Ultra Lift night cream I have been using for years has been discontinued. I have used the Revitalift for a week and my skin does not feel soft if anything it feels dryer.
I've been using this product for a week. My skin feels so smooth and some of my fine lines smoothed out. I actually like the smell of it!
"I absolutely love this night cream! The texture is rich, silky and smooth. The cream absorbs very well and leaves your face feeling soft and smooth. After using this cream for a few months, I have noticed a difference in the apperence of my wrinkles! Others have also. I've had people ask me what I've done to get this glow to my face. I tell them to try this amazing moisturizer!"
"I can't believe the double dose of hydration this gives my skin! I love the soft, supple feel of my skin in the morning. It has rid me of those awful dry flakies around my nose. I will definitely repurchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way my skin looks in the morning after applying this at night. it gives a wonderful, healthy glow. I tried three products from this line and this is the one that I will certainly repurchase when my current supply is done. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Well, I've been using this for the past 3 days and I e already noticed a healthier brighter looking skin tone. My fine lines on my forehead have soften. I'm very impressed. I've bought high end $300 creams and I've used lower end. This is right in the middle, I have to say it works better than the $300 cream. I'm in my early 50's and everyone thinks I'm in my 40's so.....with that said I'm buying this again once I'm out. Highly recommended!"
"This is a great night cream, but I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone other than those who have really dry skin. It hydrates the heck out of the skin and does do an awesome job of it. Can feel a little heavy, if you are ok with that."
"Before I used this, I been using Kiehls nice cream for almost 4 yrs. I switched over to this mainly for price reasons. This product is just as comparable."
"I bought the revitalift day an night cream over 3 mths ago. Not only could I not tell the difference, but my friends as well!! So much for trying to look good at a wedding!!!"
I used this cream on my upper legs where I have cellulite and it smoothed it out. I put it on my knees and stomach. Its great! It's not just for face. It does work wonderful on neck and chest. I love these products.
This product works fine. I don't look 10 years younger but I didn't expect to.
I definitely like this moisturizing cream when my skin is feeling dry. I think it is a great choice for colder months when indoor heating dehydrates my skin. I find that I need very little product - maybe a nickle size dollop for my face and neck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First time using this moisturizer. I like how it feels on my skin.
I love this night cream! It isn't too greasy and has a nice smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I read all the great reviews on this product and that's why i bought it. BUT... it did nothing for me, even after 2 weeks of applying day and night."
This cream works better than more much expensive product. I feel than my skin lifted and moisturized. I recommend this product
My skin is firmer upon waking up in the mornjng! Yay
"L'Oréal Revitalift Firming Night Cream my skin adores this product. I put it on just before I goto sleep. This night Cream keeps my skin moisturized throughout the night. When I wake up in the morning my skin feels amazing. I look refreshed and well rested. I live in a condo that's extremely dry, so any amount of moisture my skin can get is a huge plus. This night Cream has met and gone beyond my overall expectations, job well done L'Oréal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not sure that this cream (or any of the other products) actually makes the skin firmer. I will have to test it for a longer period of time before I can answer that. However, it's definitely a great moisturizer! It doesn't leave your skin feeling oily or greasy. The fragrance is not overpowering and it leaves your skin feeling smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This stuff is great. Extra thick for night time use. Scent is clean. I love it. It truely DOES work and its affordable. Leaves me feeling non greasy and moisturized. It was visible after like 10 days. I recommend every person that has wrinkle worries, try it. You will love the difference. I can almost promise this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this cream! Every thing usually burns my face. This cream doesn't bother my face at all. Can't wait for night to put this on. I am so impressed with this. Can't help but share my experience with others. Not greasy at all. Feels so good on my face. And the smell! Love it! Such a luxury. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how silky smooth my skin feels after 3 weeks of using the night cream. It looks more taut and firm. I have gotten a lot of compliments from family and friends on my glowing and younger looking skin. I recommend using all the antiwrinkle firming products together for the best results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the first type of night cream I use and I like it very much. RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming night cream is very creamy and thick. I really like the texture and amount of coverage it has with so little. Keeps my skin moisturized all night. My skin looks healthier, think it's working. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream is thick and silky. It goes on smooth and has a mild scent similar to the other products in the line. This product is a little too thick for my oily skin but I think it would be very hydrating for other skin types. Added bonus, the blue container makes it easy to tell apart from the day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this night cream a lot. It's super thick and leaves my skin really smooth. The scent is very nice and not overpowering. I get really dry skin and this cream helped my skin get back to normal. I think it's helped with the small wrinkles on my forehead as well. I used the day cream in addition to this and they've diminished quite noticeably. I'm definitely going to keep this in my nightly routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I get a bit of a tingle when I apply this night cream. It's thick, but smooths on easily. I don't mind a heavier cream at night and I like the fragrance of this cream. I've been using this only for a few weeks, so I'm not seeing drastic results yet, but I do feel like my skin is softer in the morning after using it. Overall a nice addition to my routine. I have been using a bit of the firming eye cream over it on my crows feet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this product nightly for 3 weeks straight now, I can say my skin feels velvety soft and smooth. It has definitely improved the texture of my skin. Also it has improved the elasticity. It feels tighter and more toned. It was easy to use, and definitely could see results in the past three weeks. Can't wait to see what the future holds with using these L'Oreal products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I haven't really noticed much difference with this cream. I have been using it nightly and do not see any noticeable improvement in wrinkles but I must say that the cream does moisturize. My face doesn't feel as dry in the mornings and I have been having to moisturize less during the day and wholeheartedly believe that is because of this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream for four weeks. I have not seen any improvements in wrinkles and lines. But, this product seems to have improved the overall condition of my skin. My skin is smoother and softer than before I used this product. This cream works great as a moisturizer and doesn't leave my skin oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that these products are quality! I feel like my skin looks tighter and brighter! I know it's from the moisture! I didn't have a face routine before trying this product but I will have one after this campaign is done! I didn't realize how thirsty my skin was. I put it on generously starting in the spots that I usually put my foundation. If you don't have a face routine I suggest trying this if you need moisture! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think revitalize ant wrinkle firming night cream is a great product I used it for one week straight only before going to bed, I noticed after a few days my skin and neck are seemed and actually was firmer, It works and a fabulous product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anit-Wrinkle + Firming night cream. At first when I put it on, my skin felt soft and smooth. However, after a couple of hours my skin was really greasy. I also started to breakout after using the product. The scent was just right. It did look and feel like the night cream was working. If you don't have oily skin, this would be a product that would be great for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'OREAL anti wrinkle + Firming night cream is a great product. It really works great for me. I used the night cream and it real helped with my deep wrinkles and with my helped with my smile lines. Its not greasy feeling and a pleasant fragrance. I definitely plan on using it from here on out. I do recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night cream is a great moisturizing night cream. I did not notice any additional benefits beyond it being a great moisturizing cream. The product has a little more fragrance than I would like for a night cream but did massage in to the skin very well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream and it is great! It has a light feel to it and it is not greasy at all. After I apply this cream, it almost feels like a cooling sensation. I will definitely keep using this night cream and I can see results. I would recommend this product to friends and family! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My face feels great after using these products. My skin is soft & looks more even. The smell isn't offensive. The regimen is easy to follow & keep up with. After paying for ""over-priced"" high-end stuff for years, you have converted me & my wallet thanks you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love the Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle & Firming Night Cream. It makes my skin smell so nice and feels so lightweight on my skin. I wake up with really refreshed skin that looks very healthy. I do see some tightening around my mouth and some wrinkles seem to be smoother. My husband also likes the way I smell when I come into bed and the softness of my skin. So that's a win win in my opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used Revitalift anti-wrinkle +firming Night Cream every night for 4 weeks. I am thrilled to report my skin feeling soft and smooth every morning. The cream goes on easily and is absorbed nicely into my skin. My face stays moist but NOT sticky. On the down side, this cream has a fragrance that bothers me. This fragrance does dissipate after application. Wrinkles? I still have them, but my skin is soft and firm. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I really haven't noticed much of a difference, this night cream does leave my face feeling soft. It has a nice light scent and for a thicker cream it absorbs pretty quickly. As it's a thicker cream I like to use less than I do during the day so as to not leave my skin with a greasy feeling. My skin's sensitive and breaks out easy but not with this cream. I would definitely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a lover of all things L'oreal. I was super excited when I received the products. Although it is hard for me to follow a regiment every night, I do a good job of using the L'oreal Paris Revitalift Anti-Firming Night Cream. It is creamy withoout being greasy and feeling heavy on my skin. I find my skin is much more moisturized and smooth because of it. I am not disappointed with the outcome so far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Of all the L'Oreal ReVitalLift Products I have tried over the last 4 weeks i must say that the Firming night cream is my absolute all time FAVORITE. Makes my face feel firm and less stressed and I will continue to purchase this product for my nightly regimen. I feel like I have seen the most results with this cream and have been the most impressed. I have loved these creams and will continue use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was terrified to try this product! I have extremely oily skin and I was really afraid to ADD any moisturizer to my routine. But I'm glad that I did! After 4 weeks and NO break out, yes, you read that right, no break outs! My skin is actually leveling out and all the oily spots are no longer as oily. Plus it is tightening my skin and the fact that I can use this at night and get all these great benefits while I sleep is a super bonus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Old age is starting to catch up with me and it's starting ti show on my face. Help with wrinkles and fine lines is much needed. Right away, I could feel my face starting to firm up when I put this on before bed. I could see the difference when I woke up and looked in the mirror. This will be going into my regular beauty regime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream goes on so smoothly and smells wonderful. It has been easy on my, at times, temperamental skin. It doesn't feel greasy or sticky. Not too heavy like some other creams. L'Oreal got it right with this night cream. I look forward each night to putting it on. I haven't seen substantial changes in the firmness of my skin but I am loving the hydration! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great product. My skin feels softer and firmer in the morning when I use the night cream. I have used other firming night cremes but none of them provide the good results that RevitalLift does. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been looking for a good night cream for a while. A lot of them are too greasy or heavy for me. This cream really absorbs quickly. It is not heavy and does not cause me to break out. There is not a greasy texture either so I don't have to worry about feeling like it is settling on top of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have sensitive skin and this has never irritated my face. RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream really does keep my face moisturized well into the next morning. I's a thicker cream, yet goes on smooth. It has a light, simple scent. My skin looks so refreshed in the morning, so I am not sure what kind of magic it works overnight, but it definitely gives me a more youthful appearance! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I have been using the L'Oréal products for a couple of weeks now and I am in love with the product. The night cream is easy to apply and non greasy so it doesn't get all over my pillow if I lay down after. I feel a better glow on my face and a few of my wrinkles have gone away. I am sold on the product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think you will be very satisfied with this product! I have used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream for a few weeks now and I love the way my skin looks and feels when I wake up in the morning. I recommend that you do put it on about 20-30 minutes before going to bed because it is a thicker moisturizer but not to worry about it rubbing off onto your bed sheets or pillow. It soaks into your skin very nicely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love This night cream. It's thicker than most night moisturizer is that I own. It's non-greasy and rubs in with ease . Does not have a strong scent. This is the first night cream that I have been able to use nightly . It's the first one that I've wanted to use because results are starting to show . I use it along with the day cream and eye cream . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I dud like that the jar was blue as to make sure it wasn't one of the other products. marked lids of neck and day creams as not to confuse. I thought it was thick out of jar however it went on smooth and absorbed rather quickly. then going to bed did notice very smooth in morning. I like using one regiment of products as I feel it compliments one another. I will not be buying this in the future. I liked what I've currently been using and return to it.

"This Loreal Revitalift night cream is amazing! I love the consistency of it, thick and creamy. It spreads on my skin quite nicely! This is just what I needed to perk up my ""40-something"" skin. I've been using this cream every night for a few weeks now and I can certainly tell a difference. I will definitely recommend this product to my friends, family and coworkers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for about a week now so I can't say if it's working yet. But the cream goes on easily which is good. When I wake up, there is a slight film left on my face, but it's not too thick. It feels like it is kind of working because of the film left. Good cream. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is so great! It's light, but covering cream is working on my skin! I tend to be a sensitive skin kind of gal, but this L'Oreal firming night cream is soft scented and really goes on smoothly. After 9 days, I can really see a difference and yesterday, one of my sisters complimented me on glowing! Love it!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It works wonderfully however when I put it on at night I wake up with leathery skin. Luckily I can just wash it off its just a strange feeling first thing in the morning. Of course I'm still using it every night :). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the Revitalift Night cream for 2 weeks faithfully now. I LOVE this cream!! It is not heavily scented and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy at all. The cream absorbs into my skin leaving it super soft and smooth. I am starting to notice a difference in my fine lines, especially around the eyes. It comes in a large jar so it will last a long time. This is a great addition to my skin care routine. I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Great texture and scent... Need very little for spreadability. I love this stuff and I feel privileged to try this! I have excessive dry skin and this helps me a lot after my night shower and doesn't leave a greasy sensation while I'm in bed. I would buy this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I can't believe how well this product works. Put it on before going to bed and my skin is so much better in the morning. Definitely going to continue to use this product. It lives up to its promises. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream. I have been using this cream for a few weeks now and it has made my skin softer and I can see a difference in the areas I have fine lines. It has added more elasticity to my skin and has reduced the visibility of the lines. It goes on smooth and has a great lasting fragrance, that doesn't upset my senses like other night creams do. I am a huge fan of this product and I look forward to the results by the time I finish the jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this product a lot, it felt really good when I put it on at night, thick and creamy. I don't know if any wrinkles are disappearing, but just applying it to my face was a nice experience. I also liked the packaging, the container was heavy and substantial and the midnight blue color very attractive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a wonderful product. Thick and creamy yet absorbs quickly so you are left with a soft and slightly dewy feel. A great way to end your day and send you off to sleep. This is my new go to night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I sampled the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Night Cream and was disappointed. The fragrance was stronger than all the other products. The scent was not unpleasant but just very over-powering. The night cream was also very heavy and not very comfortable to wear all night. I found it was causing my face to break out in my t-zone the next morning. I would have liked something lighter to soften my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love the results i get from the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream. Now if i could just remember to do this every night. How nice is it that you can firm & moisturize while you are sleeping? The cream is very light and doesnt leave a sticky feeling and you dont have to worry about it rubbing off on your pillow. It does absorb very quickly. A barely there scent means you can drift off to sleep and not have to worry about a heavy scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This night cream is thick and goes on smooth. For those of you that are sensitive to strong smells this is the cream for you! It does not have a strong scent it is light, creamy and smells wonderful! You don't need a lot as a little goes a long way and it makes my skin feel firmer and hydrated when I wake up. I didn't notice any difference in wrinkles but, my skin feels much firmer. I would recommend this product and I will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've never used a night cream before - so this was a bit new. I felt like the night cream did a good job of moisturizing throughout the night so my skin felt soft and supple the next morning. I'd recommend this product to others! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this every night and have notice a difference in my skin in a weeks time. The cream just absorbs into the skin like a sponge. Goes on smooth and silky and smells good. By morning my skin glows and no dry skin and wrinkles seem to be a lot less in just a week. I would definately buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I didn't use it the recommended 4 weeks so I can't really judge the anti wrinkle and firming capabilities. Plus, i do have very few wrinkles to begin with so I am not sure how well it did in that area anyhow. I can say it left my skin feeling soft and it moisturizes well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream is thicker and a little goes a long way. It absorbs easily into the skin. There is a slight fragrance and even though I prefer fragrance free creams, it's not too overpowering. My skin is usually dry but this cream keeps it moisturized and soft. It also plumps up my face and my wrinkles are less noticeable. My skin is in better shape. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely LOVE the RevitaLift firming eye cream! Just days into it, I felt and saw smoother and lighter skin under my eyes....now that it's been weeks, the skin is so firm AND I don't even remember what dark circles are supposed to look like. Out of all the RevitaLift products Bzzagent and L'Oréal had me try, this one is my absolute favorite!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the night cream for three weeks and my skin feels and looks firmer. However, the cream is very thick and leaves a greasy film on my skin. I have adjusted the amount I use multiple times and I still have the same issue. Most nights I end up having to wipe the excess off. Though it is a bit heavy for my skin I am overall satisfied with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. The factor that it was firming and moisturized my skin while I was asleep, and then when I woke up I felt refreshed. The cream was a very smooth consistency and did not leave my face feeling greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i have never used a night cream before, since my skin tends to break out at will...i was really worried at first that this would could his in spades. To my surprise it didn't...it just moisturized!! It was kinda awesome. The scent is nice too, not too strong or overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this cream I wake with my skin feeling like it has a glow in the morning. I would say be careful with this cream. It is thicker and if you use too much it will definitely make your skin feel oily and greasy. It has a weird scent but not irritating. I'm not sure of its benefits yet but it helps keep my skin moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had been looking for a good night cream, most I have tried left me feeling let down, that was not the case with this L'Oréal night cream. It felt so nice on my skin, never sticky and dried quickly, pleasant light scent was a huge plus as well. I have used this product for almost two weeks and I can see mild results, my skin just feels fresher, firmer, and better, Fine lines are now less visible, and smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I actually really like the L'oreal firming night cream. First of all, I have been awful about my night time skin routine and I feel that this made me want to wash the day off my face before I went to bed. I loved the smell especially and I did feel that my skin felt firmer upon waking. Way to go L'oreal!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried all of the cremes for several days hoping for great results since it is L'Oréal But I seem to be allergic because from day 1 my sinuses and eyes were affected. It started slowly but the last day I used it I was totally watery eyes and nasal problems. I was afraid to go another day. After I stopped all symptoms disappeared quickly [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am new to anti-wrinkle product and I rarely apply moisturizer at night. But after trying L'Oréal anti-wrinkle night cream I am hooked! I really like the feeling of the cream. It is light, smooth and actually feels soothing. I apply it right before I go to bed. When I wake up I think my skin doesn't look as tired as it used to. I believe I will continue using this product, especially during winter since the air is so dry where I live. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream makes my skin feel but I've been using it a month and can't tell that much of a difference. Like I said, I do live the way it makes my skin feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream goes on nicely and I love the color of the packaging. I'm not in love with Products on jara, because the cream can get under your nails. I would use this product more but after using it o had some blemishes which I typically do not get even though I moisturizer daily. The product is a good name for a great price but it's not the best fit for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was a great product. I wasn't 100% sold at first, the first week I wasn't feeling it but once I got to the second week I could see a difference. I mean I'm only in my early 30 and I only have a few trouble spots but on the second week those spots were pretty much gone. I'm always looking for a night cream that isn't super thick and blends in really well, I hate the feeling of going to bed with super thick cream on my face. You're never to you to start preventing wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed using the product. I have been using it as well as 3 others for 3 weeks and all of them seem to work as advertised. I have seen visible improvement and plan to continue the regimen after the samples are gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use this product with L'Oreal Revitalift Firming Eye Cream every night before bed time. Although I have only been using these products less than four weeks, I have already noticed that my skin feels smoother and healthier. It is non-greasy and is easy to apply. The scent is not overpowering so no issue for me. Based on the results so far, I would definitely recommend this product and I will also be buying this product and keeping it in my nightly facial ritual. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle creams. I have been using these day and night treatments for a while now and I can honestly say, I feel like my skin is nicer now than when I was much younger. My skin is soft, smooth and feels tighter. My husband even has complimented me on how nice it feels. This will be my go to face treatment from now on.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is the best product on the market for night cream. Ive tried so many and each one failed to impress. I used this night cream for 2 weeks and I can really tell a difference when I wake up. My skin doesnt look tired like it did, I look more refreshed. I highly recommend this cream, its overnight magic. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a pretty decent product. It was easy to apply, smells good and isn't oily after application. I don't really see a decrease in fine lines yet, but it's only been about 3 weeks. My skin definitely feels and looks better, though. You don't really need to know anything before trying this product. I have pretty sensitive skin and I didn't have any problems. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love the night cream. It feels like it is literally firming the face. Very tingling feeling when you put it on . Other creams that I have tried doesn't compare to this product . Very happy with the results . Thanks for letting me try this product . I look forward to trying more products . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the way this cream makes my face feel. After overnight I feel refreshed. I was skeptical but I really feel a difference in the texture of my skin. I look forward to using each night after a long day. I know that I will continue to use this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's been over a week now. Initially I did not like the texture of the cream, felt more like a hand cream but I'm starting to like how light it feels on my skin. My skin is combination and a little bit on sensitive side. My skin didn't break out and my skin felt fresh and moisturized when I wake up in the morning. I also used eye cream under my eyes and my eye bags were gone (yay). Over all, it's a nice product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream as part of my nightly beauty routine to be effortless, which is definitely a plus after a long, busy, exhausting day. I enjoy knowing I'm doing something quickly to help reduce the appearances of fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the L'Oréal Paris RevitaLift Anti-wrinkle firming night cream for about three weeks. I love the way my face feels when I wake up. I have less wrinkles and my skin is firmer. The smell of the cream isn't my favorite but it's not horrible. My skin has a better overall appearance as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed the texture of this Non-greasy nighttime moisturizer... i'm used to a night cream that is so thick, I sometimes overuse it, but this spread evenly and was generous in its moisturizing properties with out using up a ton of product. Smoothed and firmed my pores, but no noticeable difference with my single wrinkle in between my brows (probably from scowling o_o !!) I would purchase this again as an alternative to more expensive night creams. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The anti wrinkle and firming night cream certainly is an awesome moisturizer and I absolutely love that feature of this product, but I am not completely sure I can deal with the strange fragrance this cream has. I don't mind if my evening moisturizers have a slight fragrance, but this one definitely is not appealing to me and that would be a reason I would discontinue to use it even though I really like the quality of the cream itself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using L'Oreal RevitaLift Night Cream for the last month. I see real improvement in my skin texture and softness. The combination of Night Cream with the L'Oreal RevitaLift Eye Cream has made some real improvements in the areas around my eyes. My ""laugh lines"" are disappearing and I see a lot of improvement in the puffiness around my eyes in the morning. Even my husband noticed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the night cream for about 2 weeks and even tho I don't see any ""firming"" in my skin or fine lines it does leave my skin really hydrated and healthy looking in the morning. I'll keep using it to see what the results are after using the whole bottle. I do wish it came with a little spatula or a pump to make life easier but it's not that big of a problem because the jar is pretty big [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is okay. I have used it for a few weeks, and really haven't noticed a difference. I love the way it smells and it does keep my face hydrated, especially with the cold weather settling in. I will continue to use the product, to get the results I want. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for several weeks and love it. I use it every night before I go to bed and in the morning I can really feel that my skin is becoming softer and smoother. I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this is a quality product but not for me. I found the night cream to be rather heavy and greasy for my complexion. I have very oily skin and am prone to break outs and this cream didn't help. The ingredients listed are of quality and the packaging is very nice but again it was not for me. I think I will research the Loreal line to find a lighter version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I honestly love this! It has a light fragrance that I like and it is not greasy. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. I wake up in the morning to soft and smooth skin. I have oily skin, so My face is a bit shiny in the morning but not much, so I can't complain becuase of all the other benefits that I am getting as well. So far of using this, I haven't noticed any thing else. But I will continue using it and maybe I will come up to other changes in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have never used a night cream before so I was excited to try this. It goes on thick but not sticky, if that makes sense. You feel that you are getting a lot of deep nourishment. Once it smooths on, it absorbs quickly and does not have a greasy feel. It's getting colder out and I've noticed my skin drying out more. I can't wait to try this over the winter months and see how it works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVED my new RevitaLife Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream. It's so smooth and creamy and seems to work nicely. I've been using it for about two weeks now and I can feel the difference in my face already. I don't have many wrinkles as it is but I can feel that my face is smoother and looks brighter. I'm 30 and I feel like my skin looks like it's 20 again, hehe. I would definitely recommend this to other women my age. I feel like it's definitely worth the money. Give it a try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my absolute favorite night cream. It has a great texture, light, smells wonderful and is very hydrating. I have been using it for almost a month and my skins is so soft and no longer dry and irritated from the weather changes. This is definitely going to be in my nightly skin care routine from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had been looking for a nighttime lotion for my face and I definitely found it! This cream worked great and in the few weeks since I've been using it I can really see results, especially in my forehead. The only thing that I would change is the smell, it has a bit too much perfume but nothing I didn't get used to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've always hated night creams - they make me feel like I'm sticking to my pillow. And I'm not fond of scented lotions at all. L'Oreal RevitaLift Night Cream wasn't sticky or stinky. I apply it nightly after washing my face, and I don't even notice it's there for the rest of the evening. I have a couple of dry patches on my face that didn't seem to go away with my previous lotions. I'm planning to keep using this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I felt a burning sensation on my face when I applied around my eyes. It also smelled overly floral and unnecessarily scented. All moisturizers for the face should have NO SCENT AND MINIMAL INGREDIENTS. I would never buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the Firming Night Cream is heavy. It is kind of oily when it is on my skin. It clogged my pores and caused me to break out. It did help reduce fine line and wrinkles and firm the skin, however it caused me to have acne all over my face. I didn't think it wanted me to have teenage skin with breakouts again. it was kind of embarressing. Not sure I would purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle and Firming Night Cream is one of the best products I've ever tried. Most night creams go on greasy but this formula goes on easy, smooth and dries quickly. No greasy residue left over which can sometimes cause outbreaks. It does have a slight scent but nothing overpowering or too strong. It's a light clean/fresh scent. I would recommend to anyone looking for a fairly easy, affordable option for a night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my favorite cream all you do is put it on and go to bed wake up and in a few days start to notice how much softer, firmer with less wrinkles your face looks. It's not a miracle worker but I have noticed changes faster than with other products I have used. I tend to give up after a while if I don't see any but I didn't have that problem with this product. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the night cream on a daily basis and I have noticed a difference in the moisture in my skin, I do not wake up with a dry feel. The cream is thick and rich, not greasy at all, pleasant scent.I use the cream on my face, neck and the skin between my breasts. I have awful wrinkles there from sun damage and I feel like the wrinkles are less noticeable now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Putting on the Revitalift Anti wrinkle firming night cream is my favorite part of my night routine. Waking up after wearing it, makes my eyes feel so fresh and wonderful, and its almost like I can feel the wrinkles melting away [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this cream. I feel as though it's a spa like experience. At the end of the night to run in this cream on my neck and face the smooth sensation on the skin the light fragrance, and a light touch is very relaxing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This lotion is a bit on the thick side, which feels a tad heavy for me. Used every night it does leave my skin feeling very hydrated.. so much so that I began using it every other night. My skin appears healthy, and bright with frequent use. Has a light flowery scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This lotion is lightweight and I found that a little bit goes a long way. SPF 18 makes this good for daily sun protection, but it does leave my face just a little bit sticky. I layered powdered mineral makeup over the lotion most days, and it went on smoothly. Over time there may be a noticeable 'lift' effect, but in the meantime I'm enjoying the glow it gives. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unfortunately I would not recommend this product. I found it much too thick for me. My skin felt hydrated but it is too heavy for nightly use. I may consider it for a few times a week, but not as a daily part of my skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the way my skin is looking after on using this product for a couple of weeks. My face is looking smoother and firmer. I like that it has a good scent and os not greasy. Also, a little go a long way!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this cream, is quickly absorbed into my skin. I use every night after clean my face and neck. I pretty love the results, and course love the blue package, is so pretty. The most important thing is that containg Pro-Retinol and rejuvenates skin overnight. I see my skin more smoother and firmer after a couple of weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the night cream it goes on smooth and doesn't weigh down your skin. I can really tell a difference in my skin I use it every night and my wrinkles are starting to not look so deep. I would totally recommend this product to anyone that is looking a wrinkle cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have always had an issue with dryness around my eyebrows and in the corners of my nose. The flakiness was embarrassing. After using the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream every night, I have not have that problem. My skin is soft smooth and there is no more flakiness anywhere. I also use it on my hands which has really made a big difference in the way they look, much younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had never tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Night Cream. There are so many different brands out there with so many promises. I am very pleased with how much moisture this cream has added to my skin. My skin had been feeling rather dry lately & I wanted to try a new moisturizer. I do believe it has helped my skin for the better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wow! Was I ever wrong!! I have been using a night cream, nothing fancy, just your average run of the mill night cream. Ya know, to keep the wrinkles to a dull roar. But after using this L'Oréal cream.... wow, what a difference! Smells good! Smoother skin. I can really tell a difference in this cream compared to what the stuff I was using. I can have sensitive skin and this didn't seem to have anything but good reaction with my skin!! 2 thumbs up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the night cream. It makes more sense to me than thee day time creams because there is only one to deal with instead of the 2 used during the day. It does go on smooth and isn't greasy or oily which is great. My skin does seem to be well moisturized when I wake up which is nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the night cream for a couple weeks now and like the thick texture on application. Especially since it is getting colder and my skin needs more moisture. Have not noticed any noticeable changes to my skin (i.e. less wrinkles) except for the adequate moisture it is getting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved the night cream, tried it every night for a week straight. Felt great, went on smooth and not ""cakey"". Starting to notice a difference in the lines around my nose , eyes and mouth. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've never been one who puts cream on at night before bed, but I have made it a habit to apply the night cream before I go to bed. I'm am pleased to say, I enjoy looking at myself in the mirror in the morning. My skin does look fresher now than it has in the past. I will keep using the night cream as my nightly routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream contains Pro-Retinol which is an anti-wrinkle ingredient and Stimuplex which helps firming the skin. I used this product for 2 weeks and I can see some improvements in my skin appearance. It is firmer and brighter. The only problem I encountered at first was the strong smell, but I got used to it and it doesn't bother me anymore. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how moisturized my face feels when I wake up!! Some night time creams are to thick and clog my pores but the Revitalift night time cream is amazing. I feel refreshed and moisturized instead of my face feeling heavy!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have sensitive skin, and it did not irritate it all! I will be buying more! I highly, highly recommend trying this product if you haven't already! Happy costumer!

Love to put this cream on at night before I go to bed. I think this cream has made my face smoother and firmer since I have started using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream. Love the way it goes on my face. Not greasy or clumpy. The smell is wonderful. My daughter told me I looked rejuvenated in the mornings. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Revitalift Anti-wrinkle and firming eye cream.I have used this product for about 4 weeks. I do have dark circles and wrinkles under the eye. The Negative side was it did in fact burn my eyes for a good 10 minutes.I don't think it lightens the darkness . I do apply day and night.Have not noticed any firming nor a huge improvement in wrinkles. The jar itself is very small. Is a bit heavy until it soaks in.This is just my opinion, probably won't purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream (1.7 oz) for a couple of weeks now. I use it every night and I can see the results. After about a week I started to notice a difference and now after two weeks the results are even better. I wasn't expecting it to work this well but I a really pleased with it. I would definitely recommend this product to help with wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the night creme. It isn't too heavy and it absorbs right away. When I wake up in the morning my face is still smooth and nourished, unlike before I started using it. It only takes a small amount of the cream to get full coverage, so I know this will last me for a while. This is a good buy in my book. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle and Firming Night Cream.The Cream itself is very thick which is good as it absorbs throughout the night.Seems to work okay.However, my face as well as my neck seems firmer and softer.I do like when I wake up my face feels well moisturized and hydrated. My neck feels a little tighter.I feel Refresed.Very Satisfied [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I've been using the eye cream for a couple weeks now and I love it! It's a little thicker than the day cream but goes on just as well without making your skin feel oily. I like how I don't have to use a lot of it and it absorbs into the skin nicely. My skin feels so much softer since I've been using these products. I can't attest to the firming of the skin yet but I can't wait to see what continued use will do. I definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Despite it being a drugstore brand, this night cream is amazing!!!! I apply it at night and when I wake up, my skin is glowing and firmer and just younger looking!!!! I haven't had any breakouts (despite being acne prone) or allergies. And I'm just amazed at how well this works!!! You have to try this!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I gave this a couple of weeks to see if I could see a differnce. I really love the results it gave me the next morning after I put on the cream at night. It gave me a more youthful look in the morning which I was very surprised. I recommend the L'Oreal night cream I've tried other brands and I've never had this result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream for several weeks and love the results. My skin felt smoother and my husband noticed that it looked softer and younger. As a mom, it is hard to take the time out to care for myself and you seem to age quicker. Using this takes a few minutes at night and allows me to achieve that younger look without all the harsh chemicals, dangerous surgeries, or a lot of time.

"I love this cream! It feels so great going on--so smooth! It makes your skin feel beautiful and silky and ready to slip into bed. I love the light fragrance too, as it's not the least bit strong! Can't wait to see how it keeps my wrinkles at bay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this product and it was not worth the hassle or the lack of results. I had to stop using it after just two weeks because it left my skin feeling greasy and it affected my eyes when my face got wet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Have been wearing the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream for several days now. It took a bit to get into the habit of putting it on before bed. But once, I got into the habit, it became second nature. I could see a difference in just a couple of days. My face looks firmer and smoother in just a week. I can't wait to see the improvement after 28 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream is amazing. It's a light non-greasy formula that keeps your skin moisturized all through the night. My skin feels amazing and wonderful. These past couple of weeks have been amazing! When your skin looks good, you look good! Moisturizing at night is a must! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It seems to work as well as anything else I have ever used for keeping the wrinkles at bay and helping my skin look revitalized. Of course nothing can beat a good nights sleep and plenty of water, but I am happy with this product and will keep buying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I haven't noticed any difference in wrinkles but boy oh boy does my skin feel so firm and supple in the morning. My makeup glides on so much smoother in the morning and my skin feels very hydrated. This is also a great consistency to use on your neck and chest as well!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can definitely see a difference with using all the products. The night cream seems much lighter than the day cream, but it still goes on smoothly and is not irritating. Also I have not suffered any breakouts, which can normally happen when I use creams. My face seems tighter and brighter since using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream. I like that my skin feels soft and that the winter dryness is not there this year! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I feel that I finally have results starting from the L'Oreal Firming Night Cream. I gave it a few weeks before writing a review. At first, I really saw nothing changed. However, this morning while putting on my makeup, I actually notices smoother skin. Not so much wrinkles gone, but a nice look to my facial skin. I am pleased. I do believe there is change. I am happy to keep using it. I would go out and buy it after it is used.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

L'Oréal RevitaLift night cream has been my nightly routine. Been using it for over three weeks now and I can see the difference. My skin feels firm and soft. The cream is my too thick and gets easily absorbed. My skin is not dry anymore. It stays moisturizer all night and feel refreshed in the morning. I have a very sensitive skin and usually get hives each time I use lotions on my face. But this one hasn't made my skin break out. Loving it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love how it feels after a long day. Can immediately feel a difference in the dryness of my skin. Would highly recommend following it up in the morning with the corresponding day cream. It's made a tremendous difference in just a few weeks. I feel like I look less tired, despite a much busier schedule! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the L'Oreal Revitalift anti-wrinkle and firming night cream for about 3 1/2 weeks. I like the scent of the cream and the thickness of the cream without feeling heavy. I like the feel of my skin and looks younger and firmer and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the firming night cream as a part of my regimen. Washed my face, then applied the cream. It is very rich and thick. But to my surprise not heavy feeling or greasy. It glides on smoothly and the moisture absorbs into the skin quickly. I love the light scent. I woke up with my face looking beautiful and radiant.My face feels firm and smooth. Thank you L'Oréal Paris [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think I will absolutely buy another one of these when I am finished with this one. My husband and I both use this, most nights, before bed. It makes my skin feel so hydrated and soft. I would like it to smell a little better-maybe a fruit or flowery scent? That is my only complaint! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First impression, smells so good! The product is thick and if you rub it in well, it won't leave your face greasy. When u woke up the next day, I do feel like my hair was greasier then usual around my forehead. Other then that, it's a fun product to use and I'm excited to see the results after longer usage.

"I am currently using Loreal Revitalift Anti Wrinkle and Firming Night Cream. Using this product has me excited for the effect on my skin. Not only do I see a difference but others do too. It lie not greasy feeling or ""heavy feeling"" on my face. I have been using this in conjunction with Loreal Anti Wrinkle and Firming Day Cream and also the face and neck cream.

"I wasn't a big fan of this product. I did like the smell of this product and like how smooth it goes on your face. I did not like the greasy feeling on your skin and waking up with a greasy face. Might not be the right product for my skin type? Not sure, but will not be using again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how this doesn't feel greasy like a lot of night creams. I THINK I can tell the difference in how it looks....but how it feels I KNOW I can tell a difference. Being 40 doesn't mean you have to look it any longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream is working well for me. It is a nice thick cream, no unpleasant scent, and very easy to incorporate into my pre-bedtime routine. After using a couple of weeks I can say my skin feels softer, healthier, and more hydrated. This time of year I typically get flaking/dry skin, but this product line seems to be preventing that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the night cream is amazing. I use it after I get out of the bath. This cream is a lot thicker than the rest, and It's still rich and creamy. I really like the smell of it. It's not over powering. I dont think it's greasy at all. It does take about 5 minutes for it to seep in and fully dry. I love the results I'm seeing. My face is hydrated and looks brighter and younger-ish looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this product. I was super happy to try this sample. I have very sensitive and dry skin and was looking for a new lotion or potion. My skin is super soft and feels amazing after only about 2 weeks of use. No reaction or anything. It goes on light and smells amazing. I love how it's not greasy or heavy. I'll definitely consider purchasing this when my sample runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Going into this I've never used a night cream nor do I think I need a firming or anti-wrinkle cream. Although I work outside and I'm 32, my skin has held up well. With that being said I loved the moisture the cream added to my skin over night. I also used the eye cream at night. I didn't see a lot of change but again I didn't feel like I needed this cream....but I do love it so I'll continue to use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I feel like this product gave my skin a softness, I applied it to my freshly washed face before going to bed and upon waking every time that I used it, it seemed to give my skin a soft smooth feeling. I really like this night cream . This in my opinion is a good product to use. I like the line of L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming products and I think if used all together your skin will reap great benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tested the night cream for almost two weeks and the result is almost the same as two weeks ago. It does moisturize as advertised and makes your skin smoother but it may take longer time to see better result. Having the cream in a glass jar is always a bonus point. Little amount of the cream does it jobs and this would last a long time. Use as directed and you may see better result in 4 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"OK you guys, I am convinced! I have used the L'Oréal Recitalist Anti-Wrinkle and Firming Cream for the past 21 days. I will continue to use this product because I have noticed that my face is smoothed and glowing when I wake up. I look rested and my skin looks beautiful. This gives me great confidence and it has only been 21 days. I am over 50, and L'Oréal is my skin cream of choice for lovely radiant skin. Thank you L'Oréal!

This night cream made my skin terribly dry and I have oily skin! I used all 4 products from this line and started deducting products until I figured out that this one was the culprit. It made my chin and below my lower lip dry and flaky. Luckily after a couple days of non-use my skin went back to its usual ways. I don't know what the ingredient is that would be causing oily skin to do this but it was not fun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle and firming night cream! The cream is not like others, there is no greasy feel, and it doesn't feel as if you put lotion on your face. The cream left my face feeling smooth and clean with a pleasant smell. Some creams leave your face with a tight feeling but not L'Oreal's, I can already tell a difference. I highly recommend trying this cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream and I felt like it was very moisturizing to my skin overnight. I did not however like the perfumed scent. The scent of the overnight cream was too strong and hurt my eyes when I would apply it. It does absorb well into my skin and was not too greasy to wear at night. I have not continued using this product due to the scent being too strong for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have never used a night cream till this one but i love it. This cream made my face feel so soft and hydrated and supple. It sinks in to the skin and best of all it dose not leave me feeling oily. I just dont like the smell but it is a light smell so i can get over that and will buy this once i am done with the jar that i have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love putting the night cream on after washing my face at night. Using all the products during the day & then the night cream seemed to make my skin ""glow"". Didn't notice a difference in wrinkles but may be cause I've only used to about 2 weeks. Helped with dry skin & didn't irritate my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the eye cream every single morning and every single evening, and I have seen quite a difference. At first, I used quite a bit as it soaked in thoroughly. As my skin got used to it, I put on less and less, and now I just put a little bit on my ring finger and tap it in around my eyes, and they look and feel fabulous! I love this L'Oreal anti wrinkle and firming eye cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used the night cream every evening as a routine before I go to bed.I have noticed that after I put the cream,it doesn't give me the comfort .Its not enough hydrated for my skin.Than I've tried to follow with the L'Oréal Revitalift face and neck and works for me perfect.When I get up in a morning I feel my skin very soft and healthy.No wrinkles at all .Very happy with the look.

"I was incredibly excited to try this product. The first week went great, however in the end week I started itching everything I used the product and had to discontinued using it. I am very disappointed, because I really wanted to see how well this worked. I will say during the first week, my skin felt great and the jar is a good size [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am giving this product 3 stars as it seems to be a good product (pleasant smell and not greasy-feeling), but unfortunately I was unable to continue use after a few days as this was not a good fit for my ultra-sensitive skin. As someone that suffers from cystic acne, this cream along with the facial day cream caused breakouts on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Out of all the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle products I've tried thus far, the Firming Night Cream is definitely my favorite. It has a denser feel to the cream than the Day Cream SPF 18 does. Its more dense and much more silky in texture. It makes my skin feel really soft immediately after putting it on. The smell of this cream is not over powering at all and I wake up with very supple skin, like it really worked overnight. Its a great product, it definitely does what it says. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product. I thought seemed a little thick at first, and thought it might be greasy and cause break-outs. It was the opposite. It was non-greasy and did not make my face ""stick' to my pillow and hair as I've experienced with other creams in the past. I used it in conjunction with the face and neck cream and the eye cream. I woke in the AM with a refreshed and moisturized face. I would highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I thought the loreal revitalift night cream was excellent. I felt my skin getting smoother and firmer after a few nights of using it. It is a good product that gets my desired result which is smoother and firmer skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Night Cream I really liked. It feels good to the skin when applied, left my skin feeling fresh and not greasy at all. My face looked brighter and firmer in the morning. Definitely a good night time product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was very comfortable to put on at night. It was not too heavy or greasy. My friend, Marleen, tried it too and she also liked it too. I have not see much change in my face or neck, in regards to decreasing wrinkles and skin changes but it seemed like a nice nighttime moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I typically only apply lotion to my face at night when it feels dry, however, the firming night cream will likely become part of my nightly routine from now on. I wake up with my face feeling refreshed, smooth and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really have to be honest... I only used this for about 3 days. First of all, I'm only 30, so while I AM starting to notice a few fine lines, I'm not completely over-the-top about them yet. Also, I have horribly oily skin, and I'm constantly battling acne. I found that this lotion just egged it on. I know it isn't supposed to, but with my angry skin it's just not right for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this firming cream with no real expectation that it would work. Within a week I could start to feel the difference. And it felt good!! I'm sure the longer I use this product the better the results too... which excites me. Most definitely found a new nighttime ritual. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have had the jar of L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream (1.7 oz) for a little over a week. I'm not used to applying cream to my face at night. I thought it would be a chore. It wasn't. The cream is smooth and light. It smells nice too. There was no residue on my pillow case, and the dry sections on my face feel lovely now. Thank you for allowing me to try this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Again, this made my face and neck feel quite oily and my daughter felt the same way. It is not something we would buy for ourselves but would recommend for anyone looking for a cream that does smooth their skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Since receiving these L'ORÉAL products to try, one week ago I have used them every day. The night cream I apply every night before bed after cleansing my face. It has a nice smooth feel to it. It's non greasy, not tacky at all. There is no unwanted smell. I feel this cream will help my skin on the long run. It will just take more than one week. I love all L'ORÉAL products, creams and make up. This one just proves to me once again they make a quality product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The RevitaLift Firming Night Cream is very light and easy to apply. I don't care for heavy creams and will stop using them within a few days. I have used this cream for two weeks and I have noticed that my skin looks much brighter when I get up in the morning. The small wrinkles around my eyes seem to be less noticeable too. I'm also pleased that it does not have a noticeable scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While it tended to be a tad greasy for ME, I felt it truly smoothed my skin nicely. I however had a small reaction of bumps in the morning. Other than that, super smooth, and not harsh/burning feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product religiously for the last 2 weeks and I'm very impressed with its ability to moisturize all night long. I've used other high end products before in the past and this is pretty comparable. Not sure about the firming abilities but works great as a moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Until I received this product I thought that I was too young to use a night cream. After using this for a week my skin appears softer and my pores are less noticeable. I will continue to use this and hopefully I will pass as my kids siblings. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream for about two weeks. I have super dry skin, but somehow, this night cream made my face too oily. This caused me to break out- which is something I never have a problem with. I do want to mention that I sweat at night, so maybe the combination of the sweat and cream caused the problem. I'm not sure- but this product is definitely not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for two weeks now and it has easily become part of my nightly routine. I feel like this moisturizers my face well without making it feel greasy. I've enjoyed the smooth feeling it leaves on my face. Over time, I'm hoping it will help to firm up a few areas, but it's hard to tell if that is happening yet. I will continue using this product and update my review when I see more results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I look forward to getting ready for bed now! I am exhausted at the end of the day and boy does my skin show it! This RevitaLeft AntiWrinkle Firming night cream does wonders for making me feel refreshed before bed! The smell is nice and the feel is luxurious. I feel like I am spoiling myself. My skin is feeling softer and firmer only after a week of use. I highly recommend this product to anyone who needs a little extra attention given themselves! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The night cram feels luxurious. I love the consistency and smoothness on my skin. I awake in the morning with soft, smooth skin. I've only been using these products a week so I'm not noticing much in the way of additional firmness just yet. I have noticed a softening of wrinkles around my eyes. I'm definitely looking forward to continuing to use the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this night cream. I have been using it in conjunction with the day cream and I can tell a difference on my skin. My skin feels smoother and firmer and more hydrated. I have had a difficult time finding a night cream the really works for my skin and I have now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the feel of this cream and it rubs in and absorbs nicely. Haven't seen a lot of difference yet but is a great product and I will continue using with the knowledge that it will soon work wonders! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream was also good. It was kind of oily to me but since it goes on at night no big deal. The fragrance is a little heavier than the antiwrinkle day cream but not unpleasant. I think being used in conjunction with the other creams has made a big difference in my skin. I can see the difference. I gave it a 4 just because of thr oilyness [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
What what a difference I notice for a few weeks. I usually hate creams because they are too heavy and make me break out. I don't feel that way at all with this product. It feels light and a little goes a long way. I love how my skin feels and even looks better in the morning. It looks smooth and supple. I'm in love with this product and by far my favorite of all these items. Every night after my shower I put this on my face and neck. It feels great [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream soakes up into your skin with out the oily feeling that most creams offer. It has a really light smell. I can't really tell the difference yet but I will continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the night cream and all of the other products for over a week and I am noticing a slight difference. I do love how soft my skin is when I wake up in the morning. There is a noticeable difference and that intrigues me very much. I will continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a good moisurizer. I didn't have a chance to use it long enough to notice any firming, but I did notice it moisturizer my skin. I am not crazy about the smell, but I am pregnant and have super sensitive smell. Overall great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Creme with out any great expectations. I was greatly mistaken. I applied for 2 weeks, every night before bed and the difference was noticeable after about 4 days. At the end of my 2 weeks, even my girlfriends noticed a difference. It's definitely worth a try. I'm glad I did!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been looking for a descent night cream now that I am creeping up on 40. This one seems to be pretty good. A little bit goes a long way I have found. I'm not a huge fan of the smell of it but it isn't so strong that I would rate it lower for it. I have found it makes my skin less oily. Overall I think it is a good product. I have not been using it enough to see much improvement but I know it is good for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i love it,i am so impressed by these l'oreal products,and i know that i am supposed to try all 4 amazing amazing products that i have,but i am always worried about a reaction,so i try a little bit at a time i have to assume,that l'oreal must have done their research on what women want,because i love the way my skin feels,and it just is a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the night cream. It has a pleasant smell and feel to it. Leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth. Not much to say about wrinkle reduction or skin firming. I haven't been able to identify a change in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a good night cream that does what it says it is going to do. It isn't to thick and blends in easily. I did not notice any strong smell. I did not notice a reduction in my fine lines but didn't notice a more firm, plumper appearance. If the price is right, I would consider adding this to my skin care arsenal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What can I say? After trying them out for two weeks, I am a big fan of the RevitaLift line of creams! They all have a wonderfully light, refreshing scent. The Night Cream is non-greasy, non-comedogenic (which makes me feel good about putting this all over my face) and very moisturizing. In the morning, my skin looks more rejuvenated and feels soft. I am a low maintenance person, and applying this Night Cream is an easy but worthwhile addition to my routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this does a great job on firming and smoothing out the fine line around my eyes and face. Easy to apply and has a nice scent that is just right. The cream absorbs easily into the skin and does not leave a greasy film like some other creams can. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this product along with the Firming Facial Day Cream and am very pleased at the results I've attained in just two weeks. The cream absorbs quickly and is not greasy. I've seen a noticeable improvement in the appearance of fine wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After many years of too much sun it is important to nourish my skin and prevent further damage. This is a great night cream that I apply over my face, neck and decollete. I wake with dewy feeling skin but noticeable to me is my skin is not as dull, it appears to have more glow. I have dry skin and use to wake with flaking skin on my chin, but the addition of this night cream has lessened that just with 2 weeks of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the Revitalift night cream for serval week now and I just love the way it has tightened up the pores in my face and also gave my skin a much more firm feel to it.My skin also feels soft and smooth to the touch. Thanks L'oreal another great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this cream. Nice and thick but not oily. Smells GREAT. Super happy with the portion size. I've been using it for 2 weeks now and when I wake up, my skin feels so good. I have noticed my skin is a little more firm and I'm happy about that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that the L'Oréal Revita lift anti wrinkle cream is the best I got it to review and omg I'm in love with it,It does not leave your face greasy feeling and it's not heavy on your face,it's the best and I would definitely recommend it which I already have to family and friends [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this night cream is heaven 8n a jar. Luxurious feel of softness immediately after application. Smell is low and plesant. Absorbs quick and easy no greasy feel. My skin l9oks and feels radiant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"RevitaLift Night Cream really seem to do its job during the night. After applying the cream to my face and neck, my skin felt refreshed and cool. It was like I could actually feel the cream doing its job. In the morning my skin felt smooth and very moisturized. I liked the scent and the ease of applying this product. RevitaLift Night Cream will certainly be on my necessary to buy list for the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for two weeks now and I can really see results in my skin. It is a lot firmer and softer than before. It doesn't feel too heavy and it melts into my skin. I would really recommend using the day cream and night cream as your skincare routine. I think using them both is more effective than using just one or the other. I am excited to continue using these products and seeing more results in a couple more weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream is a great product for beautiful, soft skin. Have used it nightly for 3 weeks and my skin feels like a baby's. Didn't know before receiving this free product that I needed it. It is not greasy and has a subtle fragrance. Now I will not stop using it. At 74, I did not realize my skin could improve so much in such a sort time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I normally don't use night creams, so I can't compare the RevitaLift cream to others. However, I will say it is a pleasant experience, for the most part. To me, it smells nice and feels creamy. It does seem to take a long time to rub it in...may BECAUSE it is so creamy. I like it, I enjoy using it, and I hope to see results. Results? I really don't see any difference yet, but I will continue to use it until it's gone. If it shows even slight results, I will buy it...if not, I won't. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Out of all the creams I really like this one. SO far so good. I did not have a acne breakout from just using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream. I also placed it with my regular moisturizer. It left my face feeling smooth and non greasy non shiny. It has a nice creamy consistency. You do not have to gather a lot in your hand. Very pleased with the outcome especially on the sides on my face and chin area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the Loreal REVITALIFT Night Cream is a good product for my face and neck as I sleep. I have been using it for over two weeks and I can see some differences with fewer wrinkles on my forehead and lower check area. After cleaning my face before bedtime, I apply the moisturizer to my entire face and neck area. It smells nice and feels fresh and light on my skin. Will definitely continue to use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although I don't have any wrinkles , this product I find is a great product for skin moisturizing. I like the blue jar it comes in and the smell. I like that you can apply it to your face as a night moisturizer. I also think the price is a reasonable and affordable price . I also recommend this product as a night moisturizing Cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really love how nice this goes on. When I wake up in the morning it is still there and my face feels great. With just a mild scent, this is perfect for me. I will definitely buy this product. It makes my skin feel so soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using RevitaLift Ant-Wrinkle and Firming Night Cream for a little over 2 weeks. I can definitely tell a difference. Cream is not heavy nor is it oily. Since using this product I've noticed that my face isn't as puffy in the mornings. It is also a great moisturizer, I have extra dry skin everywhere on my face except my nose, its extra oily. This definitely does a good job of balancing my skin. I've also noticed a reduction in the puffiness under my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the night cream... It didn't feel heavy when applied which was a problem I had in the past. It also wasn't greasy which is something I am always on the lookout for. I have also had several people comment about how ""good"" and refreshed I've been looking and the only difference has been using this line is creams.

"I have really enjoyed using the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream. The consistency of the cream is extremely thick + luxurious. When I put it on at night, I know that it is giving my skin deep moisture. I've also been plesantly surprised by how non-greasy the cream is, especially give how thick it is. I definitely plan to continue using this night cream as part of my routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"If you have never use a night cream this is for you goes on easy,graseless.I have notice a change. In my face more tight less wrinkles.

Can see a difference at 67 you should be able to also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the entire face cream kit, and have seriously broken out in acne on my chin. I have not had a break out this bad in years. I love the feel and texture of my cheeks and forehead, but have discontinued use of the morning and night creams in my chin. I don't know if the breakout is a coincidence, or truely related to the creams, but I feel it must be related since it appeared within a week of starting to use the creams.

what i loved about the product was that it wasnt greasy and it only takes a little its goes on smooth and has a very light smell its not strong people can see the difference in your skin my children noticed the difference in my face and i felt really good about it because they said it was a good product and it sure do work using this product is the best thing i could have done i get alot of complements [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was hesitant to think this night cream would be something that I'd like but I have to say, I really like it. It is a little greasy so you definitely have to wear this before going to bed, but it's good to know that the cream is working while I sleep. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for about 2 weeks now. I really like it. It has a very light smell which is a plus for me. I feel like my skin is tightening after I put it on. Once I run out I will probably buy more. Better than anything I've previously used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am really enjoying using the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle+Firming Night Cream. It's easy to spread across my face and neck, soaking into my dry skin well so that I don't feel greasy. And unlike most night creams, the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle+Firming Night Cream does not leave a greasy mess on my pillow case. In the morning when I wash my face, my skin feels noticeably softer.

"Revitalift anti-wrinkle + firming night cream seems to actually allow my skin to breathe! I can't comment on how effective it will be since I just started using it, but I have high hopes that in 4 weeks I will see a difference in my face and neck! For now, I am happy about how it doesn't clog my pores and feels light instead of heavy like a lot of creams out there! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This will forever be a staple in my line of defense against wrinkles and fine lines! Paired with RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Facial Day Cream, RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream and RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream its a quad of products that actually really work. The non greasy formula is great for the skin, absorbs quickly and no harsh scents! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Out of the entire L'Oreal RevitaLift products that I tried, this one was my favorite. I put this on before bed every night. It seems to soak up better than the day cream so I don't wake up with skin that feels like I've been sweating all night. The texture and smell were fine, it went on smooth and I didn't have to wash my hands after applying, unlike after using other creams. I will continue to use this product every night! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the ideal of a night Cream, diligently working on my skin while I get my beauty rest! That's just what the L'Oreal RevitaLift Night Cream is like! I feel like every morning when I wake up my skin looks better than the night before. I enjoy putting it on. It feels like a luxurious, high quality product that's not tacky or sticky. It contains quality ingredients that have resulted in firmer looking skin for me. Would definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unless you have extremely dry skin or you are an alligator... I used the night cream along with using the day and neck cream during the day and the combination was very heavy. It lead to clogged pores and a greasy feeling, couldn't use it after just two days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have enjoyed using this night cream, it's a bit heavy and very thick, and the scent is powdery (I would have preferred unscented), but it seems to be helping to keep my face moisturized and it feels softer. I've only been using it for a couple weeks so I cannot attest to it's firming claims, I can say it's been working well and has not irritated my skin so far so I will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is wonderful. I am a 32 year old female. I have very sensitive skin and I did not break out or turn red at all. The night cream is very light weight and not heavy which I love. It absorbed quickly and didn't leave an oily feel. The smell was not overwhelming at all. I noticed my skin felt smoother after just a few days so that could be the ""firming"" part coming into play. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really been enjoying this night cream. It smells good...in the past I have stopped using other products simply because they smelled bad! This product goes on smoothly, and I am motivated to use it every night because it is pleasant all the way around. I will purchase this in the future, because I like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can't lie and say I've faithfully used the night cream every night, but have more nights than not. As with the other day creams and eye cream this goes on smooth and clean as well. I enjoy the way it feels after I've washed my face at night and put the L'Oreal night cream on. In a way, it makes my face feel even cleaner and somehow seems to relax me. I really like it a lot.

Every morning I have made it a point to look and feel my face to see how RevitaLifts anti-wrinkle and firming night cream is working . I must say I really see and feel the difference.

"I've only been using this product in the evenings for the last week and a half. I do like how it goes on very light unlike some other night creams that I have used, which usually feel like paste being applied to my face. Other that that I really have not noticed a difference in my skin tone with this product. I do have to say that it kept my face nice and moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product seems to be a little greasy on my skin. While I have enjoyed using the Revitalift products, I am undecided as to whether I like it or not. I feel like my skin has been more prone to breakouts while using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this product...My face feels firmer in the mornings and not so dry...Paired with your other L'Oreal Products and it's amazing...Not so noticeable wrinkles and look younger...I am extremely picky about what I use on my face...I break out easily but so far not with this product...I am sensitive to smells and this product doesn't have a strong smell at all...It helps with the dry area and does not leave a ""greasy look""...

"The RevitaLift night cream might be one of the best moisturizers I've used. It has a nice, thick texture and melts into skin. When I wake up in the morning, my face is soft and not greasy, which is great! The only downside to the cream is the very strong scent, which is on the verge of intolerable to my sensitive nose.

"Its makes your skin feel like velvet, the signs of aging are going bye bye!! My friends are jealous and I'm GLAD!!!...Products are full size as well.

"I have used other creams as part of my nightly skin care routine. None have given me the amazing results as L'Oreal's anti-wrinkle firming night cream has. In just 2 short weeks I have noticed my skin is more smooth and radiant. I have combination skin, so I was always afraid creams would make it more oily. Instead it evened out my skin. It's not heavy and absorbs well. A little goes a long way, so this is also very cost effective! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this product and it broke me out! I rarely get pimples usually, so I'm pretty sure it was this night cream. It is a really rich, thick cream, which is very moisturizing. The problem is it is not meant for skin like mine-extremely oily and acne-prone. This has retinol in it, but my skin couldn't tolerate this cream long enough to tell if the retinol works. I imagine it would be great for someone with dry, mature skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cream left a little bit of a tingley feeling after applying almost as if you can feel the firming working. It was followed by a little bit of a burn (could of been because of my face cleaner used prior). It left a perfect shine so I knew I had all areas of my face covered. My skin was still moisturized when I woke up this morning.Very moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that this is my favorite of the L'Oreal RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle creams. It is so silky and thick when it goes on that I always wake up with a refreshed and moisturized face. I would definitely recommend this product paired with the day cream with spf as part of routine, your face will thank you, especially with the dry winter months coming up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this night cream a lot, and my skin feels fabulous, both after using it and when I wake up. What's most noticeable is the softness of my skin. As night creams go, this one is pretty light. It doesn't feel thick, heavy, or greasy on my skin, either on my dry cheeks or oily T-zone. It doesn't aggravate my eczema, nor does it cause me any breakouts or irritation. I usually steer clear of night creams, but this one is a good fit for my problem skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love putting on the night cream. It glides on so smoothly. The scent is nice and soft but light. When I wake up my skin feels so soft and smooth. I have a few lines on my forehead. I'm noticing the lines slowly disappearing. I truly recommend you use it. You won't regret it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is a great product it does a wonderful job on my face and the best part is that it's working overnight while i sleep when i awake in the morning i feel amazing my face is smooth,soft, clean and left with a glow this product really does work i feel years younger now and im so happy i recommend that everyone give this product a try you wont regret it.

"I have never used night cream before, I guess I never thought it was important. It smells great and really goes on thick, but I woke up feeling very moisturized. I only just received this product so I haven't seen any benefits yet but will continue to use it to see if it makes a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream has made my skin appear smoother and softer. I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate it at all.

"A little skeptical at first because I've been using another product for several years, however I'm so completely satisfied with the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle +Firming Night Cream. It smells so good and I love the way my face feels after applying nightly. I wanted to give this product a try for a couple of weeks before giving my BZZ review. It's great and I have decided to make this a regular part of my facial routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is fantastic!! I have oily and dry skin. So it is a challenge to find a lotion that works with my skin type. You just use a small amount of the lotion which is great. When I get up in the mornings my face feels smooth and not to oily or to dry. Would recommend it to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think product is awsome. I have used other products that leaves my skin so oily in the morning. I only used it for a week but my skin feels firmer and look forward to using the entire jar. I am so glad to be able to try this firming neck cream. The first time I used it the smell was a real put off but once on I did not notice it. This lotion is for any skin type.

"Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream left my skin noticeably firmer and smoother - especially on my neck and forehead, where lines were beginning to develop. It went on my skin nicely and did not feel too thick or greasy. I will be using this nightly during the Winter months to help hydrate my dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream for over a week now and am pleasantly surprised with the results. At first the cream goes on a bit heavy but by morning my face has absorbed the cream and gives my skin a nice soft and moist feel. Unfortunately, as I am in my fifties with many wrinkles, it wasn't magic and didn't make mine disappear. But I plan to continue using and hope that it keeps me from getting more.

"I absolutely love this night cream. It has a thick texture that absorbs quickly and I feel it has restored necessary hydration giving me a smoother complexion. I have dry skin, more so in the fall and winter months and this cream is working amazing for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"For whatever reason, after I wash my face before I go to bed, my face feels really dry and tight. This cream makes it feel so much better and definitely moisturizes like a boss. Not sure how it is helping with wrinkles since I like to believe I don't have many, but it is a great night moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this nightly and the day cream in the morning. My face looks smooth. My Grandmother even commented on how flawless my complexion was. This is a thicker cream, but absorbs quickly. I experienced a little tingling upon first applying, but it was over momentarily. Overall I am loving how my face looks and feels. Hoping for even bigger results as I continue the routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like having a cream to moisturize my face at night. It smells good and is easy to apply after I remove all my make up. It soaks in right away and leaves my face feeling smooth. In the morning it's still smooth and ready to apply my make up all over again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can definitely see a difference in my face in the morning after using this night cream. My skin has a firmness and a glow to it. I have youthful skin and I am trying to let it remain that way so the anti wrinkle is a plus. I can also tell the mornings when I didn't use the product at night, my skin would be a little more dull. This cream is not heavy at all and you can't even tell that you just put a cream on your face. You don't need to use a lot because it is very moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like how this product made my skin feel less wrinkle and no sagging skin. I didn't have an issue with my skin being so sensitive. I will be adding it to my daily routine. Yes I woke up like this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this nightcream, it goes on nice and smooth, it's very hydrating and I can definately see a difference after using this every night before bed for over a week and my face looks so refreshed in the morning..I'm 37 so I'm not sure how this does with wrinkles? But any fine lines I was starting to form have softened..I'll definately be purchasing more of this when it runs out..my skin will thank me as I get older!!! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My face was feeling extremely dry, so I decided to try the Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream before bed. It has a very light texture, not greasy, with little scent. It was very gentle and soothing to the skin. Within minutes I noticed a huge change in my skin, it was hydrated, younger and firmer The results were even better the following morning. I would truly recommend this product to anyone interested in feeling and looking better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the Firming Night Cream about two weeks now and my skin seems smoother and my complexion better. Plus I've always had a problem with dry skin and the Night Cream is great at hydrating the skin. I havent had a problem with dry skin since starting this product. It moisturizes all day and I havent had to re-apply it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle +Firming Night Cream. It makes my skin feel so soft and moisturized. I have noticed in just the 3 to 4 days that I have used it a slight change in the fine lines around my eyes and mouth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The night cream. I cannot talk enough great things about the night cream. It smells wonderful, it applies evenly and nicely with just a little bit. The cream Isn't greasy and I wake up noticing a difference. 2 weeks of use and my skin is glowing when I wake up and has me seeing a noticeable difference. This is definitely a cream to keep in the cabinets for nightly use. My favorite of the regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I've been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream for over a week now and I love this stuff! There is no greasy feel to it at all and I love how soft it leaves my skin. With in three days I started noticing a different in those little wrinkles on my neck! My complexion is starting to smooth out and my trouble zones are clearing up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the firming night cream, have been using it for about 10 days. Slight difference in the look of the skin, but I can feel a major difference in my skin. It is definitely feeling more smooth! I can't wait to see what 10 more days does! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the first time I have used a night cream and when starting my face was very dry and flaky in some spots. Within two days of using this cream it is completely gone and my face feels plump again. When purchasing this product know that it is thicker than the rest of the product line so a little goes along way and smooth it into the skin starting from the neck and working your way up to the forehead.

"I have used the L'Oreal Night Cream for a week. I love it. It is light and creamy without being greasy. Your face just drinks it in, like a glass of cold water. It has a nice smell. I have been very pleased and thrilled with the night cream and to think it is anti-wrinkle is just one more added bonus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the consistency of this product is decent--very thick but what you would expect from a night cream. Absolutely cannot stand the smell though and that's a deal breaker for me. Didn't see much in terms of ""results"" but my skin did feel soft after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The night cream is totally worth the money! My face is smooth, softer, and the fine lines are fading. The cream is thick, so a little goes a long way. Also its not greasy, so there's no worries about break outs as you sleep. I found my new night cream!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the night cream. It does not smell or break out your skin. It does make my skin feel firmer and it seems to be helping the darker spots of skin I had become lighter. The pic. is of my cheek where the darker skin was [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream for several weeks and enjoyed the product a lot. I used this cream at night before bed and noticed a more healthy glow to my skin in about a week or so. It does have a slight smell to it but it is not over powering. A little of the cream goes a long way and it goes on smoothly and is not greasy at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just got this in the mail a week ago and I have been using it everyday since it arrived.After 1 week I have noticed that my face is becoming firmer.I also love that this product has a very light fresh clean smell and that it is not greasy.I can't wait to see what the next 3 weeks brings.

I was skeptical that a moderately priced night cream would deliver what it promised. I have been using this product for 2 weeks and was pleasantly surprised. I wake up with smooth hydrated skin. It contains retinol which is drying but this product doesnt dry out my skin at all. I dont know that it does all that much lifting but the appearance of my skin has improved. i would recommend it for all ages. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did not care for the L'Oreal RevitaLift Night Cream. It reminded me of cheap hand lotion in both smell and texture. It did leave my face slightly softer after using it but I noticed no long term effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The night cream is a great addition to work while I sleep. Like the other steps, it's nice and creamy without being too greasy to sleep in. Skin is smooth and refreshed in the morning. Application is easy and packaging is clear for which one is the night cream after I've removed my glasses! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream for 7 days. It is a great moisturizer after cleansing my face. A little goes a long way and it added just the right amount of moisture. I was glad that it did not leave my face shiny when I awoke in the morning. It also did not leave my skin feeling greasy. Because it absorbs well, it did not just sit on top of my skin. My skin looked healthier and glowed in the mornings after using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
smells great not greasy feels so good to take my makeup off every night and smooth this on and know I am doing something good for those fine lines and elasticity lacking spots on my face. The bottles are great mix and match products to customize what your skin needs. Makes your skin super soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been searching for a night cream to moisture my skin after I remove makeup. This is exactly what I've been searching for!! It rehydrates my skin after the soap has stripped all the oils. The morning after my skin looks rejuvenated and supple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I believe this RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream is FANTASTIC! My skin now, in the morning is so smooth and soft I can go through the day with minimal makeup..which is a 1st for me. Not sure if they also added face wash to this line of RevitaLift but if they do I for sure would purchase it. Thanks L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The night cream has a relaxing scent to it unlike a lot of other products on the shelf. There is no chemical smell which is always a plus! Between the night cream and the day cream my skin has improved tremendously. I will definitely continue to use this whole line. The night cream goes on like butter! It is not to thick or to oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a thick cream, which gives you the impression of a product that's going to hydrate your face and prevent wrinkles. Is that true? Well, only time and repeated usage will tell. What I like about it is that it's not oily and you don't need to apply too much. The smell could be improved, in my opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a thicker facial cream so you don't need much, a little goes a long way. It goes on smoothly but is slightly sticky once it dries. I don't care for the smell but isn't that bad, can learn to live with it. I've been using for approx 14 days but have not seen any results in the firming or anti-wrinkle agents in it. I will continue to use, probably takes additional time to see any type of difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I liked the feel and scent of this cream. It left my skin feeling smooth, soft and hydrated. It didn't do much for my wrinkles. I felt my skin slightly firmer but nothing drastic nor noticeable. I didn't receive a single compliment nor did anyone notice any difference about my skin. Good moisturizer though, just didn't live up to its claims necessarily.

"This cream is kind of thick however it is well absorbed by the skin. I have more of a nightly routine and L'Oreal Revitalift is perfect for me. After cleaning my face, it always gets dry, now after applying the cream, my face feels so smooth and soft. It has been about a week of me using it and I love how my skin feels. It is an absolute must. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've never been one to use a product on my skin at night so when I received the RevitalLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream I decided to give it a try. While it's a little oily and sticky you don't notice it throughout the night. I've started to notice my skin getting a little tighter - especially around the jaw line and people have commented that my skin is brighter so that's a good sign this product must be working! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am really impressed with this night cream! I am a night cream newbie in my early thirties and felt like it is time to nail down a skin care routine. So far I have found my skin to feel tighter, LOOK better and my fine lines seem even finer. I am very happy with this cream and will continue to use it as a part of my daily skin care regimen! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The night cream is great! It is very thick so you don't need a ton of it and it seems like it lasts in the container. I am very pro anything I can use overnight while I sleep that will help. I do recommend washing your face before using this product so you make sure it going on a clean fresh face each time! If you don't normally wash at night I would. This line didn't come with a face wash so I use my normal regimen in that regard. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My experience using this cream was nice. I never use any product for treat this area and when I started to use it I have noticed the face with less wrinkles and without eye bags. Also I noticed firming and hydrated skin. Finally it is smooth and have good fragance. Thanks, L'OREAL. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the cream for 2 weeks I really liked the night cream. It left my face soft and hydrated when I woke up. It is thick so you tend to use a lot but it has a light scent so it isn't overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the RevitaLift Firming Night Cream nightly for a week, and am very pleased so far with the results. My face is very smooth, and I think it has a glow! The cream is very rich, applies easily and absorbs completely. There is no obnoxious scent. While it's a bit early to report anti-wrinkle benefits (only reason I didn't give all 5 stars), I like using this cream. Based on the good reputation of L'Oreal products, I expect this will be part of my on-going routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this for almost two weeks now and I can defininitely see a difference.

"I love putting this on before bed, it makes my face feel so nice and smooth. I've been using this regularly for about a week now and I have to say my son looks healthier, more of a glow.

"Im 56 years old and have tried many creams over the years. Ive been using this night cream for 2 weeks. It really does do all it says, it does firm the skin and reduce fine lines while you sleep!

I have been using the L'Oréal revitalift products for almost a week now and it is starting to firm up. I am using the night cream which is non greasy.

"I was hesitant to try to Loreal night Cream, as my prior uses of other night creams were not good. I actually like this!! It did not leave my face feeling greasy or lead me to break out. I love how soften my face feels just over a few days of use and it feels like my face has firmed up a bit The smell is pleasant, which is an added bonus. Would definitely recommend!

"It's literally like magic! I wake up and everyday my face looks more and more moisturized, and firm. The smell is pretty nice, and the cream isn't oily. Previous to this I didn't have facial cream regimen, but I think from now on I am a lifer for Loreal! The price point is great and the product works like a charm! The only down side is I wish I had more time to do the campaign and give more detailed results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this cream for 1 week and I'm not entirely sure how I feel about it. It is a rich cream that doesn't have much of a smell and is not greasy. It does not smooth on the best. It is a pretty solid cream that you can't really get a nice grip on. It seems to be doing a fine job as I have noticed a more balanced skin tone. I wish it smoothed on my skin better, but I will continue to use it for a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far, I'm absolutely loving this product. I could do without the scent, but I have only been using it a week and feel like I can already tell a difference in my forehead lines. I'm about to turn 34 and have never really taken great care of my skin, this cream is smooth (not sticky at all) and gives my face the moisture it needs in this dryer cooler weather. I will definitely continue using this product and recommend it to others! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I do not normally use night cream on my face. I didn't know what to expect from using this night cream. I was very please with how my skin felt after application and how good my skin feels after using this product for the last few weeks. The texture of the cream is great. It is easy to remove from your hands. The cream has a nice smell to it. I really liked using this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My favorite part of this night Cream is that I can put it on and go straight to bed without damaging my pillow case with grease or getting my hair all icky. A lot of companies think night Cream = greasy, thick mask and can be very uncomfortable. L'Oreal does it right but giving high moisture without feeling like I'm slapping lard on my face. Like how refreshed and healthy my skin has been looking every morning, even if I don't get good sleep. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I personally like this night cream, I can see a difference under my chin area.

I really liked this. It was light on my face and it was still on when I woke up. I really expected this to wipe off on the pillow because I toss and turn alot. Surprise!

"I started using this product a week before a milestone birthday for me. The literature on the box said I would see results in ""just four weeks"" but I noticed a definitive change in one week. Honestly, my skin appears younger looking each morning in the mirror which is a fantastic and pleasant surprise for me. This is a better result than I have had with numerous other brand products.

"I love this night cream! I have never tried one before and I have to admit I was very afraid it along with the other steps would make my face greasy, but that was so not the case. A little cream goes a long way. My face feels so good after I put it on. I have to make myself quit touching it. I have been using this for a week now and a can already see results.

"I have been using this for about 2 weeks now. I have used the day and night cream both. I am not a fan of strong smelling lotions and was pleasantly surprised by the clean, fresh sent of this cream.

"From the first time I tried it, I loved the feel of the RevitalLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream. My face is sensitive, but it did not cause any breakouts or redness.

"At first, I wasn't sure I felt about this product because of its heavy fragrance. However, the scent is nice and so is the formula of the cream. It's very heavy and thick upon first touch, but it absorbs the well and the next morning my skin feels moisturizer and firm. I will use the entire jar and see if there are any long term effects. In my 30s my skin is drier and could use some retinol - this moisturizer I think will do the trick! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This is an amazing product. I use it every night and go to bed feeling soft and hydrated. I think the part I love best is how, in the morning, I still feel like I have hydrated skin. Just a little bit absorbs completely into my skin without an oily or smelly residue. I simply feel soft. I used a pore minimizing lotion prior to this and truth be told, this night Cream hasn't negatively affected my skin or pores. No break outs. No oily skin. Just a great soft outcome!

Really love this night cream. Was a little worried that it might be greasey and clog my pores but it is neither. Love how it makes my skin feel soft and moisturized. Usually I have to keep putting moisturizer on my face because it feels so dry with other products but not with this one. The sent is great also. Will definitely keep using this.

I think I love this stuff. I've only been using the Revitalift anti wrinkle + firming night cream for a couple of weeks but I can already feel a difference in my face and neck. My face feels softer and firmer in just this short time. The cream smells nice and rubs in nicely with no filmy feeling. I will continue to use this product in the future.

I have been using this product for a week now primarily using it in the mornings for my all day moisturizer. Unlike the spf 18 version I like this cream much better. It covers nicely and provides all day moisture without oily and greasy feeling like the spf. I have a really acne prone skin and finding the right balance in skin care is painstakingly exhausting. I really am enjoying the L'Oréal products and may be a new full time user! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love this night cream. I'm using it nightly after the face and neck contour cream. I like that the bottle is blue so you don't have to look at the label to see what is in the jar.

"I really enjoyed using the night cream. The jars are packaged beautifully so I keep them out on the counter to remind me to use every Night. The cream went on smooth and was not too thick even though at first it does seem more like a butter than cream.

Hoping that using these products will help prevent some aging with firming. I didn't have a good routine before, so having the L'Oréal Night Creme is definitely a step in the right direction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the night cream. It has a pleasant fragrance and is not at all greasy. I use it every night and I use the face/neck cream and eye cream everyday. Makes my skin feel great. A little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love having something for the night after I wash my face. This goes on easy and I love that the jar is blue to differentiate it from the day cream. My husband loves it as well since I am including him in on my nightly routine and he gets the lotion too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This night cream makes my skin so soft in the morning. I love moisturizing my face at night that's when I feel like it makes the biggest difference. I am excited to see how it works over the next few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A little goes a long way with this cream unlike others that are thick this one is also light and spreads nicely it doesn't irritate my skin or leave greasy marks on my pillows it does make my skin feel very smooth and when I wake up in the morning my skin still feels smooth as for the scent I didn't really mind it it kinda smells like baby wipes to me and not to strong as for firming my skin I think that will take more then a week to notice but I do like the night cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream is a thick, rich cream for use at night. While you sleep, it does it's magic. It firms and tightens skin and brightens it as well. it's economical to use too. I have used it for about a week and can see the difference already. it goes on smooth and feels so good that you'll love it the first time you use it. As it feels so good, it is actually doing it's work to a firmer, brighter face for you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the night cream for about a week now and am very pleased with it. It goes on smoothly and seems to work its magic overnight. I like this well enough to continue using it. The cost is very reasonable compared to the much more expensive night cream I have been using . This seems to work as well so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using all of the above products faithfully since receiving my Bzz kit- I have noticed a slight difference just within a couple weeks and i am sure those results will continue to get better in just a couple more weeks! This is a product that i have been wanting to try and I am sorry I did not purchase it long ago BUT i will be a customer of all of these products from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm kind of a slacker when it comes to a nighttime regimen, but I really like this cream whenever I use it. It has a nice texture and fragrance, and goes on very smoothly. I have always had a hard time finding a good night cream, and this one really fits the bill! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product smells bad! My husband commented on it when he entered the room. It feels great on your skin, not greasy. Skin instantly felt velvety. I did start to see some results within a week on my skins overall appearance. If you can get past the smell it's good. 5 star if it smelled less. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I could not get around the smell of this cream. It smells like fresh bar soap and that is a distracting scent when you are heading to bed. I kept thinking I needed to rinse my face. The cream was also irritating to my very sensitive skin. I was left with a slight itching. This may work better for someone with normal skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The texture of L'Oreal's Night Cream is my favorite out of the four products from their Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle and Firming line. A small dab will go far in covering the entire face, yet it feels very light and airy. There was a scent to the cream that I wasn't very fond of (which is why I gave 3 out of 5 stars), but it wasn't strong enough to prevent me from using it. I did feel that it adequately moisturized my skin throughout the night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far I really like the night cream. I like that is in a different color jar to easily find and differentiate from the day cream. It has a light sent to it and it's not too heavy. My skin tends to be on the sensitive side and this has not irritated it or made my face red at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am a product junkie and am really impressed with this cream. I've used it each night for the past week, and I wake up with a thoroughly refreshed and moisturized face. It's really thick so I have to rub it in very, very well. With this winter weather, it's just what my face needs. Will continue to use to see if the products works as noted on the package. So far it's very hydrating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a very moisturizing product but not heavy. It smells like baby wipes, which to me, isn't an unpleasant smell. Also, another important thing to me, it doesn't tingle or burn. I dont have sensitive skin per se, but some of the ones that tingle leave my face red and hot. This product works great for just a nice light moisturizer I haven't really seen any other results yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is great! It makes my skin feel nice and hydrated and I feel the overall appearance of my skin has improved in less than a week. The only con is that it is a little too perfumed for night time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Again, only used two weeks so far so hoping for more results in the next two weeks. I love that it is in a different color box so I know it is the night cream. I has a great creamy texture and applies so smoothly. It is not a heavy cream at all-very light weight. I hope to report great changes in the next two weeks!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only used the night cream for Les than a week, but I already feel a difference. My skin is not as dry and flakey when I wake up and this time of year it usually is. I don't really see a difference yet, but am hopeful that after a few more weeks, I will. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream is pleasantly scented and has a nice smooth creamy feel to it. I haven't used it long enough to say it definitely does what it claims to do but I do know that my face feels smoother. And smells good too! This doesn't make my skin feel like I slathered on a bunch of grease. I am going to continue using this and see what happens. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This stuff is amazing! I'm not saying that I saw an immediate difference in 2 nights, but my face felt so soft and smooth after putting it on a couple of days in a row. The firming night cream is very smooth texture to put it on. Just the perfect level of creaminess and thickness. I am very happy to keep using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was most impressed with the night cream. My face looks and feels great. It looks smoother and is really moisturized. My skin tone even looks more even. My fine lines and wrinkles are less prominent. Only a very positive experience! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Using just a little bit on my neck face and decollete my face skin like velvet and my skin looked firmer! A bit heavy for my face so will use it in winter for my face and neck and for my neck in summer. I used to work in the sun a lot on different jobs when I was young so sun damage has made my jowls more apparent(freckles). This product does appear to smooth and tighten the area where my neck and face meet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It smells wonderful, it feels great, but that's where the great news ended for me. I woke up the next morning with Red, painful horribly blotchy skin. It took a week to get better. AWFUL! I do have sensitive skin but most this don't bother me. The day cream was fine. Not sure the difference in the ingredients but it ended up being horrible! The NIGHTcream is a NIGHTmare for the sensitive skinned folks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Night Cream is also too greasy for me just like the day cream. I put it on real sparingly to make it less greasy.I need to use it for a few more weeks to decide if it helped reduce my wrinkled or make my skin firmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the way my face feels after using this cream overnight. I can feel a big difference. My face is smoother, tighter and feels so moisturized. The overnight process is working great, I just don't like the smell, but I'm willing to put up with it for the results I'm getting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am 47... obviously want to prevent the look of wrinkles with anything I can. This product I have tried for about 7 or 8 nights used on face and neck, and I had to stop using. Clogged my pores ! I do not usually get pimples, but this product must have clogged my pores and I had in one week 3 pimples. Stopped using and didn't get any new ones. They are going away, but it takes awhile (the painful invisible ones that hurt ). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this everyday for a week now and my skin is so soft. I love this because I have really sensitive skin and it does not cause me to break out. I will be getting this again when I run out! I love that it smells good and does not leave a greasy feeling. I would highly suggest this product if you need some life back in your skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that this night cream is amazing. I like that is it not over scented, creamy and fast absorbing. I don't see any visible reduction in wrinkles but I haven't been using it for an extended period. I think I will continue to use this night cream. It has not broken out out my skin which is great and it doesn't feel greasy which I'd a huge bonus when I look for a face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for only a few days, but am impressed already. Normally I am wary of claims made by cosmetic companies. However, I have already found that my skin seems more firm with fewer fine lines in the mornings after using this product at night. I suspect that continued use will help my skin appear younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This has been the best product . My skin is not greasy after applying it before bed, my face feels relaxed. When I wake up my face and neck are so soft to touch and feels firmer with noticeable less sagging skin and fewer wrinkle lines especially around the lip area and forehead just after 2 weeks of use wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Cream is light weight and non-greasy, which is perfect for my oily skin. This product has a slight perfume smell but I find it refreshing and not overpowering. I love waking up with smooth and soft skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm loving L'Oreal's Firming Night Cream! I use it right after I wash my face just before going to bed. It smells and feels great on my skin when I apply it and when I wake up my skin feels so smooth! Other night creams I've tried left my skin in the morning feeling greasy and even caused breakouts, but I haven't had those issues with L'Oreal's Firming Night Cream. I'm a multi-tasker by nature so just knowing that this cream is getting the job done while I sleep thrills me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream was thick and very moisturizing, which you expect from a good night cream. However it was too heavy for my skin, and caused me to break out. I couldn't use it long enough to see any anti-aging benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the RevitaLift night cream is amazing, it leaves my face feeling soft and refresh. I also tried the day cream and eye cream. I would use both before applying my makeup. It kept my face moist all day and the eye cream I could tell the difference in how my under eye looked. Before using the cream my face stayed dry. My eyes would be puffy especially in the morning but since using the products I can tell the tightness and tone of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the firming night cream for just about a week now and love the way it makes my skin feel hydrated throughout the night. It is that time of year when I usually wake up with very dry itchy and cracking skin. I have been waking up with very hydrated skin. The firmness does seem to be slowly getting there so I will be using it for a few more weeks for more results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this product, the Loreal Revitalift NightCream. You only need to use a small amount and wow. When I woke up the next morning my skin was soft. After I week I noticed less fine lines and wrinkles overall on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The night cream is easily absorbed. It's not greasy at all. My skin is sensitive, and L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream doesn't cause any irritation on my skin which is a big plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this firming night cream is wonderful. The cream has a wonderful fragrance and works wonders on my face. It feels softer and looks really great. I have only used it for a week or two and I am already getting compliments on how good my face looks. I am so happy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle+Firming Night Cream was thick and made my skin feel so smooth and wonderful in the morning. I already noticed some of the dark spots have faded after 2 weeks. It not only made my skin soft but I noticed the firmness too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love the night cream. It makes my face feel amazing when I apply and it is totally refreshing! As with other products within this line, it isn't any oily or greasy feeling. No breakouts and it smells great! I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this a fantastic product. Not greasy or thin. Feels nice to apply. Very moisturizing and can feel the difference. Excellent product. Will be buying. Live that it's going to help my dark circles [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like the night cream. I don't often use creams on my face but this one is great. It has a fresh smell and it is light. I use it before I go to bed after the shower and I feel like it really helps my firm and freshen up my skin. Also I have had reactions to some creams in the past but this one wasn't harsh at all and caused no redness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Of course the wrinkles haven't disappeared overnight - not yet anyway! But I can say that I love the consistency of the cream and the beautiful smell that all of these products have - it smells sort of likely baby lotion. The products go on nice and rich feeling but then absorb into our skin so you don't feel greasy going to bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that if you can get into a routine of applying creams to you face that it will make a difference. The trick is to make it a habit. I don't know what kind of difference this product has made because I have only been using it for a couple of days. I am applying a small amount and it goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love that this cream is so thick. It hydrates my skin so well, but isn't greasy at all. The next morning my skin is unbelievably soft and youthful. In the short time I've used it, I've already noticed an improvement! Oh...and it smells amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have never used a night cream prior to trying REvitalift and have found that it, along with the Day Cream have made my skin softer in just a week's use. I am anxious to see the affects of the treatment after the full four weeks of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the Revitalift Night Cream from L'Oreal overall. It has a nice feel to it and is not oily, which with my skin that is a definite plus for me since my skin type changes frequently depending on the weather. I love how firm it feels in the jar, but how lightweight it feels when applied. I have been pleased with it so far and cannot wait to see the results in 2-4 weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In just 4 nights of using this I have seen a difference. I can only hope after 4 weeks of use, I will see amazing results. I have tried a lot of other night creams, with little or no effect, but this product is different. I can see this product really works, firming the skin, and lessening the fine lines. Great product, will keep using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream wasn't that bad... or good. Its very thick, so you don't need much. It goes on pretty greasy & some mornings I woke up with dry skin in some areas. The smell was a little strong for me, I prefer a lighter scent, this one smelled like cold cream & stayed with me all evening. If you have dry skin, this may be the night cream for you, if you don't, then I'd look for a less greasy option. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Refreshing to wake up to soft and silky skin. It is amazing to not have to use so much moisturizer in the morning to make my skin soft. Can't wait to see how my skin feels after four weeks of using since I have only been using a week! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This night cream was really nice. It did leave my skin a tad bit oily which is why i only gave it three stars. I use acne medicines at night so i am not that huge of a fan of night cream.it does leave your skin smooth [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I usually do not like putting moisturizer on at night because it never seems to dry quick enough and you end up getting it all over your pillow. This night Cream is awesome! It dried quicker than most and didn't leave that sticky after feeling. Also, my face is so soft and smooth! I found my new night Cream for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love the night cream. It makes my face feel amazing once I put it on, it is almost refreshing! Like comparing to the other products within this line, it isn't oily or greasy feeling. It doesn't make my face break out or anything like that and it smells great! I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far I love the night cream. My face feels soft after I use it. It is not greasy and rubs in quickly. Overall the is a difference in the way my face feels when I use it at night before bed. I have not seen a difference in the wrinkles but I have only used it for a short time. I want to keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"With the passage of time the signs of aging are becoming more visible. I began to use Loreal Revitalift Night Cream conciderable noticing a rafter. The soft, rejuvenated and radiant skin. The cream is light, has a pleasant smell also comes in a very striking and comfortable to have it on your dresser or carry it in your bag packaging. I recommend it.

"I was weary on giving the night cream a go. But I did, and I'm so glad I did! I actually feel working! It smells so good and it is nice going on. my skin is hydrated and soft. I can easily find it in any store, and it doesn't cost a fortune. I have seen improvement in the look and feel of my skin.I'll definitely be adding this to my regular skin care routine [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is one of the few night creams I actually feel working! I love the way it smells and it is nice and thick going on. I feel that my skin stays hydrated through the night and I can see some improvement in my skin after about 1 week of use. This is a great product that I can easily find in my local stores, and it doesn't cost a fortune. I have seen improvement in the look and feel of my skin, especially when I get up in the morning. I'll be adding this to my regular skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can't believe the difference in my skin in just one week!!! Anyone considering the L'Oreal line of face creams and sun protection should rush out and do it!! You will thank yourself. I have gotten compliments about how something is different, but people can't quite put their finger on it!! I am so excited to see myself after 2-4 weeks!!! This is a very nice product and something nice that you can do for yourself!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Do you want to be pampered all night long? L'Oreal RevitaLift Night Cream does that for me! It feels great on my freshly washed face, hydrating my face with a light scent. I go to sleep with a smile on my face and and wake up with soft skin in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how special I feel using the Revitalift night Cream! It's very thick and luxurious. The fragrance is light and pretty. Best of all, my face feels so nice and smooth and hydrated in the morning! I'm sold! If you're starting to get discouraged by fine lines and wrinkles as I am, try this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using this product 5 days ago. I added it to my nightly routine and I'm so glad that I did. First the bottle is very cute it looks nice next to my sink :). The smell is very pleasing it has an expensive adult smell to it (it's not a fruity note). It goes on very nice not to thick not to watery. I'm 30 so I don't have many wrinkles but it sure leaves my face feeling smooth and slightly tighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream is another great product from L'Oréal. It goes on smooth without any oily or sticky feel on my face. It penetrates quickly to replenish my skin. Also, has a very nice fragrance. Another winner from L'Oréal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a very good cream. First it comes in glass jars giving it the feel of an expensive cream even though it's not. There are no strong chemical smells. It gives my skin a nice texture and moisturizes but without the oiliness that comes with alot of night creams. Overall a very good night cream ladies. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the Revitalift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream! I really feel pampered using it. At fist look it appears thick and greasy but it's truly not it rubs all the way in and does not leave a film or greasy feel just smooth and softness. Very light and pleasant smell, to me it almost smells like a very very light baby powder maybe. When I wake up of a morning still silky smooth! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I work for a dermatologist so I try many wrinkle creams. I liked the texture of this one and the very light feel. I am 52 so being proactive is a must. I will be watching the texture of my skin over the next few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the night cream for a couple days now. I use to wake up with my face really dry and itching and cracked skin. Since I have been using this cream I have been waking up with really smooth skin and my face it not dried out or itchy. I would really recommend this product to anyone that has problems with their face drying out over night [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Just recieved my kit and I am so thrilled with it. I'll be posting some before and after pics of the wrinkles around my eyes to let everyone see the difference. I love the smell and texture of all the items in my kit. I think the packaging is wonderful also. I couldn't be happier with the results I've had so far.. Thanks L'oreal and BuzzAgent.. What a winner this is... just like my favorite baseball team,, THE CUBS... You've really brought it home with this kit.. peace and joy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I am pleased with the results of the Loreal AntiWrinkle and Firming day cream. In the short time I've been using it my skin is softer and firmer. It has a nice fragrance and is non greasy. I would recommend it for sure [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this night cream for a little over a week. I was very nervous about using anything with ""cream"" in the title since I have combination skin that breaks out easily. So far this night cream has been great - it hasn't broken my skin out at all and I wake up with moisturized glowing skin. I haven't seen any firming results yet but it's only been a week so there's still plenty of time for that. I will continue to use this night cream.

"This came at such a great time! Seasons are changing here and my skin needs extra moisture during the cold months. I have always been a fan of the L'Oreal face wash, but I've never used the night cream. I am now a fan:) I have noticed my skin is less dry, even after a few days:) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love the night cream. I feels good on my face and when I wake up in the morning my face already looks and feels great and replenished. I have always used moisturizer at night but it didn't make my skin softer and firmer like this product did. Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this product only 1 time so far but it is amazing. It takes just a small amount of the product to cover my whole face. The jar will last a long time. I love the light refreshing scent. My face feels hydrated and so smooth this morning. It does not leave a greasy feeling at all. Looking forward to see how my skin looks after prolonged use!

I love the products from L'Oreal Paris. Their RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle creams are very effective. In only 10 days I was able to see a noticeable difference and the compliments are never ending!!

"I think that the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream has a nice soft scent, which I am very pleased with, since I strong overpowering scents bother my allergies. I also noticed that the night cream is a bit thicker than I anticipated. Before applying my skin was a bit dry, but it seemed to moisturize very well. I feel like I am going to be happy with this product.... and can't wait to start seeing visual effects from using it..... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Omg I have been using the Anti Wrinkle night cream in combination with the day moisture cream. And I would first like to mention that Im in love with this new Thick n Super Creamy Reviltize night cream this made my skin feel so soft, smooth and supple after using the first application. I can say this product works perfect for the dry areas on my face. Im in love! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just received my free samples and I can honestly say I really like this. First, it smells fantastic! It has a lovely, light scent. Not overpowering at all. Second, it makes my face feel like butter. I've only used it for a few days but I really like how it makes my face feel. I have pretty sensitive skin so I was nervous about trying it but so far so good. No redness or irritations at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Very hydrating cream! Nice smooth feel with a very clean scent. A small amount of the cream covers a large area. There is a slight greasy feel after application. Skin feels very moisturizers and clean [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The texture of the cream is not runny. There seems to be some depth in the formula making it adhere to the skin smoothly without any greasiness. I was not fond of the scent of the product, it takes several minutes for the scent to fade away. I generally like fragrance-free products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream will make us all think twice, maybe more, before we think of an eye fix or surgery. This cream while hydrating also lightens and reduces the sagging skin of the upper eyes, also gives the appearance of healthy contour, which makes your eye make-up more sustained for the all day routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was a special treat for my skin. I apply this luxurious cream before I go to bed and let it do it's magic. I wake up to moisturized and a more youthful looking skin. It doesn't leave a funny film on my pillow either. I can't wait to wipe the years off my face while I sleep! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the silky feel of this cream. Used it as directed at nighttime, including my neck and decolletage and waking up to a softer feeling and looking chest area is such a treat! I have ignored this part of my skin regime for too long, and this night firming cream is really making a difference [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great lightweight night cream with a slight pleasant scent. It's a bit more moisturizing than the day cream but I like more moisture at night. I wake up and my skin feels so soft and smooth plus it looks so much firmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the RevitaLift-Anti-Wrinkle + firiming cream is amazing I put it on at night before I went to bed an it made my skin so soft I love this cream! I got up this morning an my skin felt firmer than it has in I know a year! This product is amazing after just 2 uses ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Used the Loreal RevitaLift Firming Night Cream last night, liked that it was smooth and not greasy. Actually felt like I didn't put it on but I had a problem with the fragrance. It was a little strong for me, I prefer a lighter scent especially when going to bed at night as fragrances give me a headache. Will continue to try it though to see how the product works and if the fragrance continues to be an issue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin felt so soft after only one use! This cream wasn't too thick or emollient. It provided enough moisture to my skin to look refreshed, but wasn't so heavy that it caused break outs. My skin looked visibly plumper and younger the very next day. I will definitely be buying this again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this L'Oreal night cream. It had a great scent, not to overpowering. My skin felt so soft after using. I have had issues with other moisturizers leaving my face greasy or causing me to break out. I had neither issue with this product. I also love the price point. I think it is just as good if not better than the more pricey brands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream was the fairest of them all..... and thickest LOL. It makes the perfect overnight moisturizer. Its nice and thick but not too heavy. I feel really lucky to have participated in this bzz kit. This is a product that I wouldn't have bought on my own and now I am hooked. I am really excited to see my upcoming results.

Night creams are the best just put it on and go to bed and the cream does the rest. The night cream leaves your face feeling silky and not all sticky like some night creams do. L'Oréal has done a good job with there revitalift line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the product would work great for someone with a different skin type than mine. I haven't seen a huge difference but what i have noticed my skin looks healthier. On the down side in the morning it feels greedier than it normally would be especially my t-zone. Other than that i liked the product and how it felt light weight when i first originally put it on.

I have used the night cream twice. So far so good. Smells good and feels silly. My face does however feel more oily that usual in the morning. With most of the containers looking the same I love that the night cream is easy to differentiate due to the blue container. Being busy and always on the go this is helpful.

"I think this product is great! I was skeptical about using a lotion type cream on my sensitive face. I was afraid that it was going to clog my pores. But I was surprised how light the cream is, and how easy to apply as well. This has become a nightly ritual for me. And my face feels wonderful, soft and youthful.

"I think this product is great, light sent, not greasy. I think I actually slept better with the soft sent. It was relaxing after applying the product to my face and going to bed. I can't wait for tonight! :) The product states it can take up to 4 weeks for the results, I will continue to use all products, and post up dates! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Thanks so much for letting me sample RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream. This is a great product. I really like how it go on grease free and leaves my face feeling smooth and looking beautiful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just love this night cream! It went on smooth and my face was left feeling refreshed! I am always fighting oily skin and creams are always a hit or miss with that. I did not have any issues at all with excess oil. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am not a night face care person however after receiving and trying this product that will change. I loved the scent - was fresh and clean and not too heavy scented in my opinion. I tend to have oily skin so I worried about a greasy face - not to worry! This cream is light fast absorbing but luxurious feeling on the face. I felt like I was pampering my face. I also like that it came in a nice glass jar. I will be adding to my nighttime routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Wow! It's been 4 nights of using and I can't believe how smooth my face feels! It has really worked on my dry spots and hoping to see my fine wrinkles disappear. I'm hoping that this product will help suppliment the recent Restylane injections that I had done. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream is a little more scented than I like, but not too bad of a scent. It is a great moisturizer! My skin doesn't feel greasy and have had no breakouts. I always find it difficult to get an anti wrinkle cream that doesn't cause breakouts. It is a thick and a little goes a long way. I really like it.

"I have never been one to use a night cream as they were usually greasy and got all over everything. With the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream, that isn't the case! Its non-greasy and it absorbed in right away. It does have a fragrance, but its light so it isn't to bad. In the mornings my skin looked smoother and felt firmer. Its only been a week.... I can't wait to see the changes after four weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle+Firming Night Cream for 5 nights and I am totally in love with this product!! I wake up and my face feels hydrated and so soft. Even some of the fine lines have disappeared!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I followed the instructions on the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream. I have never used a nightly cream before. It went on smooth and did not feel greasy at all. It also did not feel heavy on my face. I did not feel like my pores were being clogged. I woke up and my skin felt soft and smooth. The only reason why I didn't give it 5 starts is the smell. The smell is pleasant but just not my personal preference. It does not smell bad, just not my personal taste. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely recommend this cream .I wanted to find a cream to apply at night after my makeup removal that wasn't too oily and dries quickly. It went on easily with no oily feel and I felt refreshed in the morning after using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream has this wonderful, calming smell. It is creamy and goes on smooth. My skin did not feel sticky or weighted down after applying the L'oreal Night Cream. The scent lingered for some time, but was not overwhelming. I was very calming, My skin was smooth and silky. I will definetly buy this produck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the scent, it has a clean light soap scent. The best part is doesn't make my skin feel greasy. I haven't applied any of the other products yet, but it makes my skin feel so soft. Loving the Loreal Paris Revitalift system so far. What would I want to know before I get this product? It is quickly absorbed into the skin. You should smooth it on gently. You can use it alone or layer as needed. It's non-greasy. Makes your face feel rejuvenated and soft! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Well try it again and what a great feeling in my face the next day really soft doesn't irritate my skin I tend to get some red marks with some creams but this product doesn't that's so great and I am gone to keep trying the other products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is one of the best night creams I have tried. A little goes a long way. It made my skin tingle a little but it wasn't uncomfortable. When I woke up the next more my skin still felt really moisturized and firmer. I have already noticed some firming skin around my mouth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Just received my l'oreal revitalift. I'm very excited for this product. I'm 30 and mom to three, I have dark circles under my eyes and I can see the wrinkles starting to appear. so I started with the night cream tonight. It has a great smell and a little bit went a long way for me. It dried very fast, dried before goodnight kisses from my trio. My skin feels soft to the touch. I like this product so far and can't wait to see the results from the products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Last up in my line of reviews is the Night Cream. Never have used night cream as I always thought it would make my clean skin feel greasy. This is not the case at all and I was pleasantly surprised. My skin feels very soft and not heavy at all. Looking forward to seeing if the entire line up of products makes a difference when used in combination and more importantly if others notice the difference too. I'm purposely not telling anyone what I'm doing differently-YET! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am not one to wear a nighttime moisturizer because they usually leave me feeling greasy and Oily. Not this one this one left me feeling clean and moisturized. My skin felt soft yet firm and the fragrance was very light. I would buy this again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is the best night cream that I have ever used. The cream itself is fairly thick but feels light an non-greasy on my face. I really like the way it smells too. It absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves it feeling soft and moisturized. I will absolutely purchase this in the future [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I starting using L'Oreal products back in high school, which is more than 15 years ago. I, however, have never used their nighttime products and I can't wait to see the results. This nighttime cream is very rich in moisturizing my face, which is a great benefit as my face has been rather dry. I applied this product last night for the first time and by morning my face was feeling less dry. I can't wait to see if this product performs as stated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I finally got my samples to try. I used the night cream last night. This morning my skin felt better. Could be my imagination but don't think so. I am always skeptical when it comes to products but will continue to use this to see how much better my skin will look and feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This nighttime moisturizer did deliver on smoother, firmer skin with its anti-wrinkle and firming action. It worked while I slept. When I woke in the morning, my skin appeared refreshed, radiant, and younger looking. It provides moisturization, just as it says on the box. I have used it every night since receiving it. I smooth it gently onto my face and neck until thoroughly absorbed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've only had it about 3 days but I love this night Cream already. It goes on smooth and a little goes a long way. My skin isn't greasy or sticky and no harsh smells. I've even noticed my skin is starting to get softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the night cream for the first time. I have never used a night cream before but when I woke up there was a noticeable difference in my skin. Usually my skin is full and dry by the time I wake up not so this morning. I am a little nervous about it clogging my pores because it is so thick but we shall see. A little goes a long way with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have always been skeptical of these types of products and honestly the first question I would ask myself is it worth the price! and I am truly happy to say yes! I am truly loving this product I scrub my face every night and always end up with that dry feeling! Until now!!!

"After only a few nights of applying the RevitaLift Anti-wrinkle + Firming night Cream, I have already noticed smoother, softer skin. The first few nights it felt slightly heavy, and left me skin a tad greasy. After continuous use, paired with the RevitaLift Day products, my skin looks and feels healthier. I cannot wait to see the week 4 results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried night cream tonight for the first time. It goes on smooth and feels very moisturizing. It has a smell that is not that appealing but goes away after a while.

"This cream smells wonderful and your skin drinks it in. I use it in the evening after washing my face and I really enjoy the way my face feels. It's silky and smooth going on and after a week or so, I noticed that the ""worry lines"" on my forehead were not so noticeable!! I will continue using this until it's gone and will definitely buy more and make it a regular part of my evening routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The night cream comes in a nice size jar, has a very light smell, a little seems like it will go a long way. The only thing I didn't like too much is it feels really thick on my face. I'll try again tomorrow night and maybe just use a little bit less than I did today. But other than the thickness thanks for making a great product L'Oreal!

It has a nice light scent that makes it feel very high end. It's a great deal for the price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Purchased both the day and the night cream and have a question about them. The day cream has a much lighter weight than the night cream. The night cream I have is like paste and feels really heavy on my skin. the day cream is more on the lotion side. Is this correct? I expected them to be the same. I have had them for a couple of months and just started using them because I have used up my other day/night regime so I don't know about results. I have grey hair and that is not on your color choices -- why not?
sorry to say but i am very disappointed with your anti aging revita lift night cream.I m using it from last three months but i cann't see a single change in my skin. I bougth 4 jar of this cream and using 2 one but it only waste of money.Please advise me what to do should i throw it or still waiting for results.I quit my previous cream but now i found it was my mistake.
"I've been using the Revitalift Night Cream for some time now and am very pleased with this product. Although it goes on a little heavy (I prefer light moisturizers) it does leave my skin feeling silky smooth and hydrated, which I need since my T-zone had become very dry and flaky. Using this cream has helped my problem area from drying out & breaking out too frequently. Just would prefer it were a lighter formula. A good overnight cream."
"My skin was looking very stressed and tired from work. I was very skeptical using this product but it was on sale at my local pharmacy. I put this on the first night and I saw results with in 10 minutes! My skin looks amazing as if I have been resting all day. I usually just wash my face with my preferred cleanser and then use an astringent; however, I will definitely integrate this product as part of my daily night skin routine."
"I bought this cream,because of my pillow-lines,and tired appearance in the morning. I will buy it forever,because i really look that much better when i wake up and look in the mirror-and you all know this is an important moment every Day;) My skin feels great,looks better and feels really smooth,without greasiness,and i absolutely LOVE the smell of this cream,and the neat night blue jar. I end every day with this cream,and can really,really recommend it,also to girls under 40. I´m 38."
I love this night cream! It makes me feel like its working even when I wake in the morning. It helps me look more youthful. The consistancy is thicker than some brands and I like that for the night because then I know it's going on. My husband really likes the smell (a BIG plus) too.
"I am a type of person that doesnot like a greasy product on my skin. This product left my face feeling greasy and dirty. I honestly did not give it a fair amount of time because I could not stand the feel of it on my face. I am 49 years old and am going through menopause - my acne is at a minimal, but I don't want any issues either."
Their are so many skin products that claim to help wrinkles and they are so expensive! I am 48 and have bad sun damage I have or had deep crows feet. frown lines and wrinkles around my mouth.I got a jar of LoReal Revitalift Night Cream and by the time I used half the jar I noticed my wrinkles where not as deep and they keep getting better! I am a smoker so I am sure that if I wasn't the result would have even been better!! I was Shocked That this product really did what it claims
"I needed a moisturizer for night, and also a treatment to fight the first signs of aging. I like the texture of this cream, and the way it feels on my skin. I love the light fragrance, which is comforting. Mostly, I like the way my skin looks when I apply it after cleansing, and without any makeup on! This rich, ivory cream is very pretty! I purchased several, for myself, and also gave one to my mother as a gift on two separate occasions. She likes this night cream too."
"I'm in my early twenties and I was looking to start a beauty regime because I fear getting wrinkles in my early thirties like a few of my friends. I saw that this product had retinol and I snatched it up because when i was a teenager, my dermatologist had me on retinol to clear up my skin. This product smells and feels great on...it's thick but not greasy and my skin is soooooo soft when I wake up and it helps clear up my skin also."
