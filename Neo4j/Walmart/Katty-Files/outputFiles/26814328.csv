"I have been using for 5-6 years! It moisturizes my face, and doesn't break the bank! Also, my makeup goes on nicely after using! I use the night cream as well! Highly recommend!"
"I have sensitive skin and was looking for day and night cream that would hydrate my skin without irritating it. My old favorites have been reformulated to include retinol,which irritates my skin. I am happy to have found these creams."
I have been using this product for a couple of years now and am very pleased with the results.
I have used Neutrogena for years and love the way my skin is.
I hope it will always be available to purchase. I can't imagine using anything else!
I love all products .. I have tried new ones and have never been let down .. Keep up the great work
"After turning 50, I started noticing my face was dry and itchy. I've never had dry skin, so I didn't know what moisturizer to use. Neutrogena Deep Moisture was the first product I tried, and I love it. I combine this product with the Hydro Boost Eye Gel. Together these moisturizers leave my face feeling soft and hydrated, and my skin looks incredible."
I like the feel of this product. It is very moisturizing. I also like that it offer sun protection.
10/10 would not recommend. Most of neutrogena products are great i loved there gel line. This litetally has been a nightmare of my sensative skin. Leaves white residue that i have to rub off irritating my skin further and broke my husbands skin out also.
"I love Neutrogena products, But this Deep Moisture Day Cream with 20SPF is terrible. I get white pills of residue all over my face and neck when I use this face cream. And it has caused an awful rash on my face. I do not have senstive skin. Whatever it is that this lotion contains that is causing it to pill up on the skin , I suspect is the cause my my skin rash, I won't buy any more of this cream."
"I've been slowly trying Neutrogena products to get away from pricier ones but to stay within my budget. This cream has a scent to it that is so strong that my eyes water! I don't know if it is Aloe or what, but it isn't working for me & I plan to return it after trying it 3 times. I really wanted it to work but it doesn't do well for sensitive people."
I brought this product one year ago and loving it!
"I have used this product for over 20 years; I have tried others for a day cream under makeup, but nothing has worked as well as this one. It hydrates me all day, I never looked dull or flaky, and has never bothered my extremely sensitive skin, and great SPF! I'm 53, And look much, much younger."
"I have fairly dry skin. This summer, I had been using a minimal skincare routine with no moisturizer, and my skin was looking clear. Yesterday, my skin felt particularly dry so I used the moisturizer in addition to my facewash. This morning, I woke up with itchy, inflamed bumps on the side of my left cheek. I am very disappointed with this purchase."
"I've been battling dehydrated skin all winter and I've finally turned the tide with this day cream! Once applied, it instantly softened and plumped my skin to pre-winter glowingness. I've been using it as a night cream as well since I couldn't find one at the store."
The scaliness on my cheeks and forehead has been erased and the rough patches on my nose and chin have been smoothed. This has definitely become my winter go-to cream!
"IDM was the only moisturizer I could use for my rosacea. I was a faithful customer for decades, and this is the thanks I get? DMDC is NO substitution. I have tried all the other Neutrogena moisturizing products, IDM was the only thing that worked. I have one precious container left and you have my solemn promise that I will find another company's product to use before that container runs out. I WAS brand loyal-not any longer."
"Only tried this because I recently found out that Intensified Day Moisture was discontinued. Very poor substitute for a superior product. The scent, texture and overall feel are nowhere near the quality of IDM. If this is supposed to replace Intensified Day Moisture, well you have lost a customer. I used Intensified Day Moisture for at least 5 years and never turned away--but now I have been forced away. PLEASE BRING BACK INTENSIFIED DAY MOISTURE!!!"
"I have used the Intensified Day Moisture spf 15 for many years now. I was unable to get it and tried this, as it appeared to be the new and improved replacement. After using it one time my skin was blotchy and red. I returned it this week. I am in search of a cream with the same ingredients as the discontinued Neutrogena product I liked for many years. Why did they have to mess with perfection!"
"I don't use a lot of product of any kind. Intensified Day Moisture was a great product. Like so many others, I bought this as a replacement and was sadly disappointed that it is scented (I guess you don't want men using it anymore), less effective and greasier. Blech. Bring back the original - it's not too late."
"I bought this as replacement for Intensified Day Moisture, and could not be more disappointed. I'm in my mid-40's with extremely dry skin, and Deep Moisture Cream has actually made me feel older and drier. Horrible. Nothing moisturized my skin like IDM, and I'm scrambling to find overstock anywhere, before I switch brands. Please bring back Intensified Day Moisture!"
I bought this product when I could not find the Intensified Day Cream. So disappointing. The new cream makes my skin feel strange....like It is a bit inflamed. Why did you change a product that worked so well. I have tried a few of your other moisturizers and none compare to your old Intensified Day moisturizer. I have been a true Neutrogena fan for over 20 years. Please bring it back!!!
"I tried this new moisturizer as a replacement to the Intensified Day Moisturizer with SPF 15. This product does not compare. Additionally, something in the ingredients irritates my eyes. I am now forced to shop outside Neutrogena after years of brand loyalty."
"After about 2 weeks of using this I'm throwing it away! It does not absorb into your skin. Instead, it sits on top and rolls up if you touch your face. I woke up one morning with my face red, sore and swollen! It looked as though I had a sunburn. I hadn't used any new products and I had not been in the sun AT ALL so I knew this product was the reason for this reaction. It's taken a week for my skin to somewhat heal. I'm very disappointed!"
"I do not like this new product at all! It does not provide the moisture that the previous product (Intensified Day Moisture) provided. And I agree with the other reviewers, I don't like the scent. I don't want to put that on my face. Can you please bring back Neutrogena Intensified Day Moisture?!!! I'm having trouble finding a face moisturizer that works as well as that one did. My face has been so dry."
"I tried this cream and my skin feels dry, even right after putting it on. With the Intensified Day Moisturizer my skin felt supple all day long. I used that product every day for over a decade. Why won't they just bring it back? PLEASE! I also don't like the scent they added to this product. I won't buy it again, and will continue to look for a replacement."
"Our whole family used the Intensive Day Moisture every day for over a decade. The new product does not measure up, and we can't stand the smell of it. We've switched to a competitor's product, but would go back to Neutrogena Intensive Day Moisture if it appeared on store shelves."
"I used Intensified Moisture for years and loved it. This replacement product ""Deep Moisture Day Cream"" doesn't measure up. The fragrance is terrible and unnecessary. The cream feels almost waxy after it is applied. It is made in Canada. Intensified Day Moisture was made in the USA."
"I used to use the 15spf, fragrance free ""intensified day moisturizer"" in the blue & white little tub, but I cannot find it any more. Is it discontinued???!!!! I tried this instead. The fragrance smelled nice, but irritated my skin. Instead of day-long moisturizer, my skin was visibly peeling and dry within 20 minutes. And, I smelled like I just went to the beach (i.e., I smelled like sunscreen, which the 15 spf moisturizer does not do). Please bring back the old moisturizer! If you don't, I'll sadly be looking elsewhere for my daily moisturizer..."
"I find this product unacceptable. It does not give the deep moisture as Intensified Day Moisturizer and, for some reason, it makes my eyes water terribly. I could be allergic to something in it. Why did you fix it when it was not broken???? Please bring back the Intensified Day Moisturizer that I used for almost 20 years. I love it and miss it."
I tried this product hoping it was just a new name for the Intensified Day Moisture Cream! Boo! It's not and I am not a fan!!! I have very dry skin that is sensitive. Within a few days my skin became itchy and irritated. It also started breaking out. And my husband commented that I smelled like sunscreen! Yuck!
"I was so excited to find this thinking it was a ""repackaged"" version of the discontinued Intensified Daily Moisture Cream. Unfortunately, it definitely is not. It is heavier, smells like sunscreen and irritates my skin. It is not even similar to Intensified Daily Moisture Cream. Neutrogena, if you will not bring IDM cream back, will you please let us know what in your line is most similar to it."
"Been a happy user of Neutrogena Intensified Day Moisture spf 15 for years. I buy by bulk and only this week discovered it had been discontinued. Tried one jar of this. Fragrance on this is not good for my allergy. Prefer the spf 15's light texture, no fragrance. Now I'm forced to shop for other brands. Good luck."
"Tried several other Neutrogena products since they stopped making the Intensified Day Moisturizer and nothing works as well. They sit on my skin and do nothing. The Intensified Day Moisturizer absorbed easily into the skin and didn't cause any eruptions. Most important of all, it was fragrance free."
I live in the desert and have used the Intensified Day Moisture SPF15 daily for many years. This product is NOT a good replacement. I have sensitive skin and allergies and will be returning this product as I can't stop sneezing from the Fragrance. Please Please Please bring back Intensified Day Moisture SPF15! For now I am going to switch to Eucerin Everyday Protection Face Lotion SPF 30.
I had used Neutrogena Intensified Daily Moisturizer for decades and was very satisfied. Have tried Deep Moisture day cream w/SPF 20 and am most disappointed in product. It does not deliver moisture - skin feels dry and cream leaves tiny white flecks on my skin. I have tried LOT0033C & LOT0013C - both leave specks of white. Bad formula? Please bring back the original Intensified Daily Moisturizer. Do not recommend this product.
"Please bring back the Intesified Day Cream, fragrance free. Nothing you have on the market right now will ever take its place. My skin care regimen is not the same. I would buy it in a heartbeat if you brought it back. I can not use anything with fragrance. I know a lot of people can't."
"I purchased this product as a replacement for the intensive day moisturizer, and was thoroughly disappointed that it is scented. When reading the ingredients, it suggests the main purpose for this product is as a sunscreen. Do you plan on providing an unscented moisturizer??"
"Was so sorry you removed the previous intensive day moisturizer from the shelves. Tried this one and my sinuses cannot tolerate the fragrance. If I keep using it, I will have a bad sinus infection within a week. Like the other reviews I'm reading here, please listen to the consumer and bring back the old formula - please, please! Toss this one in the garbage!!!"
"I used the Neutrogena Intensified Day Moisturizer for more than a decade and liked it very much. Now I can't find it so I tried the Deep Moisture Day Cream. I cannot stand the smell and I am sneezing constantly because I am allergic to fragrances. That is why I liked the Intensified Day Moisturizer. Please, please, bring it back!!!!"
"This cream is terrible, it doesn't leave the same smooth texture and natural looking glow that intensified day moisture did. Won't recommend as it is ineffective and comparable to any other off the counter moisturizer. Definitely not diferrentiable like IDM was....."
"I used Intensified Day Moisture SPF 15 for aprox. 7 yrs, found it was discontinued, and just tried this as a replacement. Some of the new ingrediants- likely the fragrance and broad spectrum sun protection are irritating (and I don't have very sensitive skin, just slightly dry). The old Day Moisture could be used under the eyes safely. This can not. Please bring back the old product:. ANYBODY IN MARKETING LISTENING?"
"I really feel that I gave this product enough time to see if it would be as good as ""Intensified Day Moisture"". It is not, I have used Neutrogena products for years and always love their products until this one. Please listen to your customers, we are the reason your product gets placed on the store shelves again and again!!"
"this new product is not good as the INTENSIFIED DAY MOISTER CREAM. This was a great cream for me. I have dry skin, and it helped me. This new cream makes my skin tight and I do not like this feeling. PLEASE BRING BACK THE INTENSIFIED DAY MOISTER CREAM. I bought a few and now I am to my last jar. Thank you...."
"I bought this product thinking that it was a replacement for the intensified day moisture and it most definitely is NOT. I used the intensified day moisture for years and years. I don't wear makeup, and it made my skin feel great all day, even in air conditioned office environments. This new product makes my skin feel tight and uncomfortably dry within 1/2 hour of putting it on. In fact,. my skin felt more moist before I put it on. Please bring back the old product. I was buying it up for a while to hoard it but I've used most of it up."
"Have used Neutrogena Intense Day Moisturizer for years and always get compliments on how young I look. Could not find it anymore so bought the Deep Moisture Day Cream and immediately felt a burning sensation on my skin. It's now red, dry and blotchy....I can't use anything on my skin until this heals. Please bring back the Intense Day Moisturizer....it was a wonderful product."
"i have faithful, loyal user of Intensified Day Moisture for years. Most people guess me to be at least 10 years younger than I am. I was extremely disappointed when I couldn't find it on the shelf. I purchased the Deep Moisture Day Cream. it burned my faced and has dried it out. I don't know why you would take such a wonderful product off the market. Please bring it back."
"I have been using Deep Moisture day cream for over 2 decades and still love it! The sunscreen is a life-saver in our sunny location, and is not heavy at all. Although I am getting older, my skin is still soft and clear and people usually think I am much younger than I am. I am allergic to many cosmetics, but have never had a problem with Neutrogena products."
I bought this by mistake because I really liked the Night cream in this version. I did not realize this one does not blend with skin it just looks like dried up sunscreen and i have to rub it off to get the flakes off. Hard to explain but it doesn't work. And the kicker is I paid in cash and threw away receipt so have no way to exchange
I have rosacea so was very leary of trying this product because of the negative reviews. I am so happy that I tried it anyway. My skin loves this moisturizer. Winter is the worst time of year for me but I think this product will help me get through it. Please continue to carry this great procuct.
I have been using neutrogena products for years and was always getting compliments about my skin. Then I couldn't get the Intensified Day Cream anymore and my skin changed! The Deep moisture cream you are trying to get us to switch to is completely useless and instantly burns my skin and causes irritation and huge discomfort. Please please bring back the Intensified day moisture cream!
I am very disappointed in this product. I started using it a couple of weeks ago and has made my face skin look and feel WORSE! I have dry patches all over my face and I look at least 5 years older. I also see wrinkles around my eyes I hadn't seen before I began using this cream. Yikes! Not recommended at all!
"I am nearing the end of my supply of Intensified Day Moisturizer--nothing can take its place. I am always receiving compliments about my skin and how young I look. I always answer it is because of Neutrogena and the Intensified Day Moisturizer and the Light Night Cream. I have used them for as long as I can remember and now I am really worried that without the one that has been discontinued my skin will change, Please please bring it back - how will I be able to recommend Neutrogena without it."
I have been using this product and the Deep Moisture Night Cream for one week and it is not working for me. This morning when I put my make up on over it I had beads of moisturizer rolling off my skin. I don't know what is wrong with this but I really prefer your old intensified day moisture product and the light night cream. Please make the day moisture again. I have used Neutrogena products all my life and am so disappointed.
I am well past 60 years old; I have been using this product since I was in my early 30s. I believe this product has helped save my skin and keep it younger looking. I tell everyone who complains about their skin to use Neutrogena products. I love them; and I am a believer in the effectiveness of this product. I have minimal brown spots and lines in my skin thanks to this product. I'm warding off changes with this product. There are some but my skin is much better than it would be without this product.
"I've a very sensitive skin, I've tried all brands and finally a friend of mine gave me this cream and I love it! Unfortunatelly I live in México City and I can't find it, they sell Neutrogena but not this product...I wish you cold tell me where I can find it Thanks"
"Not able to find Ageless Intensives Deep Wrinkle Moisture, I purchased this product since the ingredients were almost identical. Terribly disappointed as it is heavily scented, greasy in texture and not compatible with strong exertion outdoors (gets in eyes when perspiring and stings.) BRING BACK THE AGELESS INTENSIVES DEEP WRINKLE MOISTURE.....PLEASE!!!!!"
I love neutrogenar stuff but this cream did not do it for me. I applied it and it went on great but after 30 min my skin was dry and peeling. Changed to another neutrogenar moisturizer that works with my skin. Oil-Free Moisture - Combination Skin this worked.
"I purchased because I trust the Neutrogena name. I have never had an adverse reaction to a moisturizer or make-up. Although my face for the past five days feels dry, flaky and has a slightly razed rash and honestly hurts. I didnt want to believe it was the moisturizer so I kept applying it, just seems to make it worse and drier. Burns on application especially if I have just washed my face. A bit disappointed."
"I have been a loyal Neutrogena customer for 10 years and have used many of their spf moisturizers. This one is currently the perfect one for me. I have dry skin and this is moisturizing enough for the day and also soaks right in and provides a very smooth application for my make up. I also use the night cream version of this. Together, they help keep my face moisturized without making my skin too oily or greasy. Win!"
Great day time moisturizer. Absorbed well and quickly. Makeup goes on great over it and my face feels nourished and never greasy. I like the SPF in it. My skin is so delicate that I must be really careful with ingredients. No problems with this cream. Will be ordering more of it as needed. Also will be buying other anti- aging products and makeup from Neutrogena!
"This lotion is the best I've used. I love that it includes sunscreen to block the sun's harmful rays and that it still feel light enough to prime my face before starting my makeup! I've read other online reviews that talked about it clumping up after applying foundation - but, I have not found this to be true at all. But, this could also be because I use Neutrogena foundation as well. Nevertheless, I have been impressed and have used this lotion for many, many years!"
"This used titanium dioxide for the SPF protection which is proven to safe and effective by the FDA. This has saved my face a few times... I've been burnt over the rest of my body, but my face was spared! It is lightweight, it moisturizes well, and it absorbs quickly. No greasy feeling."
I love this face cream. It doesn't leave that nasty greasy feeling it absorbs quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"There are very few creams that you can use near your eyes that have SPF protection. This cream is gentle, you can use it under and over your lid, and it has SPF 20 protection. Fantastic."
Use less to cream to allow it to absorb and prevent losing the effect/white pile up of product. It moisturizes without greasiness and leaves a healthy grow after application. Light fragrance is great.
I bought this and my eyes started burning after a few hours of putting it on. My eyes do not burn if I don't wear it at all. It does soften and moisten your face though.
I cannot find intense moisturizer which I had used for years and loved. Please bring it back. I have switched to another brand hoping to get similar results that I received with your discontinued product.....
I purchased this product because they discontinued the intensive moisture day cream. This product is terrible. I wish they would bring back the other cream. I used it for years. Now I am switching to another brand.
"IDM was the best. It didn't irritate but moisturized like satin. Deep Moisture is comparable to other heavy creams. If you have sensitive skin, be careful with this."
I thought this product is the same as the Day Time Moisturizer but very disappointed on the result. I don't understand why Neutragena discontinue the best product they have. I hope they will bring it back.
"I have used this cream three times now and it doesn't absorb well, and if I rub my face at all, even gently, it pills up and some of my skin comes off with it.... awful and uncomfortable. Will not buy again."
This stuff is not an acceptable substitute. Perhaps you could recommend another company that makes a similar product to your original Intensified Moisture Cream SP15.
"I'm am so disappointed with this product. I have dry skin and this doesn't feel moisturizing enough and face looks chalky after use. I also had some burning issues in sensitive areas, looks like sunburn making fine lines look deeper."
"I have the same issue some of other reviewers have - cream just doesn't absorb, it dries on the surface of the skin and if you run your finger over your face it just rolls into white substance."
"I bought this moisturizer for the sunscreen protection and deep moisturizing qaulities. When I use the moisturizer without makeup, it leaves a white residue and when I use it under foundation it pills up in small balls."
"I am a new Neutrogena customer. I love this product. Have been using it for 2 weeks. I love he texture and feel of this cream. I use it on my face, neck and hands. I am very pleased with the product. My husband uses it as well!"
"My skin is soft and moisturized all day. Liquid foundations look ""pasty"" on my skin, but this moisturizer and my loose face powder gives me a fresh dewy look. I've found the scent to be light and not at all bothersome. And I've had no breakouts."
PLEASE BRING BACK the Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration cream in the tube - SPF 25. This was your best product ever and is superior to this one!
Ive bought and used this everyday for a month to give it a fair shot and I HATE it! Its good when it first goes on but about 5 minutes after i put it on i cant rub my face or it will crumble off my face. Its so weird and makes applying my make up difficult so sad because I love the night cream
Great value [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a very good everyday moisturizer. It has SPF and it leaves skin soft and smooth. I have normal to dry sensitive skin, and it does not irritate. I wish it was a bit more moisturizing though, I'm not sure if it will be enough moisture in the winter months."
"I saw all the negative reviews, and had to post one that was more positive. I LOVE this face cream, and it's the only one I use for the day. I like that it's lightweight, and I also, given that I live in DC where the sun can get super intense, very much appreciate the SPF 20. I've also had no problems with the cream causing breakouts or anything like that, which is not the case with some other skin creams. I have sensitive combination skin, and this stuff works really well for me."
"This formula is great for my oily/dehydrated skin. The moisture keeps my skin hydrated and I love that it has SPF. Towards the end of the day my face can look a bit oily (without makeup on) but I just leave it and/or use blotting papers (most moisturizers have this effect on me anyway). Unlike many of the reviews on here, I have no problem putting makeup on top of this moisturizer."
Every other lotion I have tried has irritate my skin but not this one. It makes my skin soft and even without irritation.
The fragrance in this new product is disgusting! I have been using the IDM for about 10 years and I am so sad that it is no longer available.
Bring back the intensified day cream you had before it is smoother and feels softer this new one is dry and make my face feel bad
should be discontinued. doesnt fix my problem just makes my face look mre dry and flaky. i will love my money back. very disappointed!!!!
No bueno!!! It rolls off like a product made for sloughing off dead skin and gets all over!! I'm returning it!
I have used Neutrogena products all my life but this moisturizer is just now up to standard. It doesnt even moisturize well and my skin feels irritated.
What's with the standards in Canada?there is nothing to find instead..even in cheapest creams I didn't see Parabens long time in USA already..and price is the same like as organic creams..I'm upset now that I was useing it..
"I'm 73, have dry skin, and thought this would be just the thing for my skin. No. My skin ended up looking dry, and scaly with even more wrinkles after using this."
"Really good price, creamy and light, good coverage."
I have used Neutrogena Day Moisturizer and Night Moisturizer for at least 20 years and LOVE IT. I was fortunate to inherit good skin and Neutrogena has helped me keep it that way. I am 86.
I have always had dry skin and not all the face creams works for me... too greasy or too dry! And this neutrogena day cream is AMAZING!! It's the balance to give me a soft and glowing skin with no side effects!
"I've been using this product for years and I've never experienced any negative reaction. I appreciate the sun protection it provides, as well using it as a daily facial moisturizer."
Very good
"I recently started using this product that purchased for a local pharmacy. I am very sad for the money I spend on this product. It does not absorb to this skin, it claims"
"""intensely moisturizing Without a Heavy, Greasy Feel"" that was Falls. it cakes on top of one face with very heavy feeling. I normally like Neutrogena product in my beauty regime but unfortunately this product was disappointing"
"I've been using this product along with the night cream version for a few weeks now and I'm pleased with the results. However, like some of your reviewers, I experienced a bit of the ""white residue"" issue the first few times I applied the cream. What I found is that this isn't an issue as long as my skin is completely dry after cleansing and I don't apply too much."
I bought this product for the Neutrogena name. The first thing I noticed is that the product doesn't sink into the skin it seems to gunk up like an exfoliator would do leaving my skin raw. I can't put make up on top of it because it just becomes one rolled up mess.
I love how this moisturizer soothes my dry skin. Unfortunately it leaves a white cast and Peels terribly.
"I came form using Murad's moisturizer. This is a great alternative, and a fraction of the price! Highly recommend!"
"I bought this day cream for sun protection and for dry skin after using accutane. I love this jar of moisture. My skin stays soft all day and my skin is not oily, dry, or breaking out- it's inexpensive too. Will be using this everyday!!!"
"Oddly, when I put this on in the morning, by 4pm my expression lines around my mouth are much deeper! It feels all right going on, isn't too greasy, but it does not seem to be moisturizing at all. I've only been using it a few days but I've never seen lines like this before, or had a product seem to have such a negative effect. I'm disappointed ... I am usually pretty happy with Neutrogena products and buy them because they live up to their claims. But what this cream does is scary!"
"hi Nutrogena... I've been using the Deep Moisture Body Cream (with that cocoa scent) for over 4 years... I don't live in the US but lived there once and meet that wonderful product, now, I went to the US to make some shopping and didn't find the product in stores nor on line (in a descent price) I'm guessing you discontinued it... please let me know which one should I look for now."
I bought this and the night cream. I put the day spf moisturizer on got the beads and had to wash off. My face was covered in beads. So I put the night cream on and my face felt strange and my eyes were watering all day and I couldn't wash my face at work. I have been using Ultra Gentle Daily Cleanser for sensitive skin and was amazed with it. I was hoping these would be good moisturizers but they were horrible.
"Similar to"" Intensified Day Moisture"" (which is fragrance free) but with a slightly higher spf. Would like it much better if Fragrance Free and higher (35-50) spf!"
Works wonders on my skin! Doesn't leave a greasy feeling like some products do. I have sensitive and oily skin and this product has not made me break out! I finally found the one!
I've been using this on my face each morning for several weeks now and my skin feels soft and my pores have decreased in size even my wrinkles have diminished. I'm 63 years old with slightly dry skin. I will by this product again.
"Unless you've very dry skin, this is one of the best moisturizers on the market. It has no greasy feel, absorbs quickly and works great with make-up."
