I've been using Clinique's Dramatically Different Moisturizing Gel every day for nearly eight years. Small amounts go a long way. It's extremely light but moisturizes very effectively without clogging your pores. I use this along with Clinique's toner and I don't see myself changing my skincare routine anytime soon. This is a product I recommend to all my friends whenever they're looking to upgrade their moisturizer.
Great for daily use. It spreads easily and absorbs instantly. I use it as an aftershave moisturizer as well.
Clinique Dramatically ...Diff Moisture Gel is the second thing I apply every day... to my face after showering. The first is 50% protection from Skin Cancer/Sun damage!
"Product is great , price was great. Customer care was a little iffy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I rarely write reviews on here, but after trying more than 10 moisturizers and finally finding THE ONE, I just had to. I have seriously oily skin"
My go-to moisteriser!
Only lotion I can use that doesn't make me break out or get to oily.
I've been using this for years! It's great for my oily skin.
"I've been using this for a few weeks only (started with a sample) so it's too soon to give it 5 stars; however, since I've started using it, my skin is softer, more dewy, stays hydrated all the time, even after sweating at the gym, so I think its going to be a keeper. Walmart service/delivery was excellent!"
"Itâs fake. The moisturizer I got smells like cinnamon? Also, it did not come with the box."
Excellent product
This is great for daily moisturizer that isn't too greasy - perfect for the summer.
