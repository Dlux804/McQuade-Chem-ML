"This product has the same ingredients as ""designer ""creams that sell for four hundred dollars. By using the supplement pill form of the cream ingredients I make it even more effective. The results are that in my 70's not a week goes by without someone asking what I do to have such great skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for years (ever since I first tried it). Some people say it ""tingles"" on the skin; I haven't found that. But it has firmed and smoothed my skin and taken away most of my age spots. I think my skin looks better than many women many years younger than me. Now if I could just find a product that would help me be as successful at losing weight...."
"I received this moisturizer as a birthday gift and I absolutely love it. I was told it was purchased from Target. When I checked there to purchase it was sold out. So of course I checked Walmart and while it was not sold in stores it was over $8 cheaper, the shipping was free, arrived within a week and came in a nice glass jar (the Target purchase came in a plastic jar). I am extremely pleased!"
Excellent moisturizer with no animal ingredients! I have been using this for two months and my skin is softer to the touch and looks more radiant than it has in years.
Great Product. I've noticed a difference in my skin tone
"This is my favorite nighttime cream! The smell is so soothing and the richness of the cream is my favorite. I am not sure if it really firms, but I will buy again just for the richness and moisturizing effect of the lotion plus the smell!"
"This product had all the ingredients I was looking for in one face cream. Some of the reviews complained about the smell but I didn't notice anything unpleasant. You can feel it working with a light tingling. I love that it is paraben, petrolatum, dye and cruelty free. I would buy again."
"I like this product for the price, natural ingredients, and does moisturize well. Smooths on easily with a very light scent."
"But this is WONDERFUL. I saw the importance of DMAE on Dr, Oz, and pulled out this cream which I previously purchased. I have been using it for a couple of weeks, and LOVE it. I can see a difference, and a cashier couldn't believe I was as old as I am. I heard that before, but she almost made me pull out my ID to purchase wine."
"Purchased derma e as a supplement to Coenzyme Q-10 and it is amazing what it has done to my face and neck.. My neck was like turkey skin and is becoming firm. I only purchased 1 jar but will definately purchase more when this is used. I use the product after the Co Q-10 serum daily on my face, neck and back. A little goes a long way. The CoQ10 has a citrus smell and just love it!"
"This is some of the best cream I have ever used! It seems like it peels off the top layer of my skin, in a sense, because it tingles. It looks and smells kind of like oatmeal, which is more natural than most of the products I have used before. You only have to use very little and you can feel it on your skin for a while, although it's not oily-like. The price is less than I've seen in other places, too!"
"I received the Derma E Firming with DMAE CLEANSER, TONER, SERUM AND THIS MOISTURIZER TODAY. I am beyond thrilled. In two uses my face looks healthier and is glowing! My huge pores are tiny! I can't wait to see how great my skin looks after a week! The best change from my normal Clinique regime EVER!"
"I am currently using the whole line of Derma-e skin care products offered by Puritans Pride. I am very pleased with this one. It is a very rich cream full of good ingredients for your facial skin. It may seem a bit heavy in the summer, but it absorbs easily moisturizing the skin and actually firming it without any greasy feeling. DMAE is highly recommended for mature skin. It has a smell that is not strong but kind of yummy and natural. Love this product the most of all the Derma-e line."
"stumbled upon this cream because Dr. Oz said on his show that DMAE is essential in an anti aging cream because it actually works. What an unbelievably terrific cream and at an affordable price. Nice not to pay for fluff; glossy ads, slick packaging etc. I think my skin looks 10 years younger when I use this every day. Forehead wrinkles are not noticeable anymore. My skin looks lifted and overall toned. I'm 50 but been told I look 40. I liked this so much I just placed an order for the serum and cleanser. Love it!!! Thanks!"
"This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. It absorbs quickly and leaves my face soft and smooth without any oily shine. Compared to other products I have used it is not only the most efffective, but also a great value. I just ordered another jar and also the eye cream and the serum."
"My wife has been using this cream for about 2 years and this is the one she likes the best. I could notice the difference in her younger appearance and other people started complementing her, even our kids. I started using this cream after seeing what it was doing for her. I just placed an order for a back up today, by the way we are both in our early 70's."
"I've been using Derma E for a few months now, and in that time I've turned 50. The landmark birthday had me taking a closer than usual look at myself in the mirror, and I started to notice a change in the fine lines around my eyes especially. Then my next door neighbor couldn't stop staring at me, and finally said ""your skin looks so young!"" and I knew it wasn't just my imagination. I have always used lotions and taken good care of my skin, but I believe this really is making a true difference."
"There are many skin care/anti aging products on the market that can not only be high priced, but also lack the potency of this cream. If you are looking for a product that delivers results, you've found it here. I have used it often and all over to keep my skin looking young. If you use this product, along with vitamins and sunscreen, your skin will certainly benefit from Derma E even more. You will not find a more effective item on the market at such a great price- and honestly, I can't live without this stuff!"
This is a wonderful product. Although I must say they have changed it by adding a stinky fragrance. I had used this for years but stopped because of the fragrance. Why do we have to have fragrance in everything? Please go back to the original ingredients!
"I watch Dr. Oz almost every day. He recomended DMAE Capsules for anti aging. When I ordered them, I noticed there was cream as well. I thought it's worth trying. Well I am glad I did. I love the cream, it is not greasy and feels refreshing after cleansing your face for the night. I am 80 years old, and hey ladies it works."
"I recently bought a set of face creams from Dr. Perricone and it was quite expensive. It contained the DMAE also, but it actually made me break out and it smelled awful! But this cream has made my skin so soft and clear and bright with no bad smell. It does have a scent that some may not like, but i don't mind. It absorbs quickly so I don't have to worry about putting my Bare Escentuals on right afterwards! Love it!"
"I'm late in life to using any face products. Decided to try a few. This product seems to be making my face smoother, brighter, I hate to use the word younger, but perhaps that's where I am going. :-) Just began first container, used about 2 weeks, feel there is a difference. I will try it through the winter to see the overall presentation. I also began taking Collagen Beauty formula liquid at night for same time. Thought they would work together. Would rate higher but don't know the long term use yet."
My skin looks and feels better. Seems to be also evening out the color in my face as well. Pores also seem to be shrinking. The only negative is that the cream has darkened in color. I decided to put in the fridge. Not sure if that made a difference but the color hasn't darkened and the coolness feels good.
"Together with the Hyaluronic night cream it is the best cream an older woman can find on the market and the price is great also, will recommend it to all my friends !"
"I was really surprised with the consistency of the face cream. Its very silky and rich and a little goes a long way. My skin feels great, it absorbs really well and is good under make up. Love the way it makes my skin feel. Very supple!"
"This product worked as well, if not better than, any of the so called higher end, chemically laded products that I used. I saw a noticeable difference in my skin in a short period of time. It is also less expensive and a bargain from Puritan."
"I thought I would try Derma E DMAE daily cream just for the summer. But recently bought my second jar because I notice a change in my skin! Also, two friends have asked me what I have been doing differently."
I love Derma E Ester creme. I have purchased it before a couple times and will always use it. It makes my skin so soft and radiant. I will never use anything else. Great quality and great prices.
This is a really excellent product that keeps my face hydrated and has significantly reduced the visibility of fine lines around my eyes and mouth. Much better product for the money than most brand names.
I use this every morning under makeup. It absorbs into the skin quickly and has no odor.
I have been buying this product for several years and was very satisfied but now my last order I received had a lavender fragrance added to it. It is a strong odor and I do not buy items for my skin with any kind of fragrance to it. I am very disappointed that this was added to this product. There are many people that do not like fragrances do to being unhealthy for you. People need to understand that some fragrances are unhealthy and should not be used just because it smells good to you.
I've been using this product for about 6 months and I am very satisfied with the results. The texture of my skin has improved quite a bit. A few reviews I've seen are not happy with the fragrance. I would agree when you first open it the fragrance is noticeable but it does dissipate. I actually use this mostly at night before bedtime and the benefits make up for the smell.
"I had used a prominent skin doctor's very expensive similar product at a much higher price -- this is just as effective and a lot cheaper. The first time I used it I found the smell slightly off putting. However, each subsequent time I purchased it, the smell improved. In fact this last one I am now using has a lavender smell. The product goes on easily and has definitely improved the appearance of my skin. I shall continue to buy this from Swanson as I do buy all of my vitamins and supplements."
"I purchased this item for my mom - it looked promising from the item's description. It's not an anti-aging/wrinkle product it's just a cream/moisturizer. I am about to re-purchase a different item she tried before that she does recommend - Wrinkle Cream With DMAE & CoQ10. I'd say give them both a try and see the results for yourself, since each individual reacts differently. Have a wrinkle free day!"
"please read my reviews of Derma E Cleaner & Toner, as I use the products together; I suspect only this way you can get the most of them. This cream is perfect as it's easy to apply, leaves your skin soft and nurtured. But I do have an objection to it and it is regarding it's smell. It's very unpleasant and hard to get used to. I didn't reject this moisturiser this time as it's exellent in all other questions, but I'll think twice if I'll purchase it next time."
"Ihave been using this cream for about 6 months. From the 1st time I applied it, my skin felt great and I feel like it has helped with the fine linesaround my eyes and lips! I tend to have breakout prone skin however this has never made me breakout! The only downside is the ""skunk like"" smell. Works perfectly! Must have this always!"
I have used this cream for about 3 years and love it. It makes my face feel smooth and refreshed. It causes a tingly sensation when first applied causing my skin to become pink. This dissappears after about 10 minutes. I do notice a difference in my fine lines and wrinkles and the skin on my neck feels and looks more taunt. I would recommend this product most definitely!
Visible difference in just 4 weeks. My skin feels great and it now glows. Have tried other products and this is the best ever.
This moisturizer is a great value at a fair price. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin soft and smooth without a greasy feel.
"Love this product, noticed a difference in my neckline with in a few days. i will purchase more before this jar runs out!"
"This cream is heaven to put on, This will be a on going purchase for me from puritans pride. Thank you!"
I have been using this for years after seeing on Dr. Oz that DMAE is one of the best wrinkle defense therapies. Results are amazing!
Smooths on easily and absorbs with no greasy feeling. Seems to work also as a good pfimer/moisturizer before applying makeup.
"I have gone through 2 jars of this cream in the last year. I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cream. I just started using it with a serum - DMAE Firming Fluid during the day and Hyaluronic Acid serum at night. I have experienced outstanding results."
I have been using this product every night at bedtime and am pleased with the overall effects. I also put it on my husband who is a site foreman in the FL sun every day and am equally pleased with the results.
I have used this cream before but ran out. I re-ordered it and have been using it for one week now. I like that it's absorbs quickly and leaves no oily residue. It leaves my skin look velvety. Already noticed reduced pore size and better skin tone. The last time I used it for 6 weeks and noticed a reduction in fine line and wrinkle prominence. This cream really works better compared to creams 3-4 times the price. The added bonus is that it's natural. I'm really impressed. ( My 1st review ever!)
"MMMMMMM this feels great. And after almost a month using it I swear i can see the difference on my neck and chest. Smells nice too. Someone asked me the other day if I had some ""work done"" and I have not thank you! Maybe its this cream! give it a try...it feels great anyway."
"i have been using this cream now for approx. one month. my skin was getting visibly drier day by day. this cream has bought a plumpness back which was slowly disappearing. i also notice it's a lot brighter than it's been for a long time. the wrinkles i have are not as prominent as they used to be, and the texture is better. i can only hope that it keeps improving daily. overall i'm very pleased with this product, and price. a great buy."
"I have tried every expensive brand natural (and some un-natural) face cream out there, and this modestly priced cream is the only one I have ever bought a second time. it is not greasy, does not hurt my eyes, has helped reduce redness and fine lines, and makes my skin look and feel great!"
"I love this lotion as it is light weight and absorbs quickly. I purchased originally because of the ingredients. The jar, while being small, last me much longer than I thought it would. I am on my second jar and I anticipate ordering again in the future. I cannot say I can see a difference in my skin since I started using it but I do feel good about the ingredients."
Been using this creme for years. It was dermatologist recommended. Nothing feels better on my face!
"Very happy with the results I see, using this line of products."
Secret in a bottle-I love this stuff and have recommended it to friends!
helps keep me wrinkle free! I'm 60 and get complements all the time. I know this helps!
"This is a midweight cream that feels nice on the skin. Not too heavy, just right for me. Not really crazy about the scent but it is doable."
"Been using for about a month, I like it. I'am seeing improvement in my skin. My Mom has even tried it, she's probably going to get some more."
This is my new Must Have! My skin feels great and is looking much better. I only wish it came in a bigger jar!
"I like this cream, the odor of the cream is fresh and it feels a little tingly after you apply it. I like the jar because you get to use all the cream from the bottom of the jar. As with some creams in tubs or pumps you can never get to the bottom of it. I can see after a month or so of use that the wrinkles seem a little more fine and the skin is soft! Would definitely buy this cream again...."
I don't believe there's a finer face cream anywhere. I've used expensive face creams for years but have settled on this one as one to stay with. I especially like that it's in a jar and you can use all of it. I can feel and see the difference in my skin.
"Love this stuff. First I had tried Reviva Labs' version, but found out there was vegetable oil in it. DermaE is way better. I can even use it under my eyes, and every department store eye cream usually burns my under eye area. At 31 years old, it's never too early to start anti-aging creams. My mom commented about how much better my eyes and skin looked with this stuff. And the price is awesome: Swanson's is great!"
"I used this product a while back when on a 40 day juice fast and my skin looked so good. I thought it was more the fast than the product, but recently started using this again as my pores were getting very enlarged on my face. Within days there was dramatic improvement. Now, 2 weeks later I can see such a difference-I look much younger. I will never be without this product again. I'm ordering now!"
Waste of money and shipping....wish that I didn't rely on previous reviews instead of my own experience. But this is a review that you can trust.
"Has a very unpleasant odor, don't know why because other Derma E products do not. Love the firming serum, but can't get past the smell on this one."
"I like the texture and feel of this product, however; I have not used it a lot because it has an odd smell that I just do not like."
We have been using this product for several months and have seen a noticable difference in our skin. My wife and I both use it.
I truly prefer the Derma E products. They're pure and effective. I use Firming DMAE Moisturizer daily over Deep Wrinkle Peptide Serum or Firming DMAE serum. It works for me.
"I have used products in the past that has the same ingredients as this one, but my skin did not do well with this one. Also, the smell of this cream was terrible; I don't know maybe I received a bad jar where an ingredient went bad."
This product is a great value! I've seen this at a local health food store for twice as much. This product is great because the ingredients are natural unlike some other face products on the market. It works too!
"I have given this product to my daughter who has very dry skin. My skin is oily and breaks out from too much oil, which was the problem I had with this product. My daughter loves it, for her very dry skin."
"Been using this cream for about a month ,my skin looks great!!!! Works better than anything I've tried.Will reorder this product.Luv it, really works!!"
"I don't use this product for my face, however, I do use it for my neck and it leaves it soft and smooth. It does tingle a little bit, but it's not overpowering and that little jar has gone a long way."
I read that DMAE is good for your skin. I take this and the vitamin from swanson. I can tell a difference and the price was much better than any other vitamin website.
"This product was not for me, but GF said she loves it."
"This product worked great, I have sensitive skin and it was no problem. will reorder."
This is well worth the money. It's an excellent moisturizer and I will purchase again.
Have never been disappointed with a Derma e product.
Smooth and seemingly effective after many moths of use.
I have noticed results and will buy agian.
"My skin seems firmer, skin around eyes seem & firmer & eyes appear wider. Moisturizes nicely"
"I believe this is a good product, however, with my sensitive skin it caused a skin breakout. I had to discontinue using it."
This cream gives you the results it claims to. Reasonable priced for a great product. Be sure to use it for a good time period to see that it works.
"this cream not only that the ingredient is really powerful! DMAE, ALA, Vitamin C, E, etc......it's also full of nutrition that what your face really needed. it's take me at least 5 years off my face! =D"
Left my face and neck very dry and not firm.
I did not like this product. Did not do as advertised.
I returned this product for a refund.
This is a easily absorbed product I like the feel non greasy I see little signs it works but then again I don't use it every day like I should
The creme is smooth and light but not money well spent. Very disappointed with this product.
