This ream is very effective with any minor abrasions or skin irritations. I am very pleased with the product.
I use this on my face every night and really like it. I do not break out like I do with most moisturizers. Great quality and value.
This creme is good for so many things. I use it everyday.
Best moisturizer I have ever used.
"It is good cream and works well. I've tried it on a bruise and the bruise healed in a matter of days.. There is an odor to it that goes away after a while; however it is there. I do wish I had known there was an odor. I might then not have bought the cream, but rather another Derma E product."
