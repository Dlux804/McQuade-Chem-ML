"This cream is very moisturizing, yet not greasy. It absorbs quickly. I am very happy with this product. It is excellent!"
"I have very dry, very sensitive skin. This is incredible stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am 68 yrs. young and so happy that I found this product! I first saw it on Dr. OZ and a dermatologist said that this was really better than anything else out there on the market, so I tried it and will use this FOREVER! I put it on first thing in the morning after cleansing and it makes every thing after that go on smoothly and flawlessly. Swanson out prices anywhere else!"
"This is comparable to a high-end luxury line Retinol cream. The scent is beautiful, but not offensive for facial use. The moisture mantle is present overnight, and my skin is in the VERY DRY 50+ category. No irritation for my sensitive skin type. Will have to continue use for longterm results on wrinkles. but immediate softening is very present after short term use. Will buy again."
Great product and doesn't cause breakouts [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Sorry for my bad english. It's the first time that I use Derma E and I was very surprise... it's a really good product at a low price. I see already the result on my skin. I will order this product again.
"This is a good product. It is not too thick, so I use it both in the morning and evening. It goes on well underneath make-up, and does not cause break-out due to heavy oils. It is light-weight and a great value."
See no results so far....
Best cream I have ever used. Been using for a couple of months and am seeing results the expensive creams never produced. Absorbs right away and leaves skin feeling wonderful. It also doesn't have the the toxic fillers a lot of products use. After seeing my results my boyfriend is using it too. Highly recommended.
"I've used this cream for over 5 years, it's the only cream that doesn't break my skin out. My skin always feels soft and hydrated"
"I have been using this product for a few years now every night as a part of my skincare routine and I love it!! It is light, and natural absorbs into the skin rapidly. Love that it is in a jar, no waste. Great value compared to other products like this and has very few ingredients which I like. I believe less is more in skincare products. I will continue to use this as long as it is available."
This cream is great as it's not greasy and keeps my face moist.
"It goes on nice and thick and really moisturizes your skin. My only down side is that it smells funny, almost like melted crayons."
I have been using this face creme for years. You could not get me to switch. It actually makes your skin very soft and really helps reduce wrinkles. It is extremely affordable.
"Best Vitamin A cream I have tried. What attracted me to it was - 4 ounces instead of 2. Just like another product I tried for the first time, I believe with continued use, I will be able to rate this one 5 stars all around."
"This product is amazing. After 2 weeks of use could tell a big difference in my skin. My friends also noticed my skin was healthier and better. They asked what I was doing and I told them about this product. It does work, smells great and the price is right."
"I have used other face creams and they make my face break out. I have stopped using any face cream, but now that I am getting older I thought I would try this face cream. WOW I don't have the breakouts on my face like before with no face cream so I am totally impressed. Only been using a couple of weeks and seeing some results. You don't need much as it goes along way. It does have an odd smell at first but not bad enough to stop using it. I suggest you try."
"After a couple of days of using Derma cream I noticed a big difference in my skin, the way the skin looked and felt. I use it on my face and neck. The cream is very light and feels good on the skin. I use it day and night. I use to buy expensive department store cosmetics now I don't have to. This cream is wonderful!"
"This cream is nice and thick. It absorbs well, but still may be better suited for winter or night time. It has a strong rose smell when you first put it on, but that fades quickly. Makes my skin really soft, and a little goes a long way, this 4oz will last forever!"
"I've been using this about 2 weeks, and cannot honestly say I see reduction in fine lines, etc. But it is a wonderfully scented creme, very smooth. It reminds me of older cold creme-type preparations, but not greasy. Takes a little longer to absorb than the other Derma E's night creme I was using. I like it, but not sure if I will reorder. Retin A products take time to work, so will continue because I really LOVE Derma E products."
I like this cream but it still has some unnatural chemicals.
This is a great product. It leave my skin soft and I've noticed that my color is more even. Great value for the size of the jar.
I'm 65 and used to have very oily skin when younger but has dried out with age. This is excellent at restoring suppleness to aging skin!!---I apply at night to just cleaned skin and it feels amazing---love it----you will too!! : )
I am happy with this product and it is non greasy. I usually put it on twice a day. Swanson also has a face cream that I like too and I put that on after this one is absorbed in the morning before using make-up.
This face cr√®me comes in a great 4oz size ! It goes on smooth and creamy and really soaks in fast. It leaves a smooth finish that really lets make-up glide on ! I would recommend it as a great moisturizer for anyone !
"Love the cream, didn't expect it to be so large but great value! the cream itself is wonderful. I use it at night (rotating with other products). In the morning my skin looks glowy. It is a little heavy so great for dry skin or winter."
"I was surprised by the size of the cream's container. Expecting smaller...moisturizer's very well, but I was hoping that some of my wrinkles would completely vanish."
"There's no real decent amount of ""D"" or ""E"" - so I'm gong to return this jar, unopened, and go back to using another company's cream, whose formulation includes these vitamins, along with the main ingredient vitamin. That's not to say there's something wrong with this product, it's just not the one I thought it was."
I wish it does not have soy oil.
I found something that works better than my expensive cream. I will never stop using this cream. My skin feels great!!!
have been using this product for a few years. It is very light and has a great feel and last longer than most products
I really like this facial crime. It is a rich thick lotion that easily absorbed into the skin. A great value.
I have used this for a few weeks now and love the way it has smoothed out my complection. Feels very soft and smooth when applied-love it!!
My wife has been using this creme morning and night for nearly two years and likes the way it moistens her skin.
This is avery nice moisturizing cream. I haven't noticed any reduction in fine lines but it leaves your skin feeling very nice.
"Really like this cream...the way it goes on, no smell, definitely works !!"
Great product. No allergic reaction. Excellent value.
good cream w/vit a. using it on face and hands and arms w/good results. fair price. good product.
"Works very well, especially in the winter climate. It might be too heavy for summer."
I like Derma-e products because they are free of parabens and other artificial ingredients.
I mix this with Derma E's Ester-C cream and it is so moisturizing and makes my skin look great!!!
