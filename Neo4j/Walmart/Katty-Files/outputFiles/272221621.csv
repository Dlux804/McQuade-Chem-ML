"Kiss Red E Dark Spot Corrector Creme has really impressed me! Not only is it wholesome, organic and vegan, it's made in the US! It has lightened my dark spots and helped to even my skin tone. I actually think my skin is more radiant after using the corrector creme. It's light and creamy and it doesn't take very much to do the job. It's a GREAT buy!"
I always look for dark spot corrector. I have acne and especially the dark spot. I have use Makeup to hide my dark spot but luckily a friend of mine recommended me this product. Im using it for about 2-3 weeks and I am amazed with the results. I would definitely recommend it.
This product is AMAZING!!!! I've always struggled with acne and especially dark spots and this really helped me. It's really easy to use and it did wonders in my skin
I really love using this. It is light and creamy. Easy to spread. You dont need much to use. A little does goes a long way. It leaves my skin soft and smooth
Excellent one . It worked great on my skin to remove dark spot and feel the skin so soft. Its worth to get it. Felt amazing after using it and i really loved it.
"The first product I purchased with this brand is its eye cream and was really amazing so, I confidently purchased this product. And alas, they're a great duo! I like how it is made with natural products and contrary to the usual products in the market, this is an all around product I can use in any part of my body. The spots in my hands and neck are lightened and diminishing! Not only that, it helps soften my skin! Affordable, and great quality. It is a cream but its not greasy. It sinks perfectly in to the skin."
Wow I have tried a lot of dark spot products with NO results--but I can see this product is really going work.
It's magical cream for my face it cleared all my dark spot on my face and it great for my sensitive skin. I do recommend this product
Kiss Red E is the most awesome brand. It never makes me feel weird. It's so light on my skin. It made my skin look and feel better. A+ in my book.
I have been using this product twice a day for weeks and it has not done anything to reduce the dark age spots I have. I would have to say it isn't worth the money I spent on it.
"it says 6-12weeks or something for results, but ive been applying 3 times a day for a week on my upper lip and i already see an improvement!!"
"Product nice and soft on my skin..seeing lightening of my dark spot on my face after only 5 days....Get it, I think you will like it too"
First time using an age spot remover and this one is perfect. Can't believe how well it works!
"I love it , love it. Not greasy and go on smooth..."
This product is the bomb dot come. It just made most if not all of my dark spots vanish in no time.
Skin feels soft and smooth.Non greasy and I could see improvement after just one application.
I'm seeing improvements to my face in a matter of two weeks!
"Haven't had long enough to know if it works, but I'm so glad it little to no scent unlike so many other similar products."
I was so excited to find the Kiss Red E creme. I had about given up on my freckles that have turned to dark splotches all over my hands and even on my face. I can already tell a big difference in the intensity of the brown spots by using this creme.
No artificial smell. Evens dark spots an de pigmentation.
"Awesome Dark Spot Corrector Creme. super plus because it is Organic and Vegan!!! saw a big difference in my dark spots, acne scars, and sun spots. really good product for the price. you must try if you haven't, totally recommend"
This is a great product. Goes on extremely smooth. Makes your skin look and feel great. Helps with the dark spots a lot. Highly recommend this product.
