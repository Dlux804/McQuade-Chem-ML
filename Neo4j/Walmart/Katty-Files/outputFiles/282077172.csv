I have used this for 2 years and I love it . It is not oily and it keeps my face soft and filling good all day. I use it once in the morning and before bed. I also use the hawian pineapple face wash. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great price
This moisturizer and I have been together for Years...love that it is not greasy but feels silky and smooth...just love it!
"I started buying this a couple of years ago, then could not find it in stores. So glad that I can continue to purchase it st Swanson."
"love the feel of the oil-free moisturerizer. Have used it for years, but was unable to find it locally"
I was always told I had dry skin-so I used more oily moisturizers and always broke out---now have used this for the last 3+ years and no problems. Really love this product....
"I recently started an HCG diet which recommends not using any oils on the body. I am 54 and was skeptical that an oil free moisturizer would be OK for my face, but this works great! This moisturizer has a light fresh fragrance, and leaves my skin soft and smooth, plus I trust Alba Botanica to use safe ingredients."
"I have used this product for about a week now and I really like it. I had been using L' Occitane Immortelle Precious but at $50 a jar it gets pretty pricey fast. It was also too heavy but I like Alba Botanica better, it is light on my skin. I mix it with oil free tinted moisturizer and gently apply it on my face before heading out the door and its perfect. It has not caused me to break out. I have combo-oily skin with few breakouts.I do wish it were a pump and not a jar but I would still recommend this to a friend."
"this is an affordable facial moisturizer that is lightweight. it is also natural which is huge for me. i dont want all sorts of chemicals on my face, i want to keep it as simple as possible! my face feels clogged easily, but this lets my face breathe, but gives it the moisture so it doesnt feel tight, dry... i love it :)"
"Leaves my face very oily after a couple of hours. I went against all the ""oily"" reviews in hopes it would be different! This is not a good product for my face, maybe it is for someone else but it definitely is not oil free."
"I love this moisturizer because it's OIL FREE and it absorbs quickly into my skin for a glowy complexion. The scent is very subtle and smells somewhat floral. However, after doing plenty of research, I heard it contains octyl palmitate, which causes blackheads. This bothered me a bit because I always thought the ingredients were all natural. So far, I had no problems with this product and no breakouts.So i will continue to buy this until i find my HG lotion."
"I love this cream! I wish they did not put vit e in it, but you can feel is moisturizing your skin all day, and its very quick and easy to apply. Also a great value!"
This product claims its oil free yet after i apply it to my clean dry face a few hours later my face looks all shiny and is super oily! All i like about it is the smell but i dont see it doing anything for my skin! Why claim your product is oil free yet its not?
I was looking for an oil-free facial moisturizer that is paraben free. I found this product at it is amazing. My skin looks and feels great.
