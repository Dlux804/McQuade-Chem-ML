"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and I'm so happy that I did. Now that I'm in the other side of 25, I've tried to find anti aging products that won't break the budget yet still work. This makes my skin so soft and smooth. 10/10 would recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've only been using it for a little over 2 weeks and my skin feels amazing. My face looks a bit more firm and lifted, but it doesn't feel tight or dry which is what I'm always afraid of with lift products. My skin feels so soft, and it feels softer instantly when you put it on! This is a product I will continue to use! I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this product every night for the last 2 weeks, I can really see my dark skin spots getting lighter. I love how the product's non oily formula makes my sensitive skin give off a radiant yet supple glow. I can wear this alone or under my night moisturizer without any counter reactions of the products, which has been perfect to add to my night time skinroutine. . I received this product complimentary from influenster in return to give my honest feedback. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this in addition to the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Derm Intensives Hyaluronic Acid for about 1 month and noticed some difference in my skin. My skin felt more supple and I noticed less fine lines around my eyes. I used twice a day- once in the morning and once before bed. I received both products complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was hesitant about this product at first, but not anymore! LOREAL - 10% Pure Vitamin C Serum really does work. It's your solution for dullness, uneven skin tone, and it even helps prevent wrinkles. I have sensitive skin and this product is gentle enough for daily use. However, it is a little pricey. I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product, complimentary, to sample and give my honest review on. I was hesitant on using it because my skin can be sensitive. I did not like how oily it was and it did not work well under my make-up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I find out I start having lines of wrinkles uder my eyes, get nervous about it. Then I got this vitamin c serum as a sample to test for, and it does work! I have been using it for a month already and I can tell my skin texture around my eyes has improvements. Although it says the impacts are starting to tell in the first week. But mine starts to tell in about 3 weeks. But for the price of this product. I would definitely recommend it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Once of my favorite parts about this serum was the warming sensation. It's a little odd at first (and they warn you on the label), but for some reason it made my skin feel great after application. I'm not sure my face looked lightyears better, but it felt fantastic. This is such a great serum for the price. I've tried a lot of expensive brands and this held it's own! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this product through Influenster to try it out, and boy am I glad I did. I recently started noticing a crease between my eyes getting deeper. Once I started to use this product, in conjunction with the Revitalift Hyaluronic Acid Serum I noticed a big difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm overall happy with this product I received complimentary from Influenster. This gave a nice warming sensation in the skin when applied and felt light and easy to apply. Love the price point and would reccomend for daily use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this for review and I love it but the packaging isn't my favorite. I wish it was in a squeeze tube or something. But it works well and I'd definitely buy it for myself after I finish this tube. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product in my Influenser Box and wow was I amazed with the results I saw in just one week of applying this due to my face & neck twice a day. I even experienced some semi dead skin peeling which I normally have to get a chemical peel to experience! Ingredients were very brightening, lightweight, and a little goes and long way!

I am obsessed with L'Oréal Paris Derm Intensives!!! Thanks to @influenster I received these babies for #free !!! Since I've been using them my skin feels amazing and looks radiant!!! I dont see a single wrinkle! I highly recommend #RevitaliftDermIntensives [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for about a month now and I am obsessed! It has done amazing things to my skin. As I have been noticing my skin aging, dullness, acne, lines starting to form, I have been looking for a product that boosts my skins beauty. This is it!! I have even been able to skip my foundation because of how even and bright my skin tone now is. A slight warmth when applied to my skin lets me know it is working. Buy this. You will love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free in exchange for my review. I love this product! It makes my skin feel smooth and healthy, but it doesn't leave behind any greasy residue! I can use it every day without any build up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved this serum for testing purposes and I am glad I did! I have used Vitamin C serums in the past that dried flaky on my skin. This serum is light but makes my skin feel smooth and nourished. I usually use highlighter during my normal makeup routine and have cut back after using this. It has made my skin brighter and healthy looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this from Influenster for review purposes* - I was so excited to receive this product because my skin scars very easily after I get a break out. I've been usually this pretty much daily since I received it and my scarring has been brightening up for sure. Some vitamin c products can irritate my skin or make it burn but this doesn't. The texture is interesting and I don't like it for the day time but it's great for the evening. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product made a noticeable difference in my skin just after 1 month of use. My skin has become brighter , and dark spots have faded. I highly recommend to those with acne marks because it really does brighten the skin. I did receive this complementary but did leave an honest review [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this for about a month now and I love it! A little bit goes a long way. I love the slightly warm feeling that it gives your face. My wrinkles are less noticeable which is amazing! I will continue to make this a part of my daily routine. I received this complentry from Influenster and it's by far one of the best things I've been asked to try :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this serum to try for free and absolutely love it. It leaves my skin feeling great from the moment I put it on at night until I wake up in the morning. It also goes in nicely in the morning and my makeup goes over it now problem. I have been using it 2 times a day for 2 weeks and feel like I have seen improvements in my whole face overall. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is by far one of the best products I have at this moment. I was using another vitamin C serum but it was too sticky and went everywhere. This product is lightweight and gets absorbed into my skin. I put it on after washing my face and before my make up and my skin hasn't been GLOWING for weeks now. A little goes a very long way!
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes
This product works wonderfully! It has a very velvet like smooth texture. I have been using it for about to weeks now and has brightened up my face and makes my complexion more even. I really enjoy this product. I have received it from influenster free for reviewing my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Loved loved my Loved loved loved my L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Derm Intensives Serums 10% Pure Vitamin C Serum! It didn't feel like it was adding oil on top of the 1.5% Serum and soaked right into my skin after my shower. I have combination skin so I was really worried about this. But this will keep the old age around my eyes/forehead + wrinkles at bay! Thank you for my free testers! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recently received this for review from influenster. The vitamin c serum feels warm when you put it on. I've noticed that my skin is smoother and brighter. I developed dark patches during pregnancy and they have started to fade with the use of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love this! It leaves my skin amazingly soft and smooth. My husband even said something the other day about how nice my skin looks! I received this for free for testing purposes and this is my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got to try this serum as a part of Influenster's campaign and boy was I surprised! This serum is easily blends into the skin and brings that radiance on your face. True to word, it's a good value for money. Easy to apply. If you are looking for some good serum within your budget this is the right one."
I was so excited to use my Revitalift 10% pure vitamin c!!! It feels so good rubbing it on my face. I noticed a difference in two or three days. My skin looked amazing and felt so soft and healthy. This cold weather had begun to make my face look tired and my skin so dull. I am now so excited that I look refreshed and wide awake. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Disclaimer: I received this free through Influenster.
I've noticed a reduction in fine forehead lines since using this product. The product has a slight warning effect at first (no redness) and I like the mattifying effect. I haven't experienced any negative effects from this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So it's been a week since I've used this product with the 1.5% hyaluronic acid serum and I must say that I love this product. I've seen a major difference in my acne prone skin. My skin looks radiant, brighter and healthy looking. I will repurchase. Thanks Influenster for sending me these products for free for testing purposes only [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had high good hope for this product when I got it complimentary from influenster in exchange for my honest opinion. Although I like the texture and the warm feeling on my face when you first applied it, I didn't really see any difference within a week as it say on their box. I would continue to use it and hopefully after a couple more week, I'll noticed bigger difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the texture of this product, it leaves a great matte finish that would be great as a primer under makeup. it doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, even though there is a high concentration of vitamin c. I haven't used it long enough to notice any brightening effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product and packaging. The metal tube and tip ensure the serum stays fresh and potent until you are ready to use. I noticed visible brighter and smoother skin after just the first use and felt my skin was healthier and more radiant after two weeks. This really made a difference as the heat began to come on in my building which is extremely drying. I reviewed L'Oreal's Vitamin Serum as part of Influenster's Complimentary review program. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've tried a lot of wrinkle products and spent a lot of money! I'm obsessed with this! I've only been using it a couple of weeks and am already seeing results! It's easy to use and doesn't cost a lot! My skin feels fabulous! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm so lucky to recieve Loreal 10% Pure Vitamin C Serum from Influenster. It is an amazing product that brightens the face, evens out skin tone and vanishes some fine lines. I Love it and i highly recommend this product. I'm a revitalift loreal user from the verystart and it continues to amaze me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this, I feel like it's my 'sun of the day' in a bottle. When I put it on initially, you get a warming/ tightening feeling. I've been using this serum for a few weeks now and have noticed my face tighter. I aim for twice a day but I am a mom ya'll and sometimes I get just once. I recommend doing it right after you shower, kind of like exfoliating before you apply it. As a 'SAHM' this is sometimes the only 'me' time of the day. I definitely recommend. #complimentary [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Been using this for a couple weeks and have really noticed a difference in the skin on my face! It's a lot more radiant and fresh looking, and my fine lines are a lot less noticeable! Would definitely recommend this product and will be repurchasing. I received this product for free through Influenster in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a complimentary sample through Influenster for my honest feedback. I think the product is great and really does rejuvenate your skin but it is a bit sticky and greasy. I will only apply this overnight as I don't want my face to feel or appear shiny during the day. It's a great overnight product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using L'Oreal Revitalift skin care products for a year, but I have never used a serum before, as I thought it was not necessary. After using this serum twice a day for a couple of weeks, it seems that my skin feels silky and looks softer. It slides, absorbs quickly and has no fragrance. All very satisfied. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love it. It's warming in a good way! Makeup glides on with a beautiful finish—no primer, no setting spray. It's awesome! My texture improved in less than 3 days. (I happened to receive this complimentary for testing purposes!) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This vitamin c serum works so good for my skin. It keeps my skin soft and smooth. It says to use morning and night but I only use at night and I can see a difference. The texture is a bit different than what I'm use to and it absorbs so fast into the skin. I received this complementary for testing purposes, all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It was interesting to see it warmed up my skin when applied, perhaps just validating the fact it is working?? I haven't used it long enough to see drastic improvements in skin texture or blemishes but so far it does on smoothly and seems to keep my skin looking fresh! I received this from Influenster to test out :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this vitamin c concentrate serum. It has a soft silky texture and left my skin feeling amazing! I don't trust use many drugstore serums, but this one should be considered high end. My skin has never been brighter and smoother. Love this!"

"I received this complimentary from Influenster.

"you have to wear this for a few weeks, youll see a difference. i love loreals stuff, its cheaper than most and good quality. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this for a month now and I really see a difference in my skin. The dark spots have just about disappeared and the texture of my skin has really softened. I'm 50 and my skin is dry. The serum wears well under makeup too. I'm really happy with the results.
"I love the way this product feels going on. It makes my skin feel instantly smooth, and after using it every day for a few weeks, my skin looks brighter and more even toned. This is going to be a permanent part of my skincare regimen! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I BOUGHT THIS ON MONDAY AND I LOVE IT. I ALSO USE IT WITH REVLIFT CREAM AND I USE MY LOREAL EYE CREAM TOO. JUST LOVE YOUR PRODUCTS
Saw this in a magazine and was intrigued. I have been using it now for three weeks.i can see a decrease of pigments under my eyes and on my cheeks. Also fine lines are decreasing. Will definitely be making this part of my every day routine.
I did notice my skin is started to look a little brighter after using consistently. But if you skip just one day it starts to revert. I do like that is light and not thick or sticky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I never used vitamin c serum before . I was using other loreal products. I saw this on the shelf while browsing other products so that I should give a try. I used only for few days and start feeling difference in few days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this product complementary from Influenster for testing purposes, it felt nice on the skin but didn't notice any change in my skins appearance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product isn't bad, but it's not nearly as effective as my current serum, and I didn't see vastly improved results. Might be better for someone with another skin type, but not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this as part of a campaign to review this item. I have used other vitamin C serums and really did prefer this over the others - I liked the creamier formula and the way it absorbed into my skin. Wasn't sticky or wet feeling like others I've used. The packaging is very nice and seems to help maintain the integrity and quality of the serum. The slight warming sensation was a plus too. Overall I recommend this if you're in the market for a vitamin C serum! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed this product that I received in my Voxbox. I used it in my dry, sensitive areas at night after my shower followed by the oil serum and left my skin feeling well nourished and clean in the morning. I will definitely purchase to keep my skin feeling silky smooth! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was sent to me for testing purposes and I enjoyed the product. I found it effective and I think a good amount of product comes in the bottle. I don't particularly enjoy the way my skin feels post product, but it fades pretty quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free and was hesitant to switch from my regular skin care routine to try it out but I'm very glad I gave it a shot! My skin felt so smooth, but also much more firm and plump after use! Had no issues with irritation or dry patches (which I really struggle with in the winter). Definitely would recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was like magic on my face, after using this serum it has never felt more smooth. Very gentle on my skin which is often sensitive.. a little bit of product goes a long way so even though the bottle isn't very big, it should last a long time. I noticed immediately the texture of my skin was all even too. Thanks to Influenster for giving me a complementary testing product. Will definitely purchase in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as part of an Influenster campaign and I absolutely love it. It seems like it should leave my skin greasy but instead, it leaves it soft, smooth, and it can be worn day or night. This has become a staple in my skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this complementary from Influenster for my honest review. I liked this serum, and had never considered using a pure vitamin c serum before receiving this. I did notice a slight warming, tightening sensation after use, but it did not leave my skin feeling oily or anything like that. I liked the look of my skin after use, and I feel comfrotable adding this to my daily routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this complementary from Influenster for my honest review.
"Honestly turning 30 made me realize how much I needed to start focusing more on my skin. This product did not disappoint, I have seen such improvement in my tone and my face just feel so nice after applying it. Already have my friends using it. Would definitely purchase again :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this item complimentary for testing purposes and loved it! Made my skin feel super smooth and soft after application, and loved the easy, clean packaging. The only set back for me was my skin feeling just a tad dried out after a few hours. Otherwise a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product from Influenster but these opinions are all my own! I am in love with this product! The feel and application of this product is truly amazing! My results are reduced fine lines and the improvement to my skin texture, tone and hydration is off the charts! I will never be without this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was sent to me from vox box. I have super sensitive skin so I have to be careful what I put on my face. The product itself doesn't have much smell, but the feel is so amazing. It felt like velvet going on. The warm feeling was a bit odd for me but some may love it. It definitely left my face feeling moisturized and smooth! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this free for testing purposes from #influenster. I have sun and age spots on my cheeks so I was excited to try this. Unfortunately, I didn't notice any real difference in my skin and the spots were still just as noticeable. This may work on brightening up younger skin, but not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary to test. I was confused on how to use it, what it was for, and what step in my routine it should be. I also did not like the texture and how it felt on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I personally didn't like this product because I don't really have a problem w/ uneven skin tone which is the predominant problem this will help you with. So, personally it's just an overly expensive, extra step. I got this complimentary from influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried using this for a few weeks and it seems to have performed below what my less expensive vitamin c cream did. I didn't notice any difference in my skin's texture. And the cheaper cream would speed up the healing of hormonal acne, because my skin sometimes forgets it's aging."
I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this via Influenster to try, I was skeptical at first...BUT now I love it! I have noticed changes in my skin tone enough to where I feel super comfortable going out without makeup! I also like the warming sensation you get while applying! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for 3 weeks, and I can honestly say my skin looks brighter. I'm a dark skinned woman so I'm always concerned of lightening when it's supposed to brighten. With this product, my skin looks less dull and vibrant. I would purchase it. I received this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product absorbs into my skin so delicately and naturally. It's not oily or greasy and doesn't leave a weird residue or interfere with putting on your daily makeup. Ive noticed a more even skin tone since starting use a few weeks ago and I am enjoying the results. Thanks to Influenster who provided this complimentary product to me so I could share my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product as a complimentary product for review from Influenster. I have been using it for about three weeks, and I must say the difference is quite noticeable. The fine lines on my forehead and near my nose are definitely less noticeable. My skin is so smooth and soft. I am definitely impressed with these results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free from my influnser box. I was I very excited because I've heard many good things about vitamin c serum. I waited a week because reviewing this product. I love this so much. I use it morning and night and it has become my favorite part of my routine. Not only is my skin extra soft, it was cleared up my acne as well. I'm going to use this product forever [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free to test and review. When I applied this serum, after a few days I could tell it had a slight brightening effect. My skin didn't feel especially moisturized after using, and it wasn't pore-minimizing or dark spot minimizing, either. I will use this sample up, but I would not purchase because L'Oreal is not cruelty free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love that it soaks into the skin and dries instantly! It makes creams or moisturizers easier for the skin to absorb. I saw results in about 3 weeks and I keep seeing improvement in the look and feel of my skin. What I love about it the most is the PRICE!
"works like as dream in my skin, hydrates and changes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this recently to try out, and I love it! It helped a lot with my fine lines that are under my eyes and it makes my skin have a nice glow!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using it for over a month and my skin started drastically improving withing two weeks! I've never had such good and fast results with any of my high end products. This is by far a revolutionary product. The serum is so smooth on my skin. My skin has more radiance and looks more supple! I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieced this product complimentary for reviewing purposes, and I really like it. It's slightly warming to the touch (which I like), doesn't have a strong scent, and really improved the look of my deep set forehead wrinkles. The only thing I did not like is how it pills [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was sent this product for sampling by Influenster. As a stressed out graduate student, I was super excited to try out this product. I saw improvement in my skin. I will continue to use this product as many dermatologist recommend using a vitamin c [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product as an influencer and I was very excited to try it. I have dry skin so I was hoping it would help with that. Unfortunately it didn't soak into my skin that well and left a bit of film. To their defense, I did not use it 2 times a day every single day as directed. I would forget from time to time and/or not have time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as part of Influensters campaign. I feel that the potential for the product is there, it just doesn't really deliver what it says it will. A solid week of using it religiously didn't really affect my complexion at all. Also it doesn't glide on as smoothly as it could but does leave the skin feeling soft. I feel at the price point its a nice little addition to your skincare routine, maybe using it under the primer before make up it's a good use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product definitely performed better than I expected. I could tell my skin was brighter and smoother during the time I used it. Glad I found something Comparable in quality and a great price. This product was sent to me complimentary for review. All opinions are my own.
I received this to try out along with the HA serum and these products are a game changer. I use high end products like la mer to drug store products and am so impressed with these products. It didn't take long to notice wrinkles reduced and my skin was glowing even after the first use. This will be part of my beauty routine from now on and I recommend it to everyone. The price point is great too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After applying this for a few days I've noticed a change... at first I was hesitant to try this brand since I've never tried it before... but Im glad I did. Thank you L'Oréal and Influenster for sending this over [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am so glad I tried this product. I'm a little concerned about some age related lines in starting to get on my face and this product has helped so much! A little goes a long way and I can already tell such a difference after only 3 weeks of use! Truly a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product does its job well. It has brought good elasticity to my skin and makes my skin look healthier. The packaging is easy to use. I wish the frangrance was different but otherwise a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this from Influenster for free for my honest review. I used this product for over a month and I noticed it had faded my acne scars some but that's about it. I didn't notice a difference on fine lines but I may have to use it for a longer period of time to notice anything. I would purchase this again to see if long time use would produce better results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have enjoyed using this product over the past month. My skin looks brighter and healthier. I have not yet noticed an improvement in wrinkles, but I am hopeful that I will see more results with continued use. I received this product to test for Influenster.

"After using this product just a few times, I felt like my skin had gotten a much needed drink! It was so crazy how much a difference it made! The only con I have for the product was the way it felt after it dried. But it may have been locking in that moisture, so I'm not mad at it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this for free from Influenster for testing. I waited a few weeks before reviewing so I can give my best opinion of the product. It goes on smoothly; my skin looks more radiant. It hasn't had a huge affect on wrinkles yet. I feel like it helps moisturize my skin as well. What I don't like is that it has an unpleasant odor when first applied. Overall, I like this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this free from Influenster & I'm honestly surprised at how it has changed my skin. Very minimal for now, since it's been less than a few weeks, but in that time alone, it's managed to help my skin feel slightly softer & my acne scars seem to have faded quite a bit. I can't say much about wrinkles since I'm in my mid-20s, so there's not much to fix yet, but it does smooth out the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way this goes on easily and smoothy. It did make my face red for about 15-20 minutes after applying it, but eventually went away. (That's why only rating 4 stars). The box said it had been tested on all types of skin, so I wasn't expecting my face to turn red. I normally don't have any reaction to any skin products so I was surprised this happened. But other than that the product is great and you can immediately feel a difference once you apply it!"
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster to review about a month ago. The first week of use, I noticed some brightness in my skin no major changes . I do feel like you can put to much product on your hand for some reason it creates this build up of product (keep that in mind when applying the serum) Overall, it does a great job of leaving my skin feeling super soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has quickly become one of my holy grails! I recently moved from Los Angeles to Kentucky and was freaking out because my skin isn't used to winter weather! It was dull, dry and just overall not cute! I received this product complemtary and was excited to try it.. but honestly not expecting to come to the rescues. GIRL was I wrong. My dry areas quickly vanished. I've also noticed that my face looks more youthful, plump and glowing. YAASSSS"
This was sent to me from influencer I've been using it for about two weeks and I see a big difference in my skin it seems like my fine lines are less defined! Will keep it up to see more improvement [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this for a couple weeks and I like it with the serum! It has a warming sensation which the box said was normal. I don't notice a big difference yet but I like the feeling of it on my skin. I liked that it was sealed until I broke it open upon first use. I received this via Influenster for free to sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product has been great for reducing my dark spots! After using it for about a month I definitely saw improvements. I have experienced irritation with vitamin c products in the past, but this did not irritate my skin or cause me to break out at all. I was lucky enough to receive this product complementary for testing purposes and loved it! Definitely will be repurchasing this in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed using this product, which I received free for testing purposes. It felt really luxurious, and my skin always felt soft and radiant after using it. It was fun, but I probably wouldn't make it part of my regular skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do enjoy this product I receive complimentary from Influenster, although I have not used it regularly enough to notice big changes in my skin. It makes me skin soft, it has a pleasant smell. I noticed more vibrancy in my skin after the first time using but my skin was shocked so overtime I didn't notice as drastic a result."
I was pleasantly surprised by this product! It brightened my skin while also evening out my complexion. I love it and will purchase in the future!! *I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this product complimentary from Influenster to review about a month ago. I have used L'Oreal before so I anticipated great results form the start.

Overall, it does a great job of leaving my skin feeling amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this product from Influenster in their Vox Box for the L'Oréal Campaign and I absolutely loved it ! I have been using it since I got it and after a few weeks it has truly made a difference on my skin. My skin feels hydrated, looks radiant and I feel as though the texture on my skin has decreased.

Vitamin C is one of my all-time favorite skin care ingredients. This serum really help even out my skin tone and it felt really nice when I was applying it. It absorbed very well. I like that of high concentration of vitamin C. You're really getting a good bang for your buck. with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this product to text and I'm so glad I did. I suffer from dry skin in the fall/winter months. I've tried numerous different moisturizers, both drug store and high end brands. This worked as well as some of the high end brands, but for half the price tag and actually showed results much quicker. After 1 week of use, I could tell a major difference. I will definitely be purchasing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this in combination with the Hyaluronic Acid serum and so far I have been loving it. This makes my skin feel soft, doesn't dry out my skin and every morning I wake up with a more refreshed look. I've been wanting to get more into face products and this is definitely something I'd use again!"
I received this complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster and was a little hesitant to try it at first because I have very sensitive skin. After using this product for a little while, I think that it makes my skin feel nice. I think i will give it more time to discover how it affects my lines on my face because I haven't used it for that long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. During application there is a slightly warning sensation. It's pleasant an relaxing. Using this product just twice a day showed noticeable improvements in less than 2 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this product's texture. It absorbed well. Other vitamin C products can be very irritating, but this product did not irritate my skin at all. It also worked well with other products and did not pull up when other products were placed in top. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster and was a little hesitant to try it at first because I have very sensitive skin. However, the tingly sensation wasn't so bad and I did like the way it left my skin feeling.

"I received this product free from Influencer, however I really enjoyed this serum. My husband could see a difference in the smoothness of my skin. The only thing I didn't like is I felt that I had do use a lot of product to cover my face every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Received Loreals Revitalift Derm Intensives 10% Pure Vitamin C Concentrate from Influenster for testing purposes. I love that it is lightweight on the face. A little goes a long way with this product. I like to focus more on my undereyes and this product gives me a brightening effect. I use less brightening concealers now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is best to use at night. It has a rich feel, but the texture is creates on the skin is troublesome. It well lease a flaking/peeling like texture so do not wear makeup after applying it. I was sent this from Influenster complimentary to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The longer I use this product, the more I like it. I have very dry skin that is easily irritated so I usually avoid strong products. However, I have come to learn that this product is gentle, non-irritating, and does not worsen my dry skin as I originally feared. Upon application you will feel a slight warming sensation which quickly subsides. Over time I have noticed that my skin seems brighter and more even toned!"

I opened up my Influenster's Vox Box and voila! This was inside! I tried it today I so far it does feel like it has made my pores smaller and less visible.

I had the pleasure of trying the C Serum out for exchange of my honest opinion. This product has been great. My skin is loving the moisture and a little goes a long way. I would always use this following the hyaluronic acid. They work great together. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did not like how oily this product is and it didnt really feel great because i have sensitive skin and the burning sensation was not that great. I had to stop because of this reasoning.

"Vitamin C is an important step in my morning skincare routine. I was happy to receive this product for free to try because I had just run out of my serum. The good thing about this is that it's 10% Vitamin C and the packaging is great to prevent oxidation. This didn't sting or give my skin a burning sensation, it was quite gentle. However, other than just slight brightnening effects, I haven't noticed anything extraordinary. I also don't love the texture, it feels too silicone-y to me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. Perhaps vitamin c isnt the right solution for my skin in improving radiance, but I found this product to not leave behind blackheads in many pores. I have oily skin so I'm selective about my serum step in my skincare routine but I think this would be a good product for 20 somethings who want to start youth retention and whose skin can tolerate it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the feel of this! It's so silky and absorbs quickly with a slight warming affect. My only complaint would be that I had to use a little more that suggested so it will not last as long as I was hoping for. But it makes your skin feel very smooth and supple.
*I received this complimentary for testing purposes.* [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When you put this on it is very smooth and just absorbs into your skin. It doesn't leave your skin dry. No greasiness at all. The tube is pretty small but a little goes a long way with this product. It does smooth the appearance of your skin. I did receive this from Influenster for testing purposes but opinion is my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this complimentary to try out, I was a little skeptical at first because of sensitive skin but it left my face feeling fresh and bright after consistent use, even with the crazy weather changes outside. Only complaint is I wish it were in a bigger tube or could stand on it's own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this product to test out from Influenster. I love how it makes my skin glow and makes it soft. The only drawback was that it seemed to wear off kind of quick and then leave my skin feeling a bit dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this product free to try and was very excited because it's a drugstore item. I'm surprised by the rave reviews as I did not see any difference using this product. It kept my skin hydrated, but so did my other products. Unfortunately, I will not repurchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recieved this product complementary from Influenster for testing purposes. I love the results product ha given me and plan to purchase more from this line. The hyaluronic acid is AMAZING! Wish this package was spmething that would stand up in medicine cabinet, but aside from that I have no complaints! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way this feels on my skin! I've been using it for several weeks (along with the hyaluronic acid serum) and could definitely see a difference in brightness after just a few days. Will definitely purchase again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product not long ago, and I must say that it has helped change the overall look of my skin. The fine lines are dissapearing, and I haven't suffered for any breakouts or reactions to this product. That's a big plus with my -extra- sensitive type of skin. The only downside is the use of dimethicone and glycerin, I tried to avoid them in general but I'll take this line as my exception to my rule. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this complimentary for my honest review! So here it is.
"I don't love this product. While I did see some improvement to my skin, I don't care for the smell the product leaves behind. Also I found I had to wash it off my hands immediately as it was slippery to the touch. The Hyaluronic Acid Serum is where it's at! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The bottle itself was so cool and then the ease of the product was even a more pleasant experience. With just the slightest bit on my fingertip I was able to apply over my whole face. My skin absorbed it quickly and I felt great going without makeup after I applied the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product for free to sample with the Influenster program. For me and my skin type it was greasy feeling and felt greasy on the skin. I have a preference to serums since they absorb faster. Maybe in a different format like a serum I would definitely try [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was recently given the opportunity to try this in exchange for review and I was very happy with results! I definitely noticed a restored glow to my complexion with daily use. The warming feeling really made me feel like it was doing it's job! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary for testing and an honest review. I enjoyed this serum but to me the best part was the soft, smooth feel of my skin after applied. It literally felt like silk. I did notice that it helped even my skin tone out and gave me a brighter look. The only problem I had with it was that it would flake off when I would apply my markup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It became my must-have product. It is easily absorbed, my skin feels nourished after using it. I noticed that my skin looks younger, more even and radiant. I found the packaging rather innovative: it helps to preserve vitamin C efficiency. It works perfectly as a makeup primer - all the next layers are applied smoothly. I will definitely buy it again. I received this as a complimentary gift from Influenster and L'Oréal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product seems okay. I already use a high concentration vitamin c serum for acne scars so I used this in combo with that. I think this will be great for travel (other vitamin c serums are usually a liquid verse this being a cream). I did receive this as a sample for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for testing purposes. I really enjoyed the other serum that came with this, but I didn't enjoy this one as much. The biggest turn off for me was the smell it left on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved this as a complimentary gift from Influenster and L'Oréal. I started using this serum when I got it and I thought it was nice; gave my skin some moisture under my moisturizer. However after using it every day for 2 weeks I didn't feel like I saw much of a difference in my skin. I also didn't like that it left a sticky residue feel on my hands; I had to wash my hands after each use. Overall I don't think I'd purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this complimentary from Influenster to try out. After weeks of use, it has made a dramatic difference in my skin. I feel so much more comfortable without makeup and have received many compliments on my skin when I don't wear makeup. It has reduced the appearance of my fine lines and small wrinkles, and really gave my face a beautiful youthful glow. I highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster.com and being that this is my first time using a vitamin c serum I must say that I love it. This Vitmain C Serum brightens and evens out my complexion. A must have. It does tingle a bit when you put it on and when rubbing it in, it does warm up which I love that feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like it vitamin c serum, it made my skin feel more radiant and even skin tone. I love this for the price point as well. Feels like a luxury brand. I received this product complimentary from Influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free, and for testing purposes, and was very surprised by its effectiveness! I saw it even my tone right away, and is very light on the skin. I don't know about wrinkle reduction just yet, but I love how it brightens my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the warm senestion i get when i apply this. I really havent used it long enough to notice any change in my skin, but if vitamin C is as good for your skin as research says then it should work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the lightweight yet potent consistency. I have dry combination skin and it felt very cooling and hydrating on my skin. Definitely did not dry me out. Overall it left a very good and fresh feel on my skin. I did receive the item complimentary for testing purposes. I have already repurchased it :)
"I received this product complementary and was very pleased. I have used Vitamin C cream in the past so was expecting some stinging, but found this to be more tolerable than products in the past, which was a huge plus. Additionally, I was really happy with the texture-- it was less grainy than these products can be. Along with these 'pluses' it worked as a Vitamin C cream should and made my face radiant! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Vitamin C should be a staple in skincare routines, and this serum is the perfect fit. It has a nice texture, and I like the warming sensation upon contact with the skin. My skin has also looked better since I started using this. I definitely want to keep this product in my regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this from Influenster to try it out and I am totally hooked! I could not be more obsessed with vitamin C everything right now, and this fits perfectly into my routine. It's winter in upstate NY and I am feeling dry and dull. This serum helps to lighten and brighten without sacrificing any precious moisture. I've been pairing with the Hyaluranic acid serum they sent me for a 1-2 punch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed this product. It felt great in my skin and I noticed improvement to my skin tone. The price point makes this a go to product!

"This feel like pure LUXURY. After applying the hydrating hyaluronic acid serum, this perfectly locks in the moisture and makes your skin feel like a baby!!

"At first I was excited and nervous to try the product but I'm glad I did. The packaging for the product was striking, simple and beautiful. The product really sticks out.

I think that the product is a great value and it does what it states it will do. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this product complimentary for testing purpose by Influenster! I received this a month ago and knew exactly where I wanted to try it first! I have a lot of hyperpigmentations
around my chest area and my cheeks. After about a week I saw lighten around those areas! I have tried many Vit C serum and this one did not burn for me which is a plus and it's at an affordable price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product to test and I think I am really starting to like it! I loved the texture and how it made my skin feel so soft! I don't think it's my favorite L'Oréal product but I have started incorporating it into my daily routine.
**all opinions are my own** [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using this after being sent this by Influenster for the purpose of review. My first impression of this was that it was thicker than most products that I've used, but that was completely fine, because it meant I had to use less product. It made my skin feel smooth and velvety and with use, it improved the texture of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product free for testing purposes from Influenster VoxBox. I loved it. I don't know how I have not discovered it before. I tend to have sensitive skin with some anti-aging products but this worked great. I would definitely purchase in the future.
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. Overall I really enjoyed using this serum. It make my skin look so much brighter and smoother, and over time helped to lighten dark spots from acne scarring. However, too much of this product on the skin causes it to crumble, so use sparingly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this complimentary for testing and review purposes and all opinions are my own. I love this product, I have recommended and purchased on my own. Perfect formula, it has lightened my dark spots as well as smoothed and softened my skin to where my fine lines have started to disappear after using twice a day for ge past month!"
I love this Vitamin C Serum! It's light and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I've only been using it for a couple of weeks so I don't see much of a difference with my acne scaring yet BUT I do feel that my skin has gotten brighter over all. I did receive this product for free from Influenster but all opions expresses are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"By no means is this life changing, it's just ok. For the price a little more than ok is needed. I was sent the product for review purposes and although it was nice, it's not going to replace my vitamin c staple items. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free from Influenster to try out. I've had bad luck with Vitamin c serums in the past but this one went on smooth and matte, wore well under makeup and made my skin noticeably brighter and smoother. It's a staple in my daily routine now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have been using the 10% Pure Vitamin C Serium for approximately a month. It goes on smooth but I do seem to have to use about a dimes worth of product. I don't believe I have used the product long enough to see any drastic changes. For the price point I would possibly reconsider purchasing, but not sold on the brightening results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I swear by vitaminC serum this makes my skin tone so even and soft to touch so many people keep telling me that I'm glowing after I startued using it. It's a must for me now specially after having some spots from acne lightened up. I will keep using. I'm glad I received it complimentary to test.
"I used it every day for about 3 weeks and my skin got visibly better. I noticed it was smoother, brighter, and more radiant. It was also very well hydrated. I don't have a lot of wrinkles besides near my eyes and this product is not made for undereye so I cannot really speak on the lifting part but I really loved it and I am planning on using it more!

"I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes. I was super hesitant about adding something completely new like this as my skin can sometimes be a bit sensitive, but it was almost weightless and didn't cause me any negative skin issues. I felt like my skin looked tighter and firmer after the first two weeks and I will definitely continue to use it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is amazing! To be honest I did not really expect much from this. I've been using it about a week and for the first time in the winter I haven't been dealing with a dry face! This is lightweight and does not feel greasy at all. It absorbs quickly and is easy to throw into any routine. I even got compliments on my skin from a photographer and have been able to skip foundation lately. Highly recommend this. I received this product complimentary from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a good vitamin C item for the price. I wasn't wowed but it does similar things to other products I've tried like it. It definitely brightens as it does take off the dead layer of skin on the very surface of the face, leaving smoothness behind. My one qualm is the packaging—it was at times difficult to get the product out. I received this as a trial through Influenster and I would say it's worth the buy if you want a filet priced Vitamin C item. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for almost two months and I have not noticed more radiant skin or reduced wrinkles as this product claims. The price point to me was a bit high for a drug store brand as well. I like how the product dries quickly and feels lightweight, but I'm sure there are better and more affordable options. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product from influenster in exchange for review. I was initially skeptical as most of my skincare is higher end. I was pleasantly surprised at how much nicely it fit into my routine. I have been using this product about 3 weeks. I started using it twice daily but found that with my skin being sensitive once a day worked better. If you are looking for a quality drugstore serum look no further. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the vitamin C serum for about a month and love how my skin has changed. I've actually had a few friends comment on how nice my skin looks. It's so smooth when I apply it and my skin feels so happy. I do believe the depth of my wrinkles has been reduced. Over all, I love the new texture of my skin."

I received this as a free promotion to try out. I wasn't really sure what it was supposed to do until I read about it online. I started using it 2 weeks ago and right away it feels like it's doing...something. The instructions said that it might feel like a warming sensation on my skin and it certainly does. It's like I'm under a UV light for a few seconds. I'm not seeing a ton of difference yet but I'll give it some more time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I recieved this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I personally love luxury brand skincare, but this is a close contender for me.

"I have been researching a new vitamin C product to use during my pregnancy. I was very excited as it does not have a strong scent and the texture is light. I decided to write this review after 20 days of daily use. I did see some increase in texture but I was expecting more and better results. I will keep using it and pay attention to the difference, especially after the baby is born. I got this product complimentary for testing purposes.

"I received this product complimentary for reviewing and testing purposes. I do enjoy the serum itself - it gives a nice warming feeling upon application and really gives a brightness to the skin, however I dislike the packaging. I felt like even getting the smallest drop out of it, I would get 3x the amount just oozing out after the fact, which in turn is wasted product that gets stuck in the cap.

Received from Influenster and was very skeptical since I normally do not buy skincare lines from drugstore brands. So pleasantly surprised! Leaves my skin looking and feeling amazing.

I got this serum complementary from Influenster and I'm so happy I did! I probably would have never bought this in my own but I'm really enjoying it! The texture is almost a mix of a cream and silicone primer but in sinks into the skin really nicely.

I think the packaging could stand to be a bit less messy. It made my skin feel nice when I put it on, but I'm not sure how long it lasts. I put it on before bed. Winter is a nightmare on my skin anyway, so at least this is helping! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this product complimentary from Influenster. I used this morning and night for two weeks and I really enjoy this product. My skin feels extremely moisturized after using this, though I did not notice a huge difference in fine lines. The only downside is that this can feel a bit sticky, so I did feel like I had to give it a buffer before I felt like I could put on makeup or put my face on my pillow if going to bed.

Very smooth and feels great on my skin. I have had some acne issues and I'm not sure if it's due to this product or something else. But it left my skin silky and applying makeup after went smoothly.

"Thanks to Influenster and L'Oréal for providing me with this product to review! The overall texture was good and it did not have a strong smell, which I like.

Every woman should be using a vitamin c and this is the perfect product! The price is amazing as well! The texture of the product is great and doesn't leave a heavy texture on the skin.

"They seem to be trying to up their game at the drugstore, however when it comes to skincare I like the active ingredients to be one of the first listed and lesser filler ingredients.

I'd definitely suggest this to any needing an affordable Vitamin C serum - especially for the amount of product in the tube. You actually don't have to use much to cover your entire face. **I received this complimentary through influenster for testing purposes** [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Recieved this product for free to sample from Influenster. The product feels nice when applying it and maybe after long term use it would have an effect but I didn't see a difference in the time that I used it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved this product to try in exchange for my honest opinion and HONESTLY its a great product especially in combination with others from the line.

Not sure if thats supposed to happen but it does for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this to sample for free. I liked it. It was a little cloggy in my pores. The texture is pretty thick, so it works best if you only use a tiny amount. I didn't notice a huge amount of wrinkle reduction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product about a month ago through influenster. I've used it every morning and most evenings. While I haven't seen major improvements in fine lines, I do absolutely love how quickly it absorbs into my skin and how flawlessly my make up can be applied over it. My skin does feel more hydrated afterward. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This Vitamin C serum is one of the best on the market. It's a thick and creamy texture that gives off a slight warming sensation upon skin contact.

Also, the packaging and cap in this product can make it messy. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes."

I received this free in exchange for my review. I love vitamin c serums but this missed the mark for me.

I received this product free for testing and was very impressed by how it made my skin feel. I noticed a difference in my skin after just one week. The only thing I don't love is the packaging.

"I like this serum, and have noticed a change in the radiance of my face. It is a little heavy for my skin (combo) so I prefer to use it as part of my nighttime routine.

"I've been using this product for several weeks now along with another L'oreal Product and the results have been noticeable. My skin seems brighter and less dry. My skin seems younger and tighter.

"The Vitamin C Concentrate is formulated to increase the skin's radiance and neutralize free radicals and I have been using it for about 3 weeks now, twice a day. It has made my skin slightly more radiant and smoother with no irritaion. I'm glad to see that these new products have no parabens, mineral oil or synthetic dye or fragrance. However, I gave the Vitamin C Concentrate a 3 star rating because it contains dimethicone which is a silicone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this product complimentary from Influenster but this review is 100% honest. I love this cream. It glides on super smooth. And within a week maybe 2 I have noticed my skin looking extra bright and smooth. It sinks in quickly and doesn't feel greasy or sticky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have combination and sensitive skin, after trying the scrum, it isn't especially hydrating than what I have tried, and honestly, I didn't noticed any difference in my skin. But I appreciated it doesn't have any scent because I'm sensitive with the scent in my skincare products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is super smooth to apply which I really like. There honestly is no smell to it either! My face feels very smooth and soft with it on. I tend to have very dry skin but this left me feeling ready to apply my foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to get this product in the mail. When I put it on, it made my skin silky smooth. I've only been using it for a week and I can tell a difference in my skin and it has helped my acne!! I would buy this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. It helps with my lines around my eyes as well as my forehead lines. I use this morning an night for the passed 3 weeks and have noticed some change in my skin. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this complimentary for review. So far I enjoy the product, however I am terrible about being consistent with my skin routine. When I do use it, it feels great on- non greasy and silky smooth, and i don't have the warning sensation it mentions could happen. I haven't seen a big difference in fine lines but again I'm not super consistent in using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I was given this product free of charge to test and review it... and boy, am I glad that I was! A little bit of the serum goes such a long way, and the warming sensation lets me know that the product is ""working its magic"". I have been using the product regularly for several weeks now, and I have noticed that my normally dry skin is soft and supple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a complimentary tube for review purposes. I'm about a week post partum and honestly haven't been great about my skin care lately. I haven't necessarily seen a difference in fine lines (probably a combo of not being consistent and simply not paying attention) but my skin feels great! It goes on silky smooth and my skin feels great. I would definitely say it's worth a try [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this product for the last 2 weeks morning and evening and it has a nice consistency, not too sticky or greasy and leaves a matte finish. It's also very light and allows me to build with moisturizers. I have also noticed a difference in my skin, it's much brighter and even skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complementary from Influenster and am sooo happy I did. I don't ever use anything on my face because my skins a little sensitive so when I got it in the mail I was a little hesitant. It left my skin feeling nice a soft (and hydrated) without causing a reaction. I'm really inconsistent with my usage and have already seen a difference. I can only imagine how much of a difference I'd see if I was consistent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was sent this product for review by Influenster. I have used different Vitamin C products over the years but I really did enjoy this one. My skin seems brighter and I liked the way it felt on my skin. A little does go a long way! I have sensitive skin and I didn't have any weird reactions to the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was given this complimentary by Influenster. It's pharmaceutical grade vitamin C. I would recommend because a high grade vitamin C is typically very pricey. It is a nice consistency and left my skin very soft. It's difficult to tell the effects with only a month of use, but I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I must say, I am surprised at the quality you can receive from a drug store product. After only a few weeks, my skin is supple and brighter. I am excited to see what it looks like in a few months [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is so much better than I was expecting. It soaks in to skin really nicely, not leaving the tacky residue you normally have to deal with in products like these. I've also had some scars and dark spots fade since I started using this. My face has never looked better. I received this product for free in exchange for my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free from Influenster. I could tell a gigantic difference after the firstweek of using it! My skin tone was much more clear and even. It made mt skin feel so nice. I also like that it has no harsh scent. My only complaint is that it's sort of thick and doesn't spread very far. Otherwise, it's a great product and worth the price!"
I received this complimentary from Influenster for my honest review. It's a nice smooth consistency and I do feel like it helped brighten my complexion. It didn't irritate my sensitivite skin either which was a plus! I recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I tried it for several weeks now and it is okay. I haven't really noticed any physical differences in my face except it does make it a bit softer. The formula is thick but I did still have to use quite a bit to cover my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a complimentary from Influenster and I have to say I used it for a about 3 weeks before I wanted to make a review just to see how long I would see or notice any different and I have noticed it stated working in about a week I noticed a glow and Softness in my skin after just about a week. It made my skin so flawless and I'm glad I received it. I would totally and most definitely recommend this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great way to try a vitamin C serum and it rivals more expensive brands. I enjoyed using this, it has a good consistency. I really like the air tight packaging, you have to break through a seal on the tube. Serum helps skin renewal and reduces fine lines. I received this product for free for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this product for about two weeks and noticed my skin looked and felt less dull than before, even when I wasn't as hydrated! I've used this together with the hyaluronic acid and they have made my skin feel soft and refreshed. This product alone is very smooth and has a primer-like finish, and I don't get the warming feeling when applying. Nice packaging. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed this product. I was ising it nightly and LOVE the texture. I did not care for the packaging as metal tubes tend to get mishapen and sometimes too much product comes out. It made my face feel super soft and moisturized. I recieved this product for free but would absolutely buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I found that this product made my skin have a matte finish after using which was great for applying foundation product to afterwards. I haven't noticed much of an overall change to my skin but will continue to use to see if there are any gradual changes. I received this product complimentary to try however my opinion is based off the product itself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product and have been using it for the past 3 weeks. It feels great when applied to my skin. I may notice a slight difference in my skin appearance but nothing major yet. My skin tone seems a bit brighter. I will continue to use this product for a few more weeks. I received this product as a free promotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this product, along with the serum for about two weeks now. I find it to be lightweight and moisturizing, and doesn't make my skin break out. I didn't see a significant difference in the brightness of my skin or the appearance of my wrinkles, but it does make my skin feel silky and smooth which I love. Will continue to use this as part of my skin routine. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have combination skin and this product has helped moisturize my dry areas without making my more oily areas greasy. Especially during the winter my skin shows the rough weather but after testing this for the past month I am very happy with how smooth and clear my skin is.
I recoved this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this free from influenster about 3 weeks ago, I use it in the morning and at night in conjunction with the hyaluronic acid serum. I love the packaging setup and I think it's made a slight difference in the tone of my skin. It's not as instantly brightening or hydrating as I would like, but over time it has made a difference. I like the warming effect it has because it brings out a little more color to my skin to revive it a little more, and it makes my skin feel nice and soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This serum was unlike any I've tried before, being a thicker cream. I almost feel like that was a downside because it didn't feel like it absorbed into my skin quite as well as other vitamin c serums I have used. That said, it felt very moisturizing. I didn't notice significant brightening in the month I used it though. It didn't cause me to break out, which is great because many products do."
I received this product complimentary from Influenster for reviewing purposes.
"I've been using this for about a month now, and I honestly don't think it's been long enough to see a huge difference in my skin.

"I got this item in an Influenster voxbox. I'm so glad i got to try it, i have seen an improvement in my skin. I actually mix it with another revitalift products twice a day.

"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I have used the product for about a month and really like it so far. The formula took getting used to and I thought it would make my face greasy, but it is actually the opposite! Which is a nice change for my oily skin. I've noticed my breakouts decrease and feel fresher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was skeptical of trying this product because in the past I've had some pretty harsh skin reactions to similar products. Well, to my great surprise, this serum glides on like velvet, and I've had no sensitive reactions to it at all. It's definitely made my skin feel less dull and smoother even. I tried this products comolimentsry from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have been contemplating adding a Vitamin C serum to my beauty routine so it was perfect when I received this in the mail! I did notice a reduction in the fine lines in my forehead.

I will purchase in the future when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary from influenster for review and I loved it!

"I was sent this via Influenster and L'Oréal for review, and I am so glad I was!

"I've been using for about three weeks and can see some difference. When applied, it immediately gives the appearance and texture of super smooth skin. Almost acts like a primer so it's great before makeup. As for the actual health of my skin, I do notice that It's brighter and more glowy. Great product, I'm enjoying it."

I try to use a vitamin c every day to help give me radiance and to lighten my dark spots on my face. I love that this is a thicker serum so it gives me a little extra moisture.

I did receive this product complimentary for testing purposes.

I already use the Revitalist exfoliating cleanser and love it. So when I received this product I was very excited. My skin is brighter since adding this to my daily routine. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate my skin at all. I will continue to use this product regularly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product has a beautiful texture and goes on really smooth. It leaves my skin baby soft. I've haven't been using it long enough to see a visible change in the brightness of skin. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and I'm curious to see if it oxidizes after a few months.
"This right here, is amazing! I love how good it feels on my skin, that warm sensation you get while applying is seriously the best! I use it every night and I wake up to skin looking Soo good! I got this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product once a day (at night) after the hyalyronic acid step for about a month and it makes my skin feel so soft. A VERY tiny amount goes a long way. I will continue using this to see if it helps with my redness.

"Product works great, I have a few fine line & uneven skin tone. I used this products 2 times a day for the past 20 ish days. I almost instantly say a difference with my looking very smooth. My only complaint would be the price, I received this product from influenster free for testing purposes but will highly consider buying it once it's out [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this about 3 weeks ago free to test out. I've been using it for about 2 weeks, as a part of my night time routine, and I can definitely see a difference. My skin looks more radiant and soft, smooth even. It didn't break me out, and I have sensitive, acne prone skin. I would definitely recommend this product to someone who is looking for radiance without an oily appearance to their skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this complimentary from @influenster and started using it in conjunction with the pure hyaluronic acid, and after a month I'm seeing a difference in the fine lines on my eyes and forehead as well as an overall firmer skin and smoother appearance!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for several weeks now and can say that I do notice a difference with the texture of my skin and my skin is less dry overall. I like how it mattes down and does not leave a sticky feeling on the skin. The thing I like the least would be the smell. However, it's not that over powering that it would cause me personally to not use the product with the results I've seen. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this & the Revitalift HA serum, applying AM & PM. I notice a difference in my skin's appearance. My complexion looks more even and brighter. I do like the subtle warming feel upon application. My skin is combo oily so I'm always concerned about products causing more oily or breakouts. This product is easily absorbed into my skin. I'm looking forward to see future results. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have noticed after usuing the product twice a day for almost a month that my skin is looking brighter and my dark spots that have been there for years have slowly begin to fade.

I got this sent to me from Influenster complimentary about a month ago and I started using it right away. I use it at night and I let it sink into my skin before I put my moisturizer on. It leaves my skin feeling super hydrated especially with this cold weather!
"I tried this product in place of my Kiehls powerful strength serum. This product is best used during your night time routine as it causes makeup to bunch up/peel off on your skin if you use it in the morning. I enjoy the price point, but will not be switching to this product. I think this is a good option for someone just starting their skin care journey. Side note: I did receive this product for reviewing purposes and did not purchase."
I received this as a complementary gift to try from Influenster and I'm absolutely blown away how well it works. Being a over-the-counter brand I didn't have high hopes. But it left my skin feeling rejuvenated and fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This serum has brightened and smoothed my skin. After I wash my face, I let it air dry then put this on. I do this morning and evening and can't believe this results I've had within the first week.

"This really helped even out my skin! I'm always pretty leery of skin care products from the drugstore, but this really shocked me at how well it worked! My skin is very acne prone and sensitive and I didn't have any breakouts of reactions to it. In fact, my skin looks clearer and more even than it has in a while!

"I received this product free for review from Influenster and have been using it about a month. I definitely could tell a difference in the softness of my skin. It plumped my skin after using it. It didn't really ""change"" my skin. If I missed something day my skin was very dry and lost that suppleness. I keep up with my skincare routine, so it's not really issue, just something to note if that's what you're looking for. You can't beat the results for the price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary from influenster however it seems to be a great addition to my skincare routine. I'm not sure I see a huge difference for younger plumper skin but when I forgot to use it my skin just seemed less glowy and healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this about a month ago and am completely obsessed. My skin has never looked or felt better especially given the cold windy weather that usually dries out my combination skin. Love it and would highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used this product for about 3 weeks now. So far no complaints. It makes my skin feel a little better but nothing revolutionary. But I think with products like this you need to use it consistently for a while to actually notice something. I did receive this complimentary for testing purposes.
I use this in the morning and it is great! Really wakes up my skin and makes it bright. I've been using it for about a month and there is a noticeable difference in discoloration. I received this from Influenster for testing purposes and I am so thankful. Will purchase.
I honestly haven't been using this serum as consistently as I should too render a true opinion of the benefits of this product. But the three times that I have used it I have noticed that my skin appeared to be glowing somewhat it had a Sheen to it that I appreciate it. I will use this consistently at night for two weeks and come back and post my true experience. I was sent this product complimentary for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have combination skin so when trying new face products always worry about them being oily. Not the case with this one. The serum is more a creamy lotion than serum and feels really nice. A little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is an affordable option to a lot of department store pricy options. I like that It has pure vitamin C and makes my face feel healthy. Smells nice and over time will have results. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I must admit that when I recieved this product from #influenster I was skeptical. But after using it at applying the silky smooth cream to face I was transformed.

"I received this for free from Influenster to test out and review. That aside I've been using this now for a few weeks and have noticed brightening and more firmness in my face.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used this product a handful of times but I'm not sure what effect it hasn't on my skin? It hasn't had any adverse skin effects either. I guess I'll keep using it and see. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this product complimentary for review courtesy of Infuenster. I was so excited to try a vitamin c product as I feel like they are all the rave in more recent years. This was great to my sensitive skin and I'm so glad about that! I used this mostly at night although packaging states it can be used am & pm. I woke up with such soft skin!

Received this products compliments of Influenster. Used it day and night for a couple of weeks and my skin was softer and had a nice glow. A little bit goes a long way and I like the slight tingle you feel when you apply it. The sleek tube is great for packing into my makeup kit with the many other items I try to pack in there when I travel. I love that it's paraben free and fragrance free.

I wasn't sure what to expect but I did enjoy it ! I will say I liked it in combination with the hyalunoic acid . I received both items for free from Influenster. The only thing is I wish the packaging was better . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've had the pleasure of using this along with the hyaluronic acid serum for a month and I have no complaints. This serum is soft, pro- you don't need a lot and I've noticed no skin sensitivity. My skin looks great bare or with makeup. I'm 30 and feel like my skin is at its prime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'd give this five stars but the scent is a huge miss for me. It's hard to explain the scent itself, just unpleasant. The texture and noticeable difference in skin is amazing I've been going about my days with no makeup on. I would highly recommend this to anyone who has begun a beauty regimen. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes."
This product I love on its own however when I paired it with other products I found that it beaded up. It has a weird reaction when I use it with the Hyloronic Acid serum. I received both complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received the revitalift derm intensives pure vitamin c concentrate for free from influenster. So far I really like it. It makes my skin super soft & my makeup went on so well after using. I really enjoy the warming sensation too. I definitely needed something more for my skin lately since the cold is wreaking havoc on my face. I would recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am so happy that L'Oréal sells a vitamin c serum! It has been added into my daily regimen and you can't beat the price compared to other brands. So far I am liking the idea of a vitamin c serum for the added benefits it is supposed to do for your skin but I haven't noticed too much of a difference yet. I am hoping to see some results soon!

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product for about two weeks and honestly didn't notice much difference in terms of radiance or reducing wrinkles (maybe they are too deep and need more time). I do love how smooth it is when putting it on—almost feels greasy how easy it goes on, but doesn't make skin feel greasy. I'm not going to give up though. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free for reviewing purposes from L'Oreal and Influenster. To preface, my skin generally does not respond well to Vitamin C serums (I've tried several higher end products). When I tried this product, I expected the same results. I saw some similiar results (a small break out) but nothing horrible. This Serum didn't work for me, but my skin doesn't agree with the products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for about a month and I am very pleased with the product! It feels like butter, and it doesnt cause me to break out like a lot of similar products.

"L'Oreal does it again! I've been using this product for only a few days, and I love it! I used to use L'Oreals collagen cream along with L'Oreals Rosy Tone cream. Now I use the Vitamin C and Rosy Tone. My skin seems to be brighter and more vibrant! Thank you L'Oreal for great skin care products!"

I have been using this for 3 weeks now. I honestly have not seen a change in my skin at all. It's a nice product and I like the way my skins feels. It leaves it nice and soft without the shine but it doesn't reduce fine lines. Not after three weeks at least. I recieved this product free to try out form Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first began using this, I did notice some heat from the product, although not a burning sensation. I began noticing my skin looking more even, less red, and more radiant, which in honestly did not expect since I have been using other vitamin C products that did not have the same effect. Really impressed by this little guy! I did receive this complimentary but will purchase when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this product free to test from Influenster, and I have to say I've been so impressed!

Awesome addition to my daily skincare routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the texture because it feels so smooth on my face, but it took a little over 2 weeks to begin to see any results. Granted, skin care works differently for everyone, but I had stopped using a liquid Vitamin C serum that has 20% Vitamin C compared to this lotion based 10% form. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I've been using this for about 3 weeks now and I do like it, but i wish it was more lightweight. The consistencey is thicker than other vitamin c serums and it's a little sticky. Overall, i have noticied a difference in evening my complexion and I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this as a complimentary product to test it out. It feels so nice on my face, goes on so smooth. My skin feels very moisturized, not dried out (so important to me.) and it's a win when my skin doesn't start to itch. I see visible change in my skin after using it for a week. Definitely recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this complimtary and having been using it diligently for the past three week. I will say after you first apply it it will definitely blue and fade lines/ wrinkles, however, I have not noticed any texture differences long term. I like this and will continue using it but don't plan to purachse it moving forward. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am so impressed with this serum. It is so rich and hydrating without feeling heavy or greasy. It absorbs so beautifully. I've been using this nightly for the last three weeks and it has really made my skin look so bright and healthy. It feels supple and soft. I received this product for free to test out. I will be purchasing a tube when this is finished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product works great on my skin! I love how after applying, my skin feels so soft and looks matte. After about two weeks of usage, I do notice my skin looking a bit brighter. I received this product free as part of a promotional campaign through influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wow I love this product. It has a warm sensation when applying and I feel like it melts into my skin. It has a slight vitamin c type scent but very minimal and it smells fresh. It feels kind of like a thick serum but dries down to almost nothing. I've noticed firming, tightening and my skin has cleared up. It's only been a couple of weeks. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and I plan to purchase it when I run out. My skin looks awesome!!"
"I typically have pretty sensitive skin, but found this product worked pretty well with it! It definitely did have a warming effect, so don't freak out, but as a whole I like it a lot and would recommend. I got some compliments on my complexion. I received this product complimentary through Influenster's voxbox program but my views are my own! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Received this as a complimentary product from Influenster and have been trying it for the last three weeks. I unfortunately have been experiencing adult acne and issues I never had as as a teen. Due to the acne I have scars and lots of dark spots. This has helped lighten up the scars and I have seen a huge difference. Amazed at the results and will be repurchasing after I run out. It's up there with high end products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product for almost 2 weeks and I love how much brighter and even my skin tone looks! Can't wait to see it improve even more! I received this product free as part of a promotional campaign through Influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product for testing purposes and I was pleasantly surprised. I am a skincare nut and I believe in taking care of my skin now so it still looks great later. The product lived up to its promise and did not irritate my sensitive skin. Would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product. This made my face so soft and I honestly love it. I just do a few drops a day and rub them in and go to bed.

I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and my skin definitely feels more vibrant and plump. I like that Loreal decided to eliminate some harmful ingredients from this line. The texture is nice and the smell is not heavy. Skin feels soft and bright after use.

"I received this product for free through Influenster, and have been loving it. I have used other Vitamin C serums before that feel much heavier, and don't layer well. This one feels light (almost like a cross between facial moisturizer and primer) and has layered really well over other serums I've been using. It is too early for me to see specific results, but I know my skin loves vitamin C, so I am glad this one has been so easy to use. ALSO the packaging is ingenious for vit C [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been trying this product out for a few weeks now and though I don't think the product is bad, I didn't see any improved brightness or smoothing of any fine lines with this product. It didn't feel heavy but not particularly hydrating either. I think for the price point, there are other options with higher concentrations of vitamin c. I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my review of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am thoroughly impressed with this product. I love that it is fragrance free and I love how it makes my skin feel silky smooth. I also love that it is mattifying, as someone with oily skin. I haven't noticed a huge change in my skin, however, I've just started using it so hopefully I'll be seeing some changes soon! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this product for free from Influenster for testing purposes and will definitely buy this on my own later! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product for a few weeks before reviewing. I've seen a definite improvement in my skin's brightness. I used a stronger Vitamin C serum prior to this one, so I didn't experience any warmth or irritation. It glides on the skin beautifully and absorbs quickly. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.  [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This works as well as more expensive brands! My skin is not as dry.. love it. Especially during the colder seasons, when my skin becomes more parched. It absorbs quickly and did not leave any sort of a residue for me. Do let it dry before putting other products on. I would recommend this. It's a great value for the price. I do love the bottle it comes it. I did receive this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes but the opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This stuff is great! It has made a major difference in how my skin looks and feels. A little bit gots a long way - you only need to use about a pea-sized drop for your face meaning your product will last! I've used this in the morning and at night regularly for about a month and recommend it!
I received this serum from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a sample of this in my voxbox wih i fluenster and I am in love with it! My skin looks noticeably smoother and more vibrant on just a couple of weeks. I use it morning and at night time after washing my face. It's an awesome addition. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoy how my skin feels after using this. I like how fast it absorbs, and how it smells. It's very subtle and doesn't last long. I don't have any wrinkles per se so I can't vouch for how this diminishes them. But for preventative care I'd recommend this. I got this product complimentary from Influenster. All opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I like that you only have to use a very small amount of the product. It goes on well and does not leave my skin feeling tacky.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My face loves this stuff! I received this Vitamin C serum from Influenster for review purposes but boy do I love it. This serum is pure with the most amazing warming effect when it touches your skin!

I use this serum on my forehead lines (thanks kids) and I feel like it is definitely helping to improve them. It's obviously not Botox but I much prefer this gentler method over injections!

I received this about a month ago for free for testing purposes and I have to say I quite liked it. It did advise that a warmth may occur during application but I didn't notice any. It absorbed quickly into the skin and in my opinion did give me a bit more ‘joie de vivre' To my skin. Can't comment on the effect on wrinkles. Good value for the product. Would purchase in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this product a few weeks ago from Influenster for testing purposes and I have to say I actually really like it.

"I got this product complimentary for review purposes and girlfriend it's going to be a Yes from me! If you have a hard time with dark spots especiallly if you're skin is sensitive and your clear out your face yourself, this is a must in your arsenal of facial products. Not only does vitamin c bright your skin but it helps to lighten those pesky dark spots eventually making them vanish! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is like wow! A little bit goes a very long way. I love how it feels warm as you are putting on face. This is my new go to product. I got this for free from Influenster to test out but this does not affect my rating because this product just shocked me !

I received this for free from Influenster to review! I've been using it for a few weeks and I am only 25 so I don't have aging concerns that I would see a noticeable difference but am all about preventative measures. I really like the texture and it's super creamy and butter and it warms my face up which I really like! I'm hoping this will prolongue my youthful skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product did help with the dullness of my skin, however, it did make my skin feel incredibly oily and break out when I used a decent amount. I started using less of it, and it still made my skin radiant and didn't break out. Would definitely purchase this! I received this for testing purposes, in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this for about 3 weeks now and I've seen a visible improvement in the texture of my skin. I had some dark spots on y cheeks and it seems to have even lightened that! I did not expect to like it as uch as I do. I'd give it 5 stars except I don't really like the scent. I received this as a sample from Influenster and I am glad I did. It's affordable so I will definitely be repurchasing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Provides instant hydration and makes skin look more vibrant- looks like you've had a full night of sleep! The warming sensation is a little bit to get used to, but it's nice to tell it's working. My only complaint is it makes my makeup application slightly oilier. I received this product free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this concentrate from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I used it in conjunction with the 1.5% hyalauronic acid cerem morning and night for 3 weeks and noticed improvement in skin texture and tone. I did notice that it would break apart underneath my foundation at times during the day, so I have switched to just using at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very much enjoyed this product. My doctor mentioned the other day that I was “glowing” and I think it's becuse of this product. I found it slightly drying at first, but my skin soon adjusted.

I received this to try from Influenster. I wanted to like it but was ultimately indifferent. The warming sensation worries me a little because I have sensitive skin and usually that's a sign of a reaction. But it did make my skin look brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this serum complimentary from Influenster and I'm so glad. Normally a serum would be too oily for my skin but this one doesn't do that at all and if you where the cream that goes with it your face feels refreshed and tight. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for over two weeks and my sking is feeling good and hydrated. Every time I put in on, I feel like a light burning sensation and I believe that it isn't because is working. I am going to keep using it and see how my skin does. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how this product feels on my skin. While applying I felt a warming sensation which is normal for this product. I initially used it 2x a day and cut down to 1x because I was noticing whiteheads appear. I have decided to discontinue use because or the whiteheads. I would recommend this to anyone that does not have sensitive skin. I received this product complimentary to test. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product complimentary for review. I have been using it for about 3 weeks at first I did not see a difference but as I constantly used it on a daily basis I seen quite the difference.

"I got this product through influencer and it is one of my favorite things I have received from them! I have been using it on top of the pure hyaluric acid for about 2 weeks and can tell a major difference in my skin! It's clearer, has no dry spots (amazing with the weather changes), and looos alive! I've even stopped wearing foundation because my face looks so smooth from this. Will definitely purchase these two items when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster. This is my first L'Oréal skincare product I have ever used. My skin is in pretty good shape, but lacks brightness in the fall and winter. I've been using this product as instructed and my skin is looking really healthy! It also feels great after going on, it makes my skin feel and look very smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this product I noticed a huge improvement in the smoothness and radiance of my skin. I started noticing it only after a week and after using it for a few weeks now and I can't believe how glow-y and beautiful my skin looks. A little goes a long way too so it will last a while. I highly recommend you try it out, I will definitely be repurchasing. Although I received this product complimentary to try out, my opinions are my own. I really love this product!

"I received this product. complimentary for testing purposes. It's different from the vitamin c serums I've used in the past, which have been serums. I liked that the finish of the product is very smooth, almost like a primer. The effects are similar to other vitamin c serums I've used: smoother, brighter skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. I wasn't able to use this for more than a few days because I couldn't stand the smell of it! It claims to be fragrance free, but it smells like metal and multi vitamins. I thought it would eventually subside once the serum absorbed into my skin but it didn't and even after washing my face and hands it didn't go away immediately. I can't say whether it worked or not because it says to give it a week but I couldn't even do that."
I received this for complimentary testing purposes. I've used it for two weeks now and already the skin on my four head is more evenly town and my skin in general. With the hyaluronic acid serum just seems healthier and brighter if you do you have active acne like me do not put the CRM on those spots because it doesn't seem to help and May clog the pores of active pimples.

I liked that the finish of the product is very smooth, almost like a primer. The effects are similar to other vitamin c serums I've used: smoother, brighter skin. But I have to say that I hate the container. It doesn't stand up so it's always falling all over the place in my medicine cabinet. Would prefer a tube with a flat cap, or a bottle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wanted to use this product for at least a week before reviewing. I'll admit I was hesitant at first because there is a warning that it might have a warming sensation and I have sensitive skin. I didn't notice any warming or irritation at all. My skin is noticeably softer and feels incredibly smooth after one week's use. The uneven areas are a lot less noticeable also. I received this product for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary from influnster. Not sure what the hype is all about. It's thick, and honestly feels like I'm putting on chafing cream on my face. Not to mention, I used it 3 weeks before I wrote this review. I honestly wouldn't buy this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free in my Influenster VoxBox, but unfortunately it does not work for my skin. I used this as directed along with the hyaluronic acid and after a week my skin started breaking out like crazy...new breakouts daily! I've stopped using them and hope my skin gets back to normal soon. As for the product itself, it goes on very well and doesnt leave the skin feeling sticky or too oily. I did notice the slight warming sensation when I put it on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this serum along with the Hylaronic Acid serum and I have never gotten more compliments on my skin even with higher end items. The Vitamin C is thicker at first and then melts into the skin like butter. It calms my dry winter skin and relives it like chapstick for my eyes. Yesterday my boyfriend said I wish I had your undereyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product compliments of Influenster to try out. I really wanted to like this product as I really want to take care of my skin, especially since I'm no way in my early 30s.

"I received this serum complimentary and am highly impressed with the moisture and brightness it brings! I have combination skin and usually serums seem too greasy for my skin, but this formulation goes on smooth (but not greasy) and doesn't leave my skin feeling oily.

I received this complimentary from Influenster and I am super happy that I did. I have super sensitive and dry skin and it didn't cause any irritation or break outs.

"I received this through Influenster to test and review. I was surprised at how much I like this product! It quickly absorbed into my skin and left it feeling moisturized. It reminded me and gave me the same results (smaller pore size, more radiant skin) as Sunday Riley CEO at a fraction of the price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So I got this in my Influenster box last month, and I was super skeptical. I use a neutrogena night cream that I really haven't noticed a difference with, so I ditched it for the month and tried this. Let me tell you, within the first WEEK I noticed the difference. I love it and am definitely going to purchase it when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This made my skin so soft. It feels healthy and moisturized without making my skin too oily - a lifesaver in the cold weather.

Thank you @influenster and @LOrealParisUSA #RevitaliftDermIntensives #complimentary [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complementary from Influenster. I am definitely not one to be stingy with my compliments, I just genuinely wasn't impressed with this product. The directions tell you to apply a pea size amount to your whole face but it hardly rubs in enough to cover more than just my cheek. The consistency reminds me of cheap makeup primer and it made my face break out pretty badly. I was so excited to try this product, just sadly let down a bit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This stuff works really well! It's made my skin noticeably brighter and softer. I absolutely love it and will have it added to my skincare routine! I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product as a serum step I use at night! Vitamin C is great for the skin and I'm really impressed that it has 10% Vitamin C! My skin feels great after use and looks bright and fresh in the morning. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This has made my skin feel smooth and helped my complexion. Very lightweight but usually by the morning my face was a little greasy. Not sure if it was my error. But I will continue to use the product to see how my skin changes over time. I use it before bed. It says to use with other revitalift products but doesn't tell you the order, which I wasn't a fan of since it was my first time using this type of serum. I did receive this complimentary for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review of it. I was not impressed with this product. It is very heavy and does not seem to do much. I don't like how it makes my skin feel. I will not be purchasing this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this as a complementary product for testing purposes. I used this, along with the L'Oreal 1.5% Pure Hyaluronic Acid, twice a day (morning and night) for two weeks an I most definitely see a difference in my skin! The texture of my skin has improved dramatically. It looks brighter and more youthful. I will absolutely be re-purchasing this product to continue using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this compliments of Influenster. And I love it! I use it whenever I feel my skin is looking tired. I see immediate smooth results and my skin feels so bouncy the next morning. I will be purchasing this when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The packaging allows for a high quality suspension. Slight warm sensation when I apply it and I definitely notice that I'm more “glowy” afterward. And as a bonus it's a great primer for makeup! I received this product complimentary through Influenster but I would buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this consistently morning and night since receiving it. At first I was skeptical because I wasn't seeing results, however over time I think it did help improve the brightness of my skin and helped minimize dark spots. I'm not sure it will replace my old vitamin C serum, but I would purchase with if you've never tried vitamin c products before! Overall pretty impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product daily for about 3 weeks now. I like that it has a clean, neutral scent and the slightly warm feeling it has when you put it on. It didn't cause any negative reactions to my sensitive skin (such as causing breakouts, leaving my skin feeling greasy - nothing like that.) I wouldn't say that I noticed any difference, though, in reducing wrinkles or any visible benefits. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've tried vit c serums before and always felt like nothing was happening but this product changed the game. Even right after the 1st application my skin just looked healthy had a glow and such a light weight product felt like I had nothing on. My skin is not brighter and the tone is even my hyperpigmentation has also gotten lighter it's officially in my skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product worked great on my fine yet noticeable forehead lines. After 3 weeks of using the lines were less noticeableIt's effective yet gentle on my skin. I received this product for free in exchange for my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this serum for about 2.5 weeks. I immediately noticed a difference in how my skin felt. After consistent use, I notice my skin looks brighter and I have a more even skin tone. I have some cars from skin picking and haven't noticed any difference in them, though. I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this complimentary from influenster and I cannot be more happy that I got this.. at first I was iffy to try but when I tried I loved it because the tingles made my face feel tight and I notice firmness on my skin after about a week of using both morning and night! I am in my late 20S And am on a mission to keep my skin as radiant and youthful as long as I can!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product a couple weeks ago and I am in love with it. I also used the Hyaluronic acid serum, and My skin instantly felt so hydrated & refreshed. This product was received complimentary thanks to Influenster, but will continue to buy for my skincare routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Okay so I received this in the mail in exchange for my unbiased review, and I feel so many different ways about it. I love the effects of it and how it seems to make any dark spots or red spots go away. But it smells so weird!!! No matter what I do I can't get the smell to go away. I don't know if perfect skin is worth smelling so unpleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary to try for a month. Overall I love the product. It made my face really smooth and soft after using it. However, I do not like the packaging. I would rather something that doesn't release as much product and is able to stand on my vanity. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this and the Revitalift Hyaluronic Acid Serum for free from Influenster, and I'm so glad I did! My skin is super soft, and seems brighter. At almost 27, I wanted to get started on a preemptive anti-aging routine, and with quality cost-effective products like these, I feel like I can stick with it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. I never used this product alone, I used it along with the Derm Intensives 1.5% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum so my review is based on the duo. I think the products together are great and seemed to brighten my sign the only problem I had was I seemed more oily throughout the day. I would recommend using the duo at night if you don't want to me oily during the day from using the duo in the AM [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product feels emollient when placed on the skin and takes a few seconds before it absorbs. There is not a noticable or strong scent. Once you puncture the container for product to come out, it has a tendancy to come out fast when opened after so be careful. I didnt notice any drastic changes when using this. I recieved this complimentary for testing and review purposes."
Now that it's getting colder I feel like my skin is getting more dull and dry. This serum gives a nice boost of vitamin c. Within a week I noticed my skin looking rejuvenated and more fresh. I really enjoy this product!
"I received this product from Influenster for free, however, my opinion on it is 100% my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this product. It was hydrating and my skin was more supple after each use. My skin looked tighter which was great. Definitely going to keep this as part of my skin care routine. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I've tried this product out for about 2 weeks now. I do notice that it does gives good moisture to my eye area and I would wake up looking more refreahed and less tired. I have noticed a change in my fine line quite yet, but do noticed that my skintone appears more even. I would recommend this product to those looking for a reasonable price eye serum [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary, BUT I will be repurchasing over and over again. The formula feels amazing upon initial contact of the skin. Also, I've been seeing instant results. My skin is noticably smoother and firmer. I could go on and on about this product but you should just go pick some up and try it for yourself!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product a few weeks back & am in love with it. Paired with the Hyaluronic acid serum, my skin has never felt so hydrated & refreshed. I love it & will continue to use it. This product was received complimentary thanks to Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
On the first day of use I could instantly feel the difference in my skin. The serum is light weight but so potent. Pairing this with serum with the hyloranic acid oil is the best combo with the cold weather approaching. My skin loves me because of these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wow it's been so cold in Houston and I'm so glad I have this serum to help my skin. The cold wind makes my skin feel and look dull. But with this vitamin c serum, it makes my skin feel firmer and younger! My tip is to use just a small amount because A small drop goes a long way! I received this product for free to test. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product about a month ago and have been really pleased with the results! Combined with the hyaluronic acid, this makes your skin super soft and subtle. I did receive this product complimentary for testing purposes but would buy again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for over a week now and it feels amazing! My skin feels refreshed! I have yet to notice any reduction in wrinkles but I am keeping my hopes up.
*I did receive this product complimentary for testing purposes but my review was based on my experience. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I honestly didn't have too many high expectations for this, but I was so pleasantly surprised after using it for a week ! My skin was so soft and and felt so rejuvenated and bouncy ! The serum was so smooth and felt light and didn't leave my feeling greasy. It helped to even out my skin and my blotchy spots slowly started to even out ! I would highly recommend this product ! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this through Influenster and have tried it for one month. Overall I am not impressed. It brightened my skin a bit but nothing too noticeable. My friend really enjoys this product so I think it is just my skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Have been using this serum for a couple weeks now after receiving this complimentary, my skin looks brighter and feels great. They warn you about a tingling feeling at first but it goes away fairly quickly. Would definitely purchase this product after I'm done with my sample [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and found that it helped my complexion almost immediately. The only downside was that it practically dissolved as soon as I put it on my hand prior to putting it on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This vitamin c serum is amazing. I have been using it for about a month and my skin is glowing. I've used other vitamin serums but they don't compare to this one. I was sent this product for testing purposes but I will definitely be purchasing when I run out!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product as a free sample to review. It felt very nice and smooth, like a primer. But I did not get the effects of that it markets. I like the warming affect but have not seen a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this cream from Influenster for free for testing purposes and so far I'm loving it. I used it along with the serum and it leaves my sling very hydrated and it's also removing some of my acne marks!!! The only bad thing is that my face starts to get oily after a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have religiously been using this vitamin c serum for about 2 weeks. It makes my skin feel very soft and look bright and dewy. I am hoping that with continued use it helps with my forehead wrinkles. They might have got a little better but they started off super bad so I'm sure it's goibg to take more time or Botox lol! i received this product free for testing purposes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked the feel and the texture of this serum but it was too thick for me. It clogged my pores and cause a couple breakouts within the month I had used it. I've never had a serum or anything really do that to my skin before. I did continue to use it for a little while after breaking out for any firming results and nothing really changed. I received this product free for testing and reviewing purposes from Influenster. All thoughts and comments are completely my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product really moisturizes the skin and makes it feel so smooth and hydrated. It has a warming feel when applying it but it goes away quickly. It does have a kind of weird smell but it's tolerable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Even with super sensitive skin and only using this product once a day, I noticed a massive difference in my skin's clarity and in my fine lines in just a week! Super impressed and can't wait to see what's to come even just a few weeks from now."
(I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. All opinions are my own.) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this a few weeks ago and I'm in love with it. It makes my skin feel really soft and I've actually have used it as a primer under my makeup and it works great for that too. I can definitely tell that it brightens my skin over time because of the vitamin c. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes, but all opinions on it are my own."
Influenster sent me this Vitamin C serum complimentary 2 weeks ago for me to test out and review. This serum feels so good on my skin. The consistency makes it easy to apply and it gives my skin a natrual glow. My skin feels moisturized and ready for my day. I also love that it's fragrance free and in an easy to squeeze tube. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product for testing purposes from Influenster. All opinions are my own. I have combination and this products works well to keep my skin oiled but not over producing oil which is a problem. My skin was visibly different after a few uses. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this for a few days now and I already see a difference in my skin! I was pleasantly surprised by this serum. It has a soft silky texture and for a drugstore brand, it can't be beat! I wouldn't have guessed it would work this well. I received this complimentary from influenster to review but opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product I love how it has a warm feel when it goes on the skin. The only thing I don't like is the residue. Even if I apply just a tiny bit, if I rub my face in anyway a it creates a white residue. Not sure if I'm just not applying it right or I need to wait for it to dry longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. The product is light weight and didn't have a strong smell. I used this along with the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Derm Intensives 1.5% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum. My skin felt firmer. However, are using both products I still felt the need to use a moisturizer and prefer a morning routine with less products/steps. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free from Influenster. I have been using it twice a day for almost two weeks. I feel like my skin is clear, bright and hydrated. I plan to continue using this product and recommend to anyone looking for a vitamin c serum! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest opinion.
"I only used this product under my eyes and freckles/sun spots. After a week of use, I started to notice a slight difference in dark spots. Under my eyes looked brighter after using it at night and in the am. I love that this product is now paraben, fragrance and dye free!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Overall this is a great serum. I used it day and night for a week. I do feel like it made my skin brighter. Can't say much about wrinkles as I don't have much right now. The only thing I don't like is the scent. It smells like nail polish to me...very chemical smell. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a free sample and so far I love the results. My skin feels and looks brighter 1 week into using it. I pair this with the hyaluronic acid and I can already tell this will be a lifesaver for the Upcoming Midwest winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have received this product from influenster and I gotta say I am very surprised. I've ever used a product like this before and I was very hesitant because I wasn't sure if there was any side effects. This product has brighten up my skin and feels smoother than ever. I will be purchasing this product once I'm done with mine [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Very impressed by the formulation of this product! Vitamin C serums are hard to stabilize and therefore not always effective. This formulation and packaging make this serum super potent and effective! Lastly, the price point can't be beat compared to high end vitamin c serums on the market! I received this product complimentary from Influenster in exchange for my feedback. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using the serum for 7 days I've noticed that my hyperpigmentation marks are lighter and texture a bit smoother on my cheeks. Be careful not To use more than you need. A little bit goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recently received this from Influenster to try and I have to say I am NOT disappointed. I decided to stop using any serums I was using before (Lancôme genifque) and I have to say I am LOVING the results. My skin is dewy, plump and glowing which is great considering winter is right around the corner here in Illinois. I would absolutely recommend to everyone! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I like this product after getting it from Influenster. It worked well but I didn't see super immediate results. I will likely use my Ole Henriksen serum.
I gave this to my mom and she really likes it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this as a complimentary item through Influenster, and I love it. I use it in conjunction with the vitamin c serum, and it makes my skin soft and it's feels more right overall. The product really has no smell and it goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've heard about this kind of product but never tried it before. I'm impressed! I've been using it for the past two weeks, in the morning and evening, without putting makeup on my face all day long. I could feel my skin fresh, soft and not oily at all. And I loved that! Also, I really could see a difference in my skin (looks more firm, smoother and brighter). I definitely recommend this product! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this free from influenster to test and wow. It is really good my skin feels fresher and I look less tired. Others have asked why I'm glowing and it's only been a few weeks. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants that fresh I just got 9 hours of sleep and I'm feeling great look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was my first time using this product and I mainly used it on my cheeks. It has kept my skin very soft and smooth. I have been able to apply my foundation over it with no problems. My skin is very sensitive and I did not have any issues after using this serum. I'd recommend this to anyone wanting to try out a serum, the price point is fantastic. I received this product complementary in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this product to test for free and have been using it for several weeks. My skin feels smooth, I see less wrinkles and appears brighter. It is thick, similar to primers I have used. Only downside is sometimes it leaves a clumpy residue. Always have to double check before I leave the house! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Soo far I've been using this for a couple of weeks. I've seen some results. I'm 29 so I don't have many wrinkles but it's good as well as a preventative. I've used this and the hyaluronic acid serum. I've seen some results of fading dark circles which is great so I don't look so dead. I'm am so thankful i received this product complimentary from influenster. Getting to try new products and telling people about it is amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for two weeks now. The product itself goes on thick and kind of sticky. I have tried using less or more but still I just don't like the way my skin feels. Especially when applying my makeup. I got this product free to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a complimentary of this item and I feel like it makes my skin tight and brand new with very little lines to be shown. Although I'm still pretty young but those under eye bags and slight crows feet have come and gone. I feel like I'm in my early 20s rather than 30s! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a sample to test and have been really impressed so far. I think it's actually helping my dark spots from acne and such! It helps smooth my skin and it's lgiht enough for day but moisturizing enough for night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"You only need a little bit of this Vitamin C serum, which is good because there is a warming effect and that could feel strange if you aren't expecting it! Overall it didn't cause me to break out and I think it made my skin a bit brighter too."
I received this product complimentary from Influenster for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have even using this serum for almost three weeks and I can honestly say I am seeing a difference in my skin! I had small smile lines around my mouth and they have decreased dramatically! I don't love the smell of the serum (almost chemical smell) but it doesn't linger.
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes, but I would buy when it runs out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really wanted to love this product but unfortunately it didn't do well with my skin. It left a sticky residue and the smell isn't like other vitamin c serums I've used, that we're more effective. I received this product complementary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the feel of this serum. It's lightweight, seeps into my skin, doesn't leave a greasy residue. It's very moisturizing. I haven't noticed any real changes in my skin with the exception of my dry spots being gone but it leaves my face very soft. I received this product free but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have very sensitive skin and I often have bad reactions to low quality vitamin C products. This caused no burning like other products have caused. I love the warmth when applying it and it makes my skin look amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how this product makes my skin glow. At first I thought it would be harsh on my skin because of the vitamin C since I have sensitive skin but no! It was actually great! I gave it 4 stars because it flakes a bit and leaves some residue. I recieved this product as a free sample from influenster to test it and write my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the truth.... after the first use my skin felt so soft! Only time will tell but I have high hopes for this product. I have sensitive skin and this product didn't upset it at all. My only wish is that their products came with better instructions, i.e what order to use this line, or that their site was easier to access."
I received this product free for reviewing purposes. But I always give an honest review! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster. I absolutely fell in love with it from the very first time I used it. I used this serum every morning for a week just to the results and my skin definitely showed improvement. I got so many compliments on how bright and awake my skin looked. I also loved that is was similar to a lotion consistancy. This is a great product that I will continue to use. Once this one runs out I will actually go purchase one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now. It really has lightened up my skin tone and my husband said that my skin looked radiant. My skin did experiece the warming effect that was mentioned in the side effects, but it was not overwhelming. I wish the packaging explained the serum more and the effects it has on the skin. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this item from influenster a few weeks ago. I have been using it religiously for about a week. I usually don't like serums and my skin is abit dry and I want my moisturizer to smoth out my face so my foundation doesn't not look “Cakey.” That being said, the product is great and I am sure someone with a skin a bit more oily would love it. I like it but again, the moisturizer works better for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was definitely able to notice a radiance and suppleness to my face with using this. It has no smell which was definitely a bonus to me and it didnt cause me to break out like everything else. I definitely recommend this. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this as a complimentary full-size sample for product testing purposes from Influenster and have been using it for about two weeks now. I use it twice daily in combination with the Derm Intensived 1.5% pure hyluronic acid serum. I enjoy the way this product feels on my skin, but I do think it does make my skin feel a bit more oily than usual so I have cut down to just using it at night. Otherwise, it is a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was given this product complimentary from Influenster. While I enjoy the rich velvety consistency of the product, I am a bit put off by the hellacious smell that emanates from the bottle on to your hand and face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"VoxBox sent me the the L'Oreal Paris Revitalist Derm Intensive Vitamin C Serum free. I used it at morning and at night on facial skin. It did act quite quickly. My skin has been so dry in cold weather lately and this serum quickly evened the moisture on my skin. However, I had a bit of residue and the moisture didn't last long compared to products I've used in the past. For that reason, I would no pick it over my current products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Some background on my skin: 26 y/o, fair skinned, main concerns are acne and dullness, combination skin. I was previously using a similar vitamin C serum by a prestige brand and saw some results particularly with brightness. This product does the same thing at a much more affordable price. I would recommend! And as someone whose skin is accustomed to top-of-the-line skincare products, that should tell you something. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This serum is wonderful. I like to apply this serum every morning and night to my face followed by the hylaronic acid serum! My skin feels softer already just days of using it. I do find that if I dont apply the hylaronic serum after that my face feels a bit sticky. Maybe I'm using too much?! This is a great product! I received this product complementary for testing purposes!
I recieved this product from Influenster for testing purposes. I use this as directed every morning and night and have seen quite a difference! My skin is glowing and feel baby soft. It has a slight warming sensation but I don't mind it. It goes on very smooth and is pretty light weight so it's not noticable. Would recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I will definitely be continuing use of this. I received this complimentary to test out from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been really enjoying this serum over the last several weeks. It doesn't feel too heavy on the skin, but still feels deeply nourishing. It also provides a really nice smooth base if you're using during the day and applying makeup on top. I still am curious to see the long term results, but so far I feel like I have less texture on my skin overall. This product was sent to me complimentary for review purposes but all opinions expressed are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for a couple weeks. So far, I'm really liking the way it has made my skin look and feel. It's not greasy or oily and you only need a small amount of product to cover your entire face. I would definitely recommend trying this! I did receive this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary for review. Whoa - immediately impressed. You need very little to get the results you want. Skin feels silky smooth after application. My skin looks brighter and feels amazing after consistent AM and PM use. As a mom of 3 kids under 4 I need all of the easy anti aging products I can. This makes the cut and comes at an amazing price! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was great! I wasn't sure what to expect but it gives your skin a glow. Because you use so little I was worried I was going to have to use other face lotion but it did a great moisturizing!
I received this product complimentary. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product to test. It's a very interesting product in that it makes your face warm when you first apply it. I did notice my skin was a bit brighter after using for a bit, but I wouldn't reccomend using it twice a day. It was too intense using it that much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product leaves my skin feeling very moisturized and smooth. Contrary to other reviews, it does feel somewhat heavy to me. I have oily and acne prone skin and this did not create excess oil or cause any breakouts. You do feel a warm sensation for a moment after applying it, but it warns you about that on the package. I would definiteky recommend this product. I reveived this product for free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved this item as complimentary for testing - I noticed upon application your skin feels really warm and tingly but it goes away. You feel that soft skin and doesn't make your skin look oily. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I recieved this concentrate along with the hylarunic acid serum complimentary for testing purposes. I've been using it for around a few weeks. This serum has silicone texture. I'm not sure how I feel about that. It's something I used to love but now it makes me think of pore filling primers instead of good skincare. With that being said, it does make my skin feel extremely soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tested this product through Influenster and I can't believe how great it works! After one week using this product a friend told me that my skin was glowing!

Ive been using this daily for several weeks now and have noticed no difference in my skin. Perhaps I'll notice with long term results. It hasn't broken my skin out so I'll continue to use the tube up and see if there is a difference in another few months. It's easy to use but doesn't feel particularly smoothing on your skin. I received this complimentary from influenster in exchange for my unbiased opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I also love that my acne scarring has really lightened up in the 3 weeks I have been using this. I also have not had any major breakouts!! I'm not oily after applying,I love this serum!

This serum has been changing lots of things on my face for me that I was not expecting to (in a good way!). I have a lot of sun spots and freckles on my face and have been trying to find the right product to help reduce the impurities.

I have been using this for almost 2 weeks and I swear it is lightening the 2 sun spots I have on my face! I love that this has zero scent added to it. It does feel a bit heavy on the skin, but not so much that I can't use it on my combo skin. I will definitely continue to use this!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am Vitamin C fan because I have acne scars and dull skin. This contains 10% pure Vitamin C and not like other Vitamin C serum this sinks into the skin and have velvet feeling. I can feel the warmth when applying and I think it helps the product to sink in the skin easily.
I recieved this product complimentary for testing purpose.

"I recieved this product from Influenster a couple of weeks ago and have enjoyed it overall. The texture of this product is lovely, and it has improved the texture of my skin as well.

"Talk about a game changer in drugstore skincare! It's exciting to see all of these changes. This was super easy to add to my morning routine and didn't interfere with my makeup.

All thoughts are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was sent this by influenster for my honest review and opinion. First let me say I have a sensitivity to vitamin C. There are very few that dont make me go red. This one does not. Its so good.

I use it in the morning and night, and I think this is what I was missing in my skin routine to take care of my skin!"
"I have been using this for about two weeks now and I'm really enjoying the product! It goes on the skin nicely, does not cause piling with my other steps, and has not broken out my temperamental skin. I haven't noticed any brightening effects yet, but it's a little early to tell. It does apply very smooth and I like the texture a lot! I did receive this complimentary for testing purposes but this is something I would definitely consider repurchasing!

I received this product for review from Influenster to review. I used it every night and morning for a little over a week and saw great results.

Yet another excellent skin care product from L'Oreal Paris. The serum feels great going on with a subtle warming effect. Absorbs quickly. I was a bit concerned the serum would be too much for my sensitive skin but it's been great and has caused zero issues. And my skin looks & feels great!

I started out using this at night with the hyaluronic acid drops also from Revitalift but with moisturizer the 3 seemed to just sit on my skin rather than absorbing so I switched this to day. I used it for about 10 days before moisturizer like a serum but I haven't noticed a difference in my skins appearance.

I woke up in complete WOW after using the vitamin C concentrate! I have battled winkles in my forehead for years and I am only in my early 30's. I felt nothing was working but truly after using it for awhile now my wrinkles are starting to go away and my skin has never felt so smooth and glowing! I did receive this item complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I waited a little over a week to review this product and I really noticed a difference! My skin had some uneven tones because I had experienced some pretty bad acne a few months ago.

I use this right before I moisture. *i recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes* [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this about 2 weeks and can see some changes in my skin. It looks smoother and “fresher”.

I received this as a freebie to sample and evaluate. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this everyday in the morning during my regular skincare regimen (toner, serum, moisturizer, primer) for about 2 weeks. My skin feels moist, and I saw very little change in my fine lines. Overall I would recommend this as a treatment w moisturizer and serum if you have skin or dry patches. The value is incredible compared to so many others! I received this complimentary to test for my honest opinion from Influenster x L'Oréal Paris. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as a sample for testing through Influenster. I've been using it for about a week now and I can say, so far, results are slow. I was so genuinely pleased by it's lack of odor, just as promised. Very smooth but, application doesn't spread as much as I wished for. The box says for a certain amount to be used but I've been feeling like it's not enough. Packaging wise, love it and HIGHLY appreciate the sample of the actual size on the box.

"I received this product complimentary to try. I really like it. It degrades when it comes in contact with oxygen so it almost feels like it absorbs instantly into your face. Sometimes I don't like the feeling it leaves on my hands after, but just a quick rinse and that feeling is gone. My skin has looked so much better in the course of the week I've been trying it. There's a lot in the container so it'll last a while too so its probably worth the money! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The packaging for this product is really innovative and smart- vitamin c isn't very stable when exposed to air and it's great that this product stays sealed so well. It feels nice to apply, though it isn't moisturizing so you need a good moisturizer afterwards. I really enjoy this. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I must say as an esthetician, I'm very picky about my skincare products. I was hesitant to even try this in fear of having a weird reaction. I'm glad I tried it, I have been living for this stuff and the huyloronic acid drops. My skin feels AMAZING, cleared up some acne I had going on and overall making my skin look flawless! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as part of a Vox Box to sample. My first impressions are overall good of this 10% Vitamin C Serum. I would say it is more like a cream than a serum, since it comes out of the tube thicker than a ""regular"" clear serum. It did make my skin feel warm, like the box said, but it did not irritate my face in any way, and it absorbed quickly. I do notice a slight smell, but it does not bother me. Looking forward to trying it more over the next few weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received a free sample from Influenster to test, but this does not effect my review: This feels silky, but not oily. I didn't have any issues with burning or inflammation using this and sometimes my skin is very sensitive (esp in colder winter!) I've been using for about a week and can tell some difference in my skin. I don't wear makeup so mostly people have been commenting like ""you look different, what's different?"" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Received the Vitamin C Serum as a complimentary product from Influenster, and it's amazing! Prior to using L'Oreal, I was using a 5% Vitamin C product from a different brand which feels oily on my skin, but L'Oreal's product does feel that way. It's easy to apply and absorb quickly into the skin, and after a week of using the product, I notice more of a glow and a more even skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

However, I haven't noticed too much of a difference in my skin since beginning to use it about 10 days ago.

I received this item complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. First impression is niot that great. I feel like it's too thick for my skin to absorb.
