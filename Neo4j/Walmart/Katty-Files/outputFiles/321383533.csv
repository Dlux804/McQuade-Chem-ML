"I have tried other products that have not worked as well for me . Those products were not only more expensive but either dried out my face or left it with a ghostly pale cast to it under makeup. I really like that I can afford the product and that it does seem to last for just about 8 hours. I do wish it lasted all day, but 8 hours of feeling younger is pretty good....besides just reapply, right!! ]"
"Love love love. I purchased this product for myself but after my husband saw the results, I had to order a second bottle for him. You feel the difference in your skin almost instantly. Definitely worth it!"
"I've used this product for a long time and it never fails! I was really distraught a few months ago, when it appeared that it would no longer be available - and trying to find something that is comparable just isn't possible. I was delighted when I came across the 5-minute face lift on Walmart's site!"
It is perfect for me. I have been using it for years. Then it was unavailable. Glad it's back.
"Works as expected, I wouldn't say it works for 8 hours, more like 5."
It really works well but I was disappointed that the price doubled in less then a year.
The first bottle was good and the second bottle was dried up inside.
"tightens skin slightly, but leaves a clear shinny film and when you put your moisturizer on over it like the directions state it does not stay on as supposed to."
It did absolutely nothing I have use other products thereâs a thought I would try this one Iâll go back to the one Iâve been using. Waste of money and time
