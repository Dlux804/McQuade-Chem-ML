Spreads readily. Nice consistency. No strong fragrance smell. I use around my mouth and under my eyes. I've used the product two years. I live in a dry state. I need all of the help I can get.
"I'm not sure if it's this product or some of the other skin products that I've begun using recently that has my skin looking better than it's been in many years. 'Cosmetics is an art, skin care is a science' It's wonderful that they're able to bring some of peptides at amazing prices."
The ingredients are said to increase collagen production. Only been using a week. Still awaiting the results.
Absorbs in good but not sure it's doing anything??
I've used it for about 2 weeks but I dont see any change at all in my skin.
