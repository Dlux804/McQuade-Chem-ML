Best. Essence. Ever. Sad that they're discontinuing this version.
"Product arrived on time. Seller is an authorized distributor of MisshaUs so one can be assured that this is real. I'm 21 and have combination, acne-prone skin. After reading about how this product is an affordable dupe for the SK II essence my sister swears by, I decided to give Missha a try. I pat the essence on twice daily. My skin feels supple and hydrated, and I have not experienced any breakouts. I'd definitely recommend this to others."
