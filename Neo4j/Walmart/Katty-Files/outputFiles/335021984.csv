WoW....
I have only used it a wk n am already getting comps. On the way I look..
Highly recommended..Major kudos to Strivectin.
"For the last 4 weeks I've been using the Tightening & Sculpting Face Serum, 360 Tightening Eye Serum, Neck Serum Roller, Face Cream, and finish with the Neck Cream Plus twice a day. (all from the Tightening & Lift line). I'm 57 yo, and I noticed my skin tone was very much improved at week 3. At week 4 I have seen considerable tightening on my neck, crepeyness, & jowls. Even my husband has noticed!! I've NEVER used anything that has made any difference at all...until Strivectin. I'm a customer for life!"
"When people notice your face looking youthful and glowing and ask, what are you using-tell me !! I know I have the right PRODUCT!!! StriVectin Sculpting&Tightening Cream is the best I've tried yet!!!!! Not only me , people notice too. I LOVE IT!!!"
This product does exactly what it says. I love it and will continue to buy it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to achieve a more sculpted face.
"I've been using this cream for about a month, and can really see a difference in the texture and smoothness of my skin. I am almost 60 yrs old so my skin has loosened over the years...a bit of sagging. This cream seems to be doing what it claims, tightening and smoothing. Will continue to use the cream."
"Ok, so it's been several weeks. My first praise goes to the new whipped version! A lot goes a long way for me, so this light new texture is awesome! It's not as full bodied or thick as Strivetin's other creams, which is great because I can now use this in the morning instead of before bed (or both!). I feel so supple, yet volumized. My face thanks you! (I was actually considering injectable volumizers but am going to wait now)."
I really like how it absorbs quickly into my skin and makes it feel so soft and smooth. I also like how it tightens my skin...and my husband actually noticed the change in my complexion.
This is a great product that does what it claims. I have recommended to everyone who compliments my skin. Make sure to be consistent as with any product.
I have been using this face cream for about 2 weeks and have definitely noticed softened lines and tightness coming back. Not too heavy and face feels supple and nice. Loving it!
I normally use StriVectin SD Advanced Intensive Concentrate (for wrinkles and stretch marks) as a face cream; but I wanted to try a product specifically designed for the face. I was pretty disappointed With this product. It really doesn't moisturize. My face feels extremely dry and I've noticed flaking around my chin and nose. I have resorted to combing the above mentioned skin care product to help with dryness.
"I purchased this about a week ago, and I noticed the right side of my face actually had begun to show signs of sculpting! I just started using this product. However, I do see some great signs. I will continue to use it, and if it truly works, I will come back and finish the review! So far, I am very pleased."
"I received my products about a week ago and I am already happy with the changes in the look and texture of my skin. My skin looks and feels great. I feel that I look younger and when I look in the mirror, I like what I see. I am more than satisfied and I can't wait to see future differences."
Excelent! My skin changed until first week. I recommend it 100%. I am very happy with it.
I've only been using it a few weeks so it may be too early to notice a difference? So far nothing...
"I am very pleased with this and all the Strivectin products, the neck cream, eye creams, and lifting serum are all great as well"
Have been using for over a year and this product works beyond my expectations
"Unfortunately, I'm an old senior citizen and I don't really see a major difference. I keep trying your products and others hoping for that miracle reduce the wrinkles, but alas it probably won't happen at my age without plastic surgery, which I have not intention of doing. I think I'm just too old."
My first time trying this product I will make a recommendation based on how effective the product is for my skin.
"I have used this product for several weeks and am pleased with the results. It has a light, non-greasy feel."
I've been using the Tightening Cream for a couple of weeks. I'm seeing great results. I would recommend the cream to everyone.
Pleasantly satisfied with the Strivectin Skin Tightening & Sculpting Cream. My family has noticed a difference within a very short time if using.
I had run out for a short time and could see a change but fortunately reversed the loss when I began using the cream again
"This feels so good going on to the skin, very nourishing and luxurious but not too heavy. I've only been using it for a week but my skin looks more radiant and even. A coworker told me that my face looked slimmer and asked me if I was losing weight!"
The Tightening and sculpting face cream is lightweight and does not leave any residue. It absorbs quickly and tightens the problem areas- next to my mouth and between brows.
I bought this about a month ago and used it as directed. My skin became dry and creased at lips nose and cheeks. This is not for aging skin. I would like my money back but did not know how so am using it On my feet. Always loved Strivictin but no more
I use this Tightening and Sculpting cream under makeup and it moisturizes well but is light felling and not greasy. Just right!! Love the light texture so can use less but spreads over face well. Also very cost effective is bought in the set with the wonderful neck cream. At age 70 I like seeing less wrinkles and lifted skin. Will continue to buy this nice moisturizer.
Best of the best you will ever get from this product!
I brought this cream approximately 3 weeks ago and absolutely love it. I immediately noticed tightening and fullness around my mouth and cheek areas.
I used to buy this product and stopped. However now back w the product and still love it. I have sensitive skin and this product rocks.
I have used this before and like it because it helps with firming but does not cause the dreaded little white bumps. Use it with the other Strivectin firming products.
I've only been using this product for 3 days but they keep asking for a review. How can I review something without ample time to see if it works or not?
"I was going to return this Face Tightening and Sculpting cream because it smells like laundry left to long in the washer on a humid day! However, I have decided to try it and see how it works. If results are good I will try to endure the odor."
I have been using this product for 6 months now. My skin has never looked or felt better! The cream is light and goes on beautifully. Such a great item!
"I have been using this about 2 weeks , it might be to early to notice a difference . I can definitely say I love the way my skin feels when I put it on , SOFT , SILKY."
"I haven't had it too long, so the results aren't completely apparent just yet, but it feels good on my face and it's already seemed to have smoothed out some lines. I've used StriVectin products for many years, and they never disappoint."
"I cannot use the Strivectin neck tightening cream because it contains 1 ingredient that causes me to break out in hives. So I gave this a try for my neck and chest. Within 2 weeks the cracks and lines on my chest were barely visible and my neck feels tighter. I'm 45 and people think i'm in my early 30s when they meet me. Been using Strivectin SD on my face for years! I will definitely buy another jar of this tightening cream to go along with the SD, and am looking forward to trying the Strivectin serums!"
I love StriVectin products but Tightening & Sculpting Face Cream is one of the best! The biggest issue that I have are the indented lines at the corners of my mouth. I saw immediate results when I applied this product to my face and especially those specific areas around my mouth. The face has a smoother appearance and a healthy glow.9 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for about two weeks now, and I do like it. It is hard to say if there is much of a change, as I use mostly StriVectin products on my face and have always been happy with the results. Is this product better than the others? Frankly, I don't think so. It feels good and goes on the skin smoothly. But I haven't seen much difference in the tightening of my skin. Perhaps with continued use I will notice more of a difference. Stay tuned! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love love this product. Only been using a couple of weeks and can see a difference
"I purchased this about a month ago, and I already see an improvement in my skin texture and elasticity. Very pleased."
I have been using this cream for three years and changed a few months ago and it just didn't work as well. I'm back to this product.
I love the new light tightening they have made it perfect for under make-up! Not to mention it makes me look wonderful!
"Honestly, I see little or no difference. it seems to work a touch initially but that little bit of improvement only lasts an hour or so. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I apply the cream after using a Kiehl cucumber tonic. StriVectin's tightening face cream is the best one I've ever used, even similar ones by Chanel or YSL."
"I haven't used the product a month yet, and therefore gave it a 3 star. I haven't used it long enough to see the results stated. My skin does look better, but I don't see the tightening yet."
Almost done with my first jar and it definitely helps the lines. Very happy!
Bought three weeks ago and happy so far with the results.
you can see the difference as soon as you apply it to your face. my face just look prettier :):):)
This product really works. I could immediately see improvement.
I use this product everyday. It is light like. I love it!
Seems to be taking care of dry areas well. Doesn't clog pores
I have been using it a couple of weeks and love the way it feels on my skin .
Only have been using for a short time. No difference yet.
I have been using products for 3 weeks and already feel a difference in my skin tone.
I have used this product for a bit and though I find it very nice to go on your face my skin feels quite dry and tight a few minutes after applying if I do not put any other product on top of it. I would recommend it for sure but if you have dryer skin to definitely apply a moisturizer on to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used your Light Neck Cream and TL Advanced Tightening Neck Cream both are great products. Recently purchased your Tightening & Sculpting Face Cream ,and to my dismay I found product rather drying once it absorbed into my skin. Would not recommend this particular product for mature aging skin types."
"I tried this product for three weeks through a sampling program. I was already using Strivectin SD Advanced, so I switched for three weeks to this product. I did not notice any lines returning, so I was happy with the product. I think that some people might like this one better than the SD Advanced, because it seems to absorb with a little more matte finish. However, I think they are both good products, and that they both do a good job of reducing wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As soon as I began to use this product, I immediately saw the difference in not only how smooth my face looked and felt, but how bright it makes my skin look as well. At 61, I don't use any foundation and thought I would need to, to brighten my skin some, however, using this tightening cream allows me to not have to change my skin routine! Love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This did make my face look younger, fuller. I noticed my ""parentheses"" looked a little deeper and I believe that may have been because my cheeks were fuller. Other than that, I was very impressed. I will use a different cream on my cheeks near those deadly parentheses and see if that makes a difference because I did like what the product did for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After applying Tightening & Sculpting Face Cream I noticed after 2 days, my face was brighter, more youthful looking with great skin texture. I had started a skin care regiment, with better face washing, etc. I was excited to apply it day and night anticipating results. And I saw results immediately. This wears exceptional under my makeup, without adding to my oily skin condition. This has become my day and night regiment. SO EXCITED! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this product for one month, I have noticed how much this product truly tightens my face. Just bought more!"
I tried this and like the product right off. It does seem to reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles on the face and tome it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this but the last time I bought it (over a year ago) it smelled so bad, I had to stop using it. It smelled like sour laundry. Hopefully they have improved the scent by now because it worked great."
"This stuff is amazing! It has really lifted and contoured my face in all ways, I look so much younger!! I only use in the evening after the SV hydrate & replump serum, and it has really transformed my skin in just a few weeks!"
"I am so happy to find this product! I have used and loved TL Advanced Tightening Neck Cream for years and am so excited to have a similar product for my face. In a short time I could notice an improvement in the overall texture and smoothness of my facial skin. I am elated at the prospect of what continued use will do for me! Thanks, StriVectin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of Tightening & Sculpting Face Cream. I've been a fan of Strivectin products for a long time, but was never a fan of the smell. This cream is odorless! It feels very silky when you apply it. After a couple of days I noticed a plumpness and glow to my skin. That's when I started rationing my tiny sample! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use Strivectin Tightening serum so I didn't know what to expect from this new product. After using this product for several weeks I did notice a further reduction of the lines on the sides of my mouth! I like the product and will add this to my daily fight against aging signs and lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is an amazing product - it really delivers a firmer appearance and feel without being heavy or greasy. It absorbs quickly, and I can feel the firming qualities immediately. My skin feels springier to the touch now with no crepey look when I move it, a problem I had noticed before when applying skincare products. I feel like this has hydrated my skin down deep instead of just on the surface. Love it and will continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This skin tightening cream lives up to its claim of a great product. My skin did get tighter! I used this product before my 50th class reunion and was very pleased with the results. I would highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is my first time using this product from StriVectin. I like the results. I saw immediate firmer, tighter skin on my face. My face appeared sculpted and can feel the tighning effect thru out the day. The cream feels light and is not greasy. It would be even better if it had SPF 30, then I wouldn't have to apply that after putting this cream on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the product but it is to exspensive and I probably won't buy it again.
Something great to add to my routine. The lotion gives results with just a dab. Happy I tried it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've finally found a nourishing face cream that does everything it promises. I love the texture of this cream which absorbs quickly into my skin and does not leave a heavy or greasy feel. I am a customer for life! Thank you Strivectin!
Loved this for my lines around nose and mouth. Lines were less nociticable. Really like the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product many times. Love the way it absorbs into the skin. Helps my 69 year old skin look better [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is fantastic! Light and fresh. I only wish it had an SPF30 so I could use it under makeup outdoors. Is my after outside go to cream. Thanks for another great Product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this cream one time. I applied the cream before I went to bed. When I woke up in the am my face was swollen red/blotchy and burning. Two days later my skin is still red and peeling. I have never had any issues like this with any other creams. Terrible. Worst experience I have had with a face product; especially for the price.
"I received a free sample of this and when I finish it I plan to order more. It has a luxuriously thick texture and, when applied to your face, it seems to melt right in. I've noticed that my face appears to be smoother and more taut since I began using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Another great StriVectin product! It absorbs so quickly into the skin and leaves it slightly luminous as it minimizes lines and tightens the skin. I can't speak to the ""sculpting"" aspect as I am not sure what that really means... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this for about 3 weeks and I really like it. The biggest difference I notice from the other tightening products is that this absorbs really well which is great if you want or need to apply another Strivectin product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the tightening and sculpting face cream for about 4 weeks. My skin looks great and I'm sure people think I use fillers - which I don't. While I'm sure some of that is due to good genes, but there is no doubt that using Strivectin products has a lot to do with that as well. Give this stuff a try. It works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a wonderful product! There was a noticeable difference to my skin within just a few uses. Not only is my skin smoother and more consistent from in texture, but I look and feel years younger! I'm hooked! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really liked the other face cream that was part of this series, didn't think I'd notice much difference with this one. But on the skin, this face cream feels more like a moisturizer, and it leaves my skin feeling soft and hydrated. I also feel like my skin looks more lifted. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I already use StriVectin day and night. I tried this over my usual StriVectin day cream and it feels good on my face. There is a mild cooling affect. I am very happy with the products I use now and may add this to my StriVectin routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product just blew my mind, it melts on your fingers like butter. I absorbs quickly and it not greasy at all. Since I use StriVectin products and do not have a great need for this product, so I could not give it a five star rating, because I do not know how well it actually works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I joined the sampling club and received my first sample Tightening and Sculpting Face cream. I have been using Strivectin for years, but this new tightening and sculpting cream is amazing. LOVE IT!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the tightening and sculpting face cream for a few weeks now and I am not disappointed. The cream is not greasy and absorbs very well into the skin, leaving skin feeling soft and smooth. I wish it had a better smell though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Product is very lightweight, goes on so smoothly and does what is says. It ""blurs"" and softens the skin, making a great foundation layer before applying makeup. It firms up the skin and absorbs quickly without feeling a residue. Makes skin appear flawless and product works throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this cream three times now so I can only make short-term observations, but my main positive is that this cream is surprisingly lightweight for a firming cream. It seems thick at first, but after you rub it between your fingers a bit it becomes very smooth and glides on without being heavy. I will continue to use this as I really like the feel/texture & hopefully will be able to add a long-term review after some more uses. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used the Tightening and Sculpting Face Cream for only a couple of weeks and I love it. My face looks so much younger with it's smooth, sculpted appearance. I works wonderfully with my makeup products and still keeps it's ability to tighten my skin. I will continue to buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I could tell immediately after putting this cream on, the difference it makes. My face looked moisturized and wrinkles less noticeable. Even the deep wrinkle between my eyes practically disappeared after about a week of use. This cream is definitely gonna stay a part of my daily regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the product for four days, within that time l did notice some firmness in my skin. I think over a longer period of time l will achieve more significant results. I will continue using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have only been using my free sample for a little over a week now but the results are fantastic. My face is definitely tighter and the appearance of my wrinkles is much less when using. It only takes a small amount to cover my face so should last a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After just three days, I noticed an amazing difference in my skin. My face seemed both firmer and smoother; plumped up for more youthful contours. Wish it came in a tube, rather than a jar, but I'm definitely hooked on this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using the tightening cream on my face about a week ago and people can notice the difference. I have had a few compliments about how great my skin looked and this product makes my skin feel so soft I love it ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used the cream 2 times a day, and I found a minimal amount difference in my face. I wish the cream would have made my face a bit shinier. I found that when I used it, it just made it look dull. I did notice at the beginning my face did feel tighter, but then after multiple times of using it, I did not see a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Lightweight and unscented, Strivectin's new Tightening & Sculpting Face Cream absorbs readily into skin, leaving a smooth finish. Skin feels hydrated and after repeated use, fine lines are less noticeable. It's summertime and I feel confident enough to skip foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In the past two weeks that I have been using this Strivectin cream, I have noticed a remarkable difference ~ smoother, tighter and brighter skin. I sincerely recommend this product as a beauty staple! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use numerous Strivectin products and the tightening neck cream is always on hand! I like the consistency and feel of the light tightening neck cream and will definitely purchase when my sample runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Very excited to get to sample this product. I have already notice sagging in my cheek area and want to stop before I get the bulldog look. I feel like the product is beginning to work and with continued use will increase firmness in this area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Tried this cream on one side of my face when I walked pass a beauty counter, and saw the differences instantly. My friend had to remind me to put some up on my other side to balance my face out. Now this cream is a must for my daily skincare routine! :D"
I saw a noticeable difference in my jawline with this product. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this for a month now and no marked difference. Not very moisturizing at all. The repair & protect is better, leaves skin way more supple and young looking."

I thought I was getting a true product evaluation as I have in the past. This would allow me to use the product for several weeks and give a fair review. Instead I received a sample sized product. The cap was off so the product was completely dried up. I often get complemented on the condition of my skin and have recommended your products to anyone who asks. This will not be the case for this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of this product. Although it typically takes a month or two to see results, I did like the consistency of it, as other Strivectin products that I've used seem less ""silky, creamy"". [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
