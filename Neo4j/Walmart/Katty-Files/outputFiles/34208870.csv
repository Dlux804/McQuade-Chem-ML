I love this product. My face has softened and wrinkles less noticeable. I get complimented a lot on how great my skin looks at my age.
Have been using for a week I am amazed with this product. It has already tone out my skin and after losing 30 pounds my face and neck skin was starting to sag thos product has already started firming face and neck. The people that have said it peels off after drying may be using to much product. I use less than a dime size for both face and neck and had no problems. I also love the fresh smell and use it every night and wash my face in the morning before applying makeup.
"I have been using this overnight treatment for several months and noticed a clear improvement on my skin, in terms of smoothness and brightness. I wake up in the morning feeling my skin fresh. I also like the pleasant fragrance of this product"
"Love the fragrance for a light delicate fresh feeling. I even use this product on my neck too! I love how smoothly it goes on my face. I rub my hands together after, applying to my face! Great night mask! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free from topbox to try. I absolutely loved it. It left my skin so smooth and soft, and definitely noticed that my skin looked more ydrated, and the skin colour has evened out a bit. Looking forward to trying more from this line, as it is super affordable, and works amazingly fit its price range!"

I bought this for my mom and she loves it! She uses it every night and I've noticed such a beautiful glow in her skin.
i just started using that cream and i can tell already that my skin is nicer and smoother. it moisturizes well and my skin looks younger. it smells great too
"I've been trying this for a couple of days now and even from the first time I tried this, I instantly felt like my skin was smoother and hydrated! I will continue using this and seeing more results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the product for over a month and unfortunately it caused me to breakout badly - I am 58 years old. I ended up going back to another product (hypoallergenic free) and my breakouts cleared up within a week. I will say I have many Loreal products and overall work very well for me. This item unfortunately did not.
"Purchased a ""travel size"" that I found at CVS Drug stores, I'm so happy I decided to try it. On my 7th night, and it's fantastic! I am 54, African American, skin in pretty good shape, but starting to notice some loss of firmness, and larger pores. I exfoliate in the AM, maybe the combination of both, but pores definitely improved. Overall my skin looks brighter, and more radiant."
"I picked RevitalLift after reading an article on the best anti-wrinkle creams. I bought the product and in less than a week of use, I am completely amazed at the early results. Tighter pores, reduced lines and wrinkles, smoother/softer texture. I cannot wait to see the long-term results. And the price was very reasonable."
"This is a wonderful cream. Could tell a difference in my skin after the first 2 applications. It did wonders for my neck, too by reducing and firming the sagginess and fine wrinkles. This is my new ""must have"" face cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great cream. Unfortunately, I won't be buying it again. Although I love how my skin feels in the morning, it has too much perfume for a night cream. I can only apply it when I'm almost falling sleep otherwise I get a headache from smelling it for too long."
2 wks ive been using love face looks better is helping with brown spots did not no it would do that soft skin normally i dont like there products but this is. My favorite ive ever used better then Clinque hope it works for others the same im impressed
I received a Revitalift sample in the mail and I used it once and noticed a difference in my skin. This product balanced my skin tone and brightened my skin. My face felt soft and moisturized. I get very dry skin and it's difficult to find a product that works and this worked the first day. I also have sensitive skin and this product didn't irritate my skin at all. It is great and I will be buying more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So gentle and moisturizing and perfect for sensitive skin. I use it every other night and have actually noticed a difference in how I look when I wake up! My skin looks refreshed and with a nice glow. Its honestly become my go-to moisturizer. Its so hard to find a product that keeps moisturizing and produce some results - but this one does it. Trust me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used Olay Regenerist for years, but when traveling, I ran out and needed moisturizer. The store I went to was out of that, so I decided to try the Revitalift. It seems fine going on, though the cream is not really very creamy, but once it is all absorbed into my skin, there is a residue that comes off almost sand-like, but more moist. I have used it several days now, and each time I have to clean my face with a cloth because of the residue. I don't think I will be finishing this jar."
"Feels amazing as it's applied, but go to bed 10 minutes later or as long as it takes to dry. But once it's dry it may actually cake off because after all it isn't a mask. There's the bad, and for the good..."
My skin looks and feels amazing after regular use for almost 2 months. I'm 45 1/2 and have had a handful of people mistake me for 30-35 in the past couple of weeks.
"I'd give this 5 stars if it weren't for the perfumey/soap smell of the stuff. I don't like perfume on my face, and this stuff almost keeps me awake with the smell. Other than that it's an excellent exfoliant, the morning after my first use I could see it working. But please please take the fragrance out of it"
"I just recently bought this night moisturizer and thought the consistency was weird, like it has been sitting in the sun and got a tacky feel. Or it might have already been expired? I honestly couldn't stand the feel of it so I quickly washed it off. Sadly the next day I broke out where I used it. I liked the day cream of this but not the night, should have stuck with the day cream one."
I have used this for two weeks and I think my skin looks more refreshed when I wake up. A great winter skin product!
Highly recommend! I have tried many face creams and most do not come close to moisturizing my skin properly. I have sensitive skin and break out easily from lotion. I have no issues with this and use this as my day cream as well.
"I am always skeptical of the promises skincare products make, especially as it relates to African-American skin. I saw noticeably smoothier, youthful looking skin the first night I used this product. Thumbs up!"
I use the Overnight Mask during the day under my make up. I know that this isn't the recommended way but it works for me. I'm 68 and people think I'm in my 40's or 50's so it must be my skin plumpness and dewiness.
My wrinkles on my forehead are less pronounced and I just used it for week. It goes on smooth and has helped to tone my jawline. This product is amazing!
"Sleeping masks are all the rage these days, and this one stands up tp the rave reviews! After the first night, I could see a difference in the firmness of my skin! Loved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got a 14 day revitalift and I wished I had more it felt great to use this product it moistures around my eyes forehead and around mouth thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was between 3 and 4 stars for this. The product works well but it has a gel-like texture that I didn't like. I find cr√®me easier and more pleasant to apply
"I was very doubtful it would help my aging sun damaged skin, but I was wrong. My skin is smooth, no more roughness! Loved it! Went out and bought it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love feel of this mask, however the scent/perfumr was overwhelming and I can only force myself to use a couple times a week. If I only use in forehead I am okay, but I need it around my mouth and chin are and can't handle the smell."
The results of this overnight mask after just a few uses is impressive. My skin is feeling smoother and more hydrated and my complexion is evening out. Great stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I hate the terrible smell of this product. It works great on my skin, but has such a herrific scent, I can't use it. It leaves my pillow smelling- can't stand it."
"I've been using this product every night for 2 years now, and even my esthetician asked me what kind of product I use because she goes my skin looks great! My face is very moisturized and the dark sun damaged cheek area seems bit lighter than before."
This is my second purchase. I really love this stuff and my face does too!
"I really love the feel of this Intensive Overnight Mask. I do wish that you had FRAGRANCE FREE versions of your day and night creams! We do not need the extra chemicals! Fragrance is just plain bad for the skin and breaks down the collagen! I would have given it 5 stars if it didn't have perfume in it! I do not have sensitive skin, but a lot of us do and No one needs to put perfume on there facial skin!"
"Tried after I got some samples, best product I ever used!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this item, it is really working . Have used it on my hands, arms, and face. I can really see the difference on my hands."
"More hydrating than most overnight masks I've tried, but not hydrating enough on its own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this product. Great price. Arrived quickly and well packed. Makes skin feel smooth and not at all greasy.
"I've been using this and the double lift eye creams. Definitely see a difference, which is refreshing. Most creams really don't deliver. I'll be sticking with these."
I have used this night cream for quite a while now. It is a great overnight moisturizer. I love how smooth my skin is in the morning and it has improved my complexion tremendously! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"One night and I'm in love. I'm a side sleeper and usually in the morning I wake up with weird creases and puffiness. This morning no creases, skin was smoother and those pesky under eye bags were almost invisible."
I was given a 2 weeks sample to try for review. Personally I did not see a difference in the reduction of my fine loves. I do like the ways it smells and how hydrating and smooth it made my face feel however I did not like the fact that in less than 10mins after applying it wants to peel off my faces in piles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used for the first time this week...I am extremely happy with the quick results. I have forehead lines and deep lines between my eyes and they already look greatly reduced. it is a heavier cream so a little goes a long way...but not tight feeling and very creamy, Definitely a winner!"
"As a 37 year old woman with super dry skin, this mask is a lifesaver. It smells amazing, which makes me want to apply every night!, and feels super hydrating when applied. I wouldn't say I saw a difference overnight but definitely within two weeks. My skin feels plumper and healthier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It works overnight his magic and my skin look refreshed in the morning.
"I recently started using this and it's very moisturizing and rich. However, the smell is so offensive, I'm not sure that I can keep using it!"
"I really like this overnight mask. The price has slightly increased since I bought it last week. It was $17.33, now 19.97. The price is quite reasonable on Walmart, despite the recent rise."
"I love this product! I have used it every night for a month so far and there's still some left in the jar. It feels great on my skin and it smells good, too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think you should add a subtle fruit scent and call it Facial Preserves!. .that is the consistency it seems to have. .it feels thick and luscious! So creamy when I put it on. . .and wouldn't that be a great play on words?
I AM USING THE TRIPLE POWER INTENSIVE OVERNIGHT MASK NOW FOR OVER A WEEK AND MY FACE LOOKS SO MUCH HEALTHIER. MY SKIN IS BRIGHTER AND THE CONTOURS OF MY FACE ARE FULLER
"I love it, works majic! I have bad skin due to acne and acne scars and this thing is fading it away. Made my skin a lot brighter and repaired my uneven skintone! It definitely helps fade wrinkles!"
"i really hoped this product would at least patially live up to it's claim. been using it for weeks and don't see the slightest difference. my sunken spots are still sunk, and not even a tiny difference in small wrinkles. i will finish the jar, because it wasn't cheap, but will not buy it again. another product that promises but doesn't deliver."
I use it for day. It's the best for under makeup. Very smooth and stays moist with no shine. I like the price on Walmart also. By the way. Walmart free shipping over 35 dollars. Save your beauty essentials shopping for once a month and get it at your door. I dont work for Walmart by the way. I work for Mercedes Benz but love saving money and convenience!
This mask is very good if you have dry skin. I have not used it long enough ( used for about a week ) to see any anti-aging effects yet. The price is good enough to give it a try though. It's great for the season change when your skin gets a little dry.
This stuff is pretty awesome! I am just getting to the point where my skin seems to be aging and I am very self conscious about wrinkles and my skin not being as tight as it used to. This is really helping! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Having reached my mid-sixties and have someone ask me what I use on my face, because my skin looked so smooth, made my day. I told her I use Triple Power. Just last Saturday, I saw a woman looking over the options in face creams and I pointed out Triple Power. She said ""but you don't have wrinkles"" and I said ""oh, you left your glasses at home"". Anyway she put Triple Power in her cart."
The BEST product AWESOME makes my skin feel soft lines disappeared over a few weeks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just purchased this product several days ago. I was amazed because my skin looked better after the first night's use. I intend to use this every night because it actually does what it promises.
this product is excellent
Love it see the differences my pore and neck were sague no more
"noticed difference within several weeks, skin appeared firmer and younger"
"Love this product. Doesn't irritate my sensitive skin and has helped with some blemishes. Don't know if wrinkles are diminished, though."
"This stuff is weird, plus I did not notice a different in one night. I will not buy this item again, too much money & it doesn't feel like a moisturizer, it's like putty in a jar I will use it till it is gone - but not purchase it again"
Good product. Does help soften the skin. Has a strong smell but ok.
Helps with my dry skin.
I tried this. It smells like nair. The smell wakes me up. Yuk.
