"I bought this cream about 4 month ago, my skin has never looked better. Everyone tells me ""you look so great"". I just love the cream and hope it will always be available"
Love this moisturizer and the scent is so clean and fresh. I'm very happy with this purchase and will keep using it nightly.
"This product makes my skin appear and feel that it is holding more moisture. Too, my skin appears to have a vibrant glow when I use this moisturizer. That alone contributes to the more youthful appearance of my skin. I don't stop with my face. I use it on my neck, upper chest and back of my hands. All these areas give away my age and the Triple Age moisturizer aids in keeping these areas plump in appearance."
The Triple Age Repair Night Moisturizer is excellent for the over 50 aged skin who has had lots of sun damage. I am impressed with its ability to soften and renew my skin and reduce wrinkles and fine lines. Good stuff.
"Just started using this product. Neutrogena never disappoints. Needed a deep moisturiser! Makes my skin soft, not itchy and dry. No strong smell to it either. Smooths on and soaks in your skin."
"I tried so many different products that I believe it was too strong. Irritated my skin and made look worse, with acne, red skin...."
This cream is light and no irritation at all.
"I am 87 years old, and have always taken good care of my skin. As I've aged it has become more of a challenge. This product really works, and I am so pleased with the results."
I started using this product the moment I noticed crows feet n smile lines at the young age of 35. I'm 38 now n I must say this product had helped my skin look n feel younger. My tone is more even my pores are smaller n my lines are almost non existent. I adore this product!!
I already used the Triple Age Repair Night time moisturizer & like that.
Decided to purchase the day time moisturizer & glad I did.
"Smells great and, though I still have wrinkles, it makes my skin feel better."
Finally found a product that works for me - have definately seen an improvement
in my skins appearance!
My Dermatologist recommends these products. I love the results. My skin is so soft and and I have received compliments on my face.
"My skin is soft and moisturized. I'm a little disappointed since deeper wrinkles haven't disappeared; I may have waited too long to start . Having said that, I don't see new ones beginning either."
"I do not understand all the poor reviews on this night cream,if used every night after about 6weeks the difference in my skin was obvious. More even toned,my skin looks refreshed,and redness was relieved dramatically.i do use this in the colder months mixed with my oils,or just layer my oils on top of this..it's a great night cream if used consistently and works well with other products"
Not greasy and absorbs very quickly. I use it twice a day to keep skin hydrated.
I buy it regularly and use it morning and night!!!!
"I brought my products a month ago, I am so happy the way my skin looks and feels!!!"
I havent seen any visible signs yet and I have been usong them both for over a week now.
The pretty purple jar caught my eye initially. Then....what a surprise to find a fabulous smelling light non greasy night cream that leaves my skin perfect!!! Love the smell so much I put it on my hands too! It has become my favorite night cream of my 10 or so I have!! Never discontinue this perfect skin in a jar!! I'm over 60 with oily sensitive skin. I adore this product
"I have been using Triple Age Repair daytime moisturizer nearly two years and still think that it is diminishing my wrinkles. It doesn't cause me to break out, doesn't feel too sticky. I've tried a couple other moisturizers suggested to me by friends and I keep returning to my Triple Threat! I love this and hope Neutrogena will continue to make it for years to come, or else develop something equally good that 65-year-old me will be able to use in 10 years. Absolutely recommend this product!"
"I just received it, so far love it. Bought 2 cannot wait to see a difference. Thank you for the great value."
"Woke up this morning after first use last night and met all my expectations. I will update review after a few more uses after reading some of these reviews. Loving scent, consistency, and my skin feels so soft. We'll see!"
"I'm a loyal Neutorgena user of other products and after 3 nights of this my cheeks are red, hot, and rough. Thankfully other reviewers shared the same bad experience so I knew it wasn't just me. Neutrogena, this should have a label warning!"
I can't say if is great are bad I just been trying the product less then a week but it smell good and my face is so smooth and I know it will give great results once given time
Goes on quickly. My skin looks and feels better after just 1 week of nightly use. Unscented and non-irritating to my sensitive skin. I'm allergic to almost all the skincare products out there. Neutrogena has always been a brand I trust for my skin.
"I am a 60+ year old man working in a profession that seems to value youth over wisdom. I have been using this product and the Rapid Wrinkle Repair, twice a day, for about a year and am frequently guessed as being considerably younger. And, the price is great. (Watch out kids.)"
"I have sensitive skin! I bought this in Jan 2019, and ready for a second jar. People asked me what I use for my face. I have it in my purse all the time because I love the fact it is spf 25."
"...but I am not so regular about moisturizing at night. I do LOVE the day moisturizer, which I think it really has softened my wrinkles (I'm 55.) I think this night moisturizer is probably worth a try (and probably worth me being more serious about it!)"
I bought this 4 weeks ago saw a little bit difference on my skinbyt it's good and I will definitely recommend this cream
I'm turning 67 right at Christmas time. This is the nicest product I've used that works as well as it does. It's super jazzy on my face!!!
"I was sent a full size sample in the mail. In just 4 weeks I can tell a big difference in the way my skin feel. Soft, silky and smooth. I really recommend this product to everyone. It great."
Takes a few days but starting to see a difference. Skin is smoother. Takes just a little patience - not a miracle but best I've used so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product!! I use both this and the one with SPF. They are fantastic!!! My skin looks great - I get compliments (and I still get carded though easily 10++ yrs past carding age). I've used a number of product and this is the best
"I have been using Neutrogena Triple Age Repair at bedtime, this is my second week. I am very happy with the smoothness of the cream and Triple Age Repair has my face looking younger with a radiance all its own. I haven""t had any problems with tightness or itchiness !Works on all my facial problems ! I won""t use any other night cream in the future . Neutrogena you have a happy and for life consumer."
"After using this Triple Age Repair SPF 25 Moisturizer. My face and neck starting itching (I put it on my neck as well). And like the other reviewers mentioned, little bumps started to appear and my skin got red and felt very irritated. I took me a while to realize that it could be this product that was causing it. I stop using it. And gradually the itching, bumps, and irritation began to subside. It took at least 4-6 days before the terrible side effects of this Neutrogena went away."
"Because of the reviews, I started out slowly, applying a small amount of moisturizer on my damp 71 year old skin and then slightly increased the amount over time. My dry skin is now soft, the fine lines and unevenness of my skin tone have diminished. Thank you, Neutrogena, for putting everything, including SPF, that I need in one product line. I love it and am buying more, please keep this line!"
"I have tried countless night creams and all they did was grease up my face. I have been using Triple age repair night moisturizer since July and I can't believe the difference in my skin. The tiny lines around my mouth are actually gone. I took a close look in the mirror and couldn't believe my eyes. Neutrogenea, I am your new biggest fan! Thanks ~ Michele"
"After using this product twice, the skin on my face and neck feels tight and itchy like a sunburn. The texture of my skin has gone from smooth to having fine bumps and feels very rough. I have used other Neutrogena products for many years with no issues, but will not continue using this product."
"I have been using this beautiful product for about a week and my skin has a clarity that I haven't seen before! not only does it sink in nicely, I don't become oily which is amazing considering I have oily skin. It is absolutely stunning under makeup and (btw, I am using much less makeup) My skin has not been sensitive to this product at all like many of the other reviewers. I now need to get the PM cream to go with this day cream. i am in awe! I have been using la mer and all the expensive stuff with less results."
"I used the night moisturizer and after two nights I woke ups with puffy, red, bumpy cheeks and chin. My face was warm to the touch and swollen. I don't normally have reactions to products but this reaction was quick and is itchy and painful. I will be returning this product. I would not reccomend."
"I have combination and sensitive skin....I was more concerned about the wrinkling on my neck from sun damage. I have never used Neutrogena products before....I was looking for a cream containing Vitamin C....Well, so far, so good! I am impressed with the initial results, even though it has only been 2 days....Onward and upward!"
"Because of the reviews, I started out slowly, applying a small amount of moisturizer on my damp 71 year old skin and then slightly increased the amount over time. My dry skin is now soft, the fine lines and unevenness of my skin tone have diminished. Thank you, Neutrogena, for putting everything I need in one product line. It works for me!"
"I've always loved your products and just found this one. Have only used for 1 week but in love with it more each day. I have dry skin and it moisturizes great. Makeup goes on extremely well and as I said before, my skin looks like it is glowing from within. Thank you."
I am just finishing my first bottle and on line to purchase a second. I really like how the cream feels on my face and all the fine lines have disapearred .
I am 73 and have used various Neutrogena products for the past twenty five years and have almost no lines or wrinkles. Dermatoligist told me to use their products and I'm glad I followed his advise.
"My face has freckles and blemishes but under control now with the help of this product. All my facial regimens are consist of this brand, helps me with my uneven tone ant deep wrinckles. It makes my skin well nourished, it blends well with my daily make up. Most ot my patients thought that I am still in my late twenties and or early thirties but infact, I am almost 45y/o. Thank you Nuetrogena!"
"I absolutely love Neutrogena products. I could be a spokesperson for your company. I highly recommend Neutrogena to anyone. I especially love the Rain bath body cleanser, high quality makeup and facial products. Thank you for being true and honest Neutrogena :0)"
"i have used so many skin moisturizing products over the years and Triple Age Repair Day and Night Moisturizers. are by far the very best. I am so happy with the way my skin has responded to both products. My skin glows, and looks alive. I am receiving compliments on how beautiful my skin looks. Thank you, Neutrogena!"
I used to use I like Neutrogena Visibly Firm Lift Active Copper. Great product! but just discontinued. so disappointed because it could firm and lift my skin. This product just not as good. wish it could have Firm Lift Active Copper ingredients and results. Please bring Visibly Firm Lift Active Copper back!!
"I'm late 50s and looking for affordable products to reasonably preserve my skin quality. I've been trying different ones. I like this and feel it has had a positive effect on my appearance. To me it's not greasy, and the fragrance not at all offensive. I like the way my skin looks and feels for an OTC product.."
"I have beyond sensitive skin this is the only cream I can use without a rash or itching, believe me I have tried many creams in my life. Even my legs have problems with lotion, I was very surprised to hear about the reaction because no one has more sensitive skin than I."
"I was so surprised to notice that lines around my eyes and mouth were almost invisible after only 5 days. I really had not taken the time to look closely before that, because I was not expecting to see any changes so soon. The product is light and creamy and just seems to melt into my skin. It is not greasy. I definitely recommend this moisturizer for mature skin."
Triple Age Repair burned my face and neck. The redness persisted for two weeks. This product is dangerous and should not be on the market. I use other Neutrogena products and I have for many years with no problems. There seems to be too many others that have had similar experiences. Be warned!
Always use Neutrogena products but the 2nd night of using this night cream My face is swollen my eye are very puffy my face is red its like sunburn. I will not use this again. Please check this product..... I have had to take a Piriton to help the swelling..
I have been using this cream for 4 to 5 months. I don't see any significant difference in my skin although I will say it does keep it moisturized. I think this is an adequate cream for the price. The one thing I really do not like is the fragrance. It is too overpowering. A face cream should not smell like a perfume.
"I have used Neutrogena products for years and I absolutely love the sunscreen. But for some reason my skin did not react well to this. I have little bumps all over my cheeks and chin, and I have had two really bad breakouts (my skin is usually pretty clear). I am going to stop using this immediately."
"My Sister who can't use Clinique used this with great results. We both work up the next day after using this on cleaned skin the night before and the results were more than we expected. Skin was plump and smooth, and refreshed. We are not going to see 50 again and this product works. Thank you!"
"I've used many moisturizers with Vitamin C, retinol, and other anti-aging ingredients, and have never been sensitive to those products. I used this last night for the first time, and woke up to swelling, redness, and itchiness that is everywhere I put the cream, including my neck. I generally like, & frequently buy, Neutrogena products, and I never bother to write reviews, but I look like I've been burned and my skin is rough around my jawline still 24 hrs later."
"I appear to not be the first one to report a strong allergic reaction to this product. I, too, found that my daily night moisturizer had been discontinued. So I chose this cream. Big mistake. I woke up with itchy, inflamed, red skin, especially on my neck. It proceeded for days, then peeled. I'm sorely disappointed and will attempt to return it at the store."
"This product is more expensive and not nearly as good as the Intensive Day Moisturizer SPF 15 which Neutrogena took off the market. It has a slightly unpleasant odor which fortunately dissipates quickly. Hydration is okay but not great. What I really dislike about it is that it takes quite a while to absorb and then will peel and flake off if you touch it. It's okay in a pinch, but there has to be something a lot better out there."
"First time trying this product and it works great! I've used many other skin moisturizers with varied results but this one is a keeper. It has a nice clean scent, goes on easy and the best part it absorbs right into your skin! After you apply the the moisturizer your skin looks amazing and feels so soft! Glad I tried it and hope this helps those looking for a great moisturizer."
Ordered this and the day cream.I love both. Without being greasy it nourishes my skin and makes it much softer to the touch. I have dry sensitive wrinkled prone skin. Oils and cleansing cream were just too heavy. This is perfect for my skin. Will write a separate review of the day cream . Also be buying other products from you. Thank you!
"I used this product once as directed. The next day my face and neck were bumpy, red, itchy, slightly swollen, and burned. It is now two days post using it and my face is still very irritated. I have never reacted this way to any face creams especially one from Neutrogena so I don't know what's in this one that has caused this. I will be returning this product and NEVER recommending this cream to anyone!"
"I used the night cream and it cause my eyes, face and neck to swell. My skin burns and itches and it cause tiny welts all over my face. I only used it one night and it has been two days and my skin is still bumpy, itchy and burning. And my face continues to be swelled up. This may work for other people but not for me."
I have tried numerous anti aging skincare regimes with no luck. I've been searching for a night cream that wouldn't be too heavy and oily on my skin. I found that and so much more in this product! It's been all of 3 nights of using and my fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes and mouth are diminishing! I'm 43 years old and I am told I look 35! So very happy with this product!
"I absolutely love Neutrogena products and bought this night cream the first time I saw it in the store last week. After one use I noticed improvement in my skin the next morning, tighter skin and a rosy glow. It has a light, pleasant smell that my husband likes. It's not greasy and makes my skin feel soft and perfectly moisturized. Perfect in this cold, dry winter climate. I liked it so much I just bought the day cream and look forward to using it."
I usually do not have sensitive skin and my skin reacted horribly to this product. My eyes and face are swollen and my skin is burning. I think I need to visit my dermatologist. Based on some of the other reviews I am reading there has to be something in this product that is causing this reaction. Very disappointed and would not recommend this product.
"I love this product, I can actually feel it working on my cleaned skin with it's light tingling effect. I love the light scent too. This product does not bother my skin all. Please don't change it. Every one has different skin types and opinions, if it doesn't work for you, move on. It doesnt mean its not a good product. It has reduced wrinkles and age spot in a very short time. Works great! Thanks!"
"I used this product for the first time last night and I woke up this morning and my face was swollen and red. Right now it feels as if it is on fire. Unfortunately, this product contains fragrance and my skin has a reaction to most products with fragrance. I was attempting to save money by buying this cream as opposed to Olay's, which is fragrance-free but more expensive. I guess I'll have to stick with what works..."
"I used this product for the first time on Monday. I woke up with a terrible red rash and burning sensation. I do not have sensitive skin and have been using the full line of Neutrogena products with success. Please take this product off of the market, looking at all of the reviews and outcomes, there is clearly something wrong with this product. I will be taking it back to CVS for a full refund and contacting my dermatologist."
"Used this product 2xs. Second time I woke up with my face feeling like it was burning. I have red welts on my face, my eyelids are swollen and my face hurts. I will not be using this product anymore, but have used lots of their other products with no issues."
"After using a full jar of this cream I can honestly say my skin feels softer, my tone is more even, and seems to help with fine lines. The scent is not overwhelming to me, in fact, it's kind of a nice aroma therapy before sleep. Some people complain of dry skin after using product. For me it's a plus. I have VERY oily skin and when I wake up after having used this product, there is barely any oil on my face. I love it! Maybe it should be advertised for women with oily skin?"
"Be very careful with this product. I used it only twice and it left my face red, rough, and swollen right now. I used Neutrogena sunscreen all the time with no issue. I haven't had any problems with other moisturizers. This is the very first time with severe reaction. It might work for you skin type. But as said, I never had skin reaction with other moisturizers."
"I bought this product a week ago and started using it. Immediately I noticed some stinging when applying, then some redness afterwards. I thought maybe it was another product I had used so decided to use this product on it's own another night and I had the same reaction. A lot of stinging initially that subsides, and then some redness following it. The morning after I noticed my skin was drier and itchy."
"I'm 44 years old, and have never had a facial product cause an allergic reaction. Well, now I have... the Triple Age Repair Night Moisturizer (after just ONE night of use)... caused red, hot rash allover my neck + face where I used it. That was 2 nights ago, and I'm still red + itchy, with nothing bringing me relief. I neglected to read the reviews before I bought/used this product, big mistake. I've generally been pleased with Neutrogena products in the past, but please listen to your customers on this one."
"I was looking forward to a skin moisturize to help with fine lines. I was very disappointed when after four uses I starting experiencing a chemical reaction. My face broke out with painful blisters. I have been treating the damages of this cream for 10 days now. I am hopeful there won't be scarring, however some blisters were much worse that others."
I've been using Neutrogena for many years. Purchased the Triple Age Repair Moisturizer three weeks ago. This product is amazing. I'm 64 and my skin hasn't looked this good since my twenties. Wish I could take a bath in it to help the rest of me look this good! Lol
Saw this lovely jar with nice scent so immediately bought it to try. Goes on non greasy very light yet creamy lovely texture. As far as ingredients for actually improving skin there are no peptides ceramides collagen elastin Vit A or E and never about Hexinol. A dab of glycolic acid in it as well would help. I'm over 50 but look younger. No need to add SPF TO creams if you wear a 50 sunblock over In the day. Pls keep nice scents like this in your products and more elegant packaging like this cream!
"I bought this cream because I use Neutrogena cleanser and daytime moisturizer that I have used for years and love. I was excited to try the Triple Age Repair Night Moisturizer. After night 1, my face felt great. After night 2, I felt a little burn when I cleansed my face. After night 3, my face is swollen, red, and has dry flaky patches and bumps! My face is so painful! I've never had a reaction like this, especially with a Neutogena product!"
"After 2 days of use, my face was covered in tiny red bumps. The next morning I woke to a red swollen face as well as extreme burning and itching. I have never had any type of allergic reaction to face products and I have used other Neutrogena products for years with no issues. Heed my warnings, I feel & look terrible. Do not recommend!"
I bought these products last weekend triple age repair and eye cream. The triple age cream is starting to burn my face and leave red spots. And the eye cream doesn't work. I use the triple age cream every night and the eye cream every morning and night. I'm so disappointed. I'm returning these products ASAP.
i started using this product for sometimes now it work perfectly for my skin
Bought this product three months ago on second container.
I have been using this product for over 3 years and have been happy with it.
"This product is extremely emollient, but non-greasy providing great moisture."
Can't tell that it is working yet.skin just feels softer.
I like the heavier cream for night. Absorbs quickly and feels smooth [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am very pleased with this product. It's working out very well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Triple Age Repair is the first thing I use before settling back for the evening. Other nighttime preps follow.
First use and my skin was puffy and red. I will be returning to place I bought. I am 50 years old and am really surprised at the reaction this had on my skin.
"I've used this 3 times, and it has caused a burning sensation on my cheekbone area. Is this suppose to happen? Cheeks are feeling warm to the touch in the mornings now, almost a raw feeling."
"the skin became so dull, it acts like a peel right 5 minutes after I apply the cream on my face... so obviously must be left alone and without makeup... I don't use many cosmetics, but if I don't have a basic makeup on, I am not myself."
I love neutrogena products and was excited to try this new one. After the second night I woke up to a hive on my neck and a rash all over my face. My skin is tight and burning. I do not have sensitive skin so this is a surprise.
"I wanted to love this like the other Neutrogina products I use. But after 2nd day of use, my face had mild rash and burning/itching sensation. Two days later it still hurts! Will not try again!"
Meets the high expectations for my aging skin. Have had a lifetime of experience with skin creams and finally have the one the works best for me. I love this product!
"I have used this product one time and that was last night, I woke up to red and blotchy cheeks that burn. This was a waste of my money and I am very disappointed."
"I, too, have problems with products that can aggravate acne breakouts, even at my age! This formula is extremely light, smells great (makes you want to apply), and feels comfortable for a long while. Please do not discontinue..."
"i have used Neutragena products, particularly face lotion for over 27 years without problem, but the second time I used this product I woke up with severe red rash and puffed up eyes."
I love this night moisturizer. I instantly felt the softness of my skin after 3 nights. I hope they don't ran out of this because I am stocking for more!
"After having 2 little girls and turning 30, i realized that my skin needed help with acne, wrinkles and dark spots. This helps out sooooo much and it doesnt make me break out. Very satisfied customer. It is a little costly but its worth it."
I bought this without reading any of the reviews. My bad. After two nights I noticed red patches on my forehead and tiny red bumps all over my face and neck. I'm so disappointed. Only positive comment is that it does have a pleasant scent.
I am sorry about the bad ratings of this product - I am on my second jar and love it. My skin feels smoother. I normally have very sensitive skin but no reaction to this.
I've been using Triple age repair for 3 months. I have redness on my cheeks & starting to get wrinkles around my the bottom of my eyes & have large pores on my nose.I have seen no difference at all. What a big let down for a high end product.
"I used this for two nights and my face broke out in a terrible rash. It felt hot, was swollen, scaley with a rash. Four days later it still hurts and has small blisters all over it. I have never had a reaction to a moisturizer before."
"My usual night moisturiser ran out so I bought this one and after only one use I woke up the following morning and my face was bright red. It felt wind burnt, swollen and tight. Just awful. Never to be used again."
I used this for the first time tonight. So far I love the way my skin feels. The skin under my eyes seems smoother. Very happy with the product so far.
For some reason this cream does not blend well on my face - leaves my face looking like it is peeling! I have used several other Neutrogena products and have never had this problem. Any ideas why?
I've been using this as a sunscreen and moisturizer. It has worked well for me. I love the price for your products but I'm wondering if you have anything like this that contains antioxidants and lipids?
I have used Neurotgena products for years. I have been using this product and my face is breaking out. I'm upset because I spent a lot of money for this to happen.
The women in our family have been using Neutrogena products for years. I am seeing a slow but nice improvement in skin. Thank you neutrogena for taking care of the women in our family for years with your wonderful products.
"I used it for two nights and my face is red and raw. I stopped using it yesterday and I continue to get red, puffy and raw. It is very painful like an acid on my skin and I don't have sensitive skin. Dry, peeling and painful."
I've used this product for about one week. It caused a slight burning sensation when applied and has since created dry patches around my eyes forehead and upper lip. In the morning my eyes looked like they were swollen.
My skin feels silky and soft. My skin looks very glowing and hydrated I usually don't like other Products Bit my mom let me use it. Best thing I've used in a long time never felt so good about my skin
I have been using this product for about a week and it made my skin better after the first day. My skin is nice and soft and smooth looking. No irritation at all. Love it.
"I have been using this product for 2 weeks and love it. I have better skin tone using it. Love the smell and smoothness of my skin. Not sure about wrinkles because I don't think I have used it long enough, but so far I am loving it."
I did not like at all the first day of use my skin was swollen and red I had a very bad reaction I still have red spots on my face and it made me very dry
i HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY MONTHS AND AM VERY PLEASED. IT REDUCES SOME OF THE FINE WRINKLES AND SOME OF THE DARK SPOTS WHILE LEAVING MY SKIN SOFT. IT ALSO SEEMS TO HELP WITH SOME OF THE LITTLE ODD SKIN IMPERFECTIONS THAT POP UP ON MY FACE FROM TIME TO TIME. I DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!
"I've been using nothing else at night on my aging skin for several months now and very happy with the results. Noticed a real difference the first week. A clean scent, refreshing, and non-greasy. Never had any bad effects like some unlucky reviewers (sensitive to the Vitamin C?). Not good for taking eye make-up off though...will sting eyes a bit (I use Neutrogena Naturals Multi-Vitamin Moisturizer for that). Love this stuff!"
"Just tried this as I was looking for a moisturizer with sunscreen. Within hours a red flush had appeared and today (3days later) after not using it since the one time, my face is still splotchy, itchy, and puffy. I knew I couldn't use retinol but I checked the box first and did not see it listed. Apparently I can't use hexinol either. Just an FYI for those allergic to retinol as you may have the same reaction."
Great value [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
smells good and seems to help with the wrinkles.
I have used this product twice and I woke up with a swollen itchy face that looks like a reaction to something in it. It's the only thing I have done different in the last 2 days and the rash is only on my face where I used the product. I love Neutrogena products and have used the Daily lotion for years. I switched to this for something heavier in the cold weather.
"Just applied for first time. Has a floral perfume scent. Which may be good if you like florals, but i don't. With promoting Vitamin C, I expected something more citrus smelling which seems to be the trend. My eyes seem to be drying out, but not a deal breaker. No burning. But honestly I don't think I can deal with the scent. So back to the drawing board for a night treatment. I am 50 year old and wear make up all day- seeking anti aging nourishment and wrinkle cream."
"I am using this produce, as well as the daytime moisturizer. I also use the exfoliating cleanser, and pore refining toner. These all worked exceptionally for the first two weeks or so. Now my skin is crazy dry, and tight. We've used Neutrogena products for years and I want to continue using them. I hope the company sees this and reaches out so I can figure out what's happening. In the meantime, I will add the moisture boost gel to my regimen, slacking off on some of the others, and see if this helps repair the problem."
"I bought this product about 2 weeks ago, and I can begin to see a difference in my overall eye appearance. My circles looks lighter but as for the fine lines, there is no difference. Which I never thought there would be, honestly. If the dark circles gets any lighter I will come back and write another review."
"I woke up with swollen eye lids and super tight, dry skin. My eyelids are still swollen. I have used other Neut. products, like the deep moisture night cream, and have not had reactions. Does anyone know what ingredient that causes this? I see others have had this problem."
OMG I love this product. My skin look so much younger. Please please don't take this product away. I will keep buying it. Thanks
BURN MY SKIN AND HORRIBLE ALLERGIC REACTION to this product. I didn't listen to reviews and now I am regreting it. never again...
"I have found this moisturizer very rich and it soothes my dry skin instantly and lasts a long time. I do wonder, though, if it is non-comedogenic?"
"I love Neutrogena and have used it for years. Unfortunately, within a few hours of the first usage, my cheeks are on fire!!"
"I don't have lines around my eyes and face, this product is the best. I highly recommend this cream.People think I am 35 but I am 48."
This night repair moisturizer really does make my skin feel refreshed after I have removed make-up and washed it.
This cream is so easy and smooth to apply. I use it on my face and neck and I feel completely protected all day.
This is my favorite night cream as well as a skin boost during the day. It really is a great product.
"I had allergic reaction, my eyes pocket swollen, red rash all over face."
Be careful in using this.
I needed a night cream and purchased this one because I like Neutrogena products. I notice a difference when I use cream in the winter.
"After 2 nights use, both on face and neck, i awoke with ""hot"" feel to entire face and neck area, reddened ""rashy"" look, and terrible itching. After not using for past 3 days, still have remnants of redness and itching. Won't use again."
"I am not certain the product is performing as advertising (i.e., reducing the appearance of wrinkles), but I also fear what I'd look like if I didn't use the product. I like the ease of use and how it feels on my face. It's not heavy or greasy."
"I bought this in place of my usual night cream which the store was out of. After two nights of using this I awoke, on New Year's Day nonetheless, with an extremely warm and swollen face! This product should not be on the shelves if it can cause such an allergic reaction. My eyelids are so swollen I can barely see out of my eyes. Kind of surprised with Neutrogena saying they are ""#1 dermatologist recommended."" Please remove this product from the shelf."
"I used this product for two days and it has ruined my skin. It's burned swollen pealing & itchy! I am terrified that it will never be the same. I used this product on Sunday & Monday, woke up Tuesday and my face was completely swollen and burning! I had to take off work on Wednesday because it was unbareable and I was afraid of infection. It is Saturday and my neck chin and cheeks are completely tore up, peeling and itching. this product has ruined my skin! I want to cry."
"Neutrogena has always been a brand I trust. I used this Triple Age Repair for three days and it burned my face! The rash stung and my face looked chapped and raw. By the third day my eyes were actually swollen shut from this product, and I stopped using it. Had to see a doctor, who called it a ""Chemical Burn"". Now I can only use Vaseline on my face until the redness and itching subside. Two weeks later, and my face is still stinging and itchy! Buyer Beware !!!"
"I purchased this product recently. Although I use other Neutrogena products (I use and love the Hyaluronic gel line), this particular cream resulted in an itchy, red reaction on my face and neck, so I will discontinue use."
"Additionally, the product is a bit too heavily fragranced and is almost distracting when trying to fall asleep."
"I have used Neutrogena products for years without problems, especially the regular night cream and suntan lotions. I tried this product as something new. After 3 uses I am convinced that the cream is giving me a rash. I have itchy spots and small red welts. After reading through others' reviews, I suspect that I am allergic to one of the ingredients, Hexinol or Vitamin C. Why hasn't Neutrogena included a warning and instructions on its packaging?"
My skin looks radiant and clear with this wonderful product.
"Skin is clear, soft, youthful and needs no makeup!"
"My face and neck are on fire - red and itchy and burning, after using it just once."
I love it!!!!!
"Finally a product that works and a low price,thanks Neutrogena."
This one made my face turned red with bumps and itchy
MILAGROS AGUILAR
PERÚ
Desde que edad se puede utilizar esta crema?
Bought this past week and so far it's great! But I'm curious if this product is non comedogenic??? I can't find it anywhere on the packaging.
This has improved my skin and given it an overall smoother look. It also protects my skin from the sun. I onlywish I found it sooner.
"i been using this product , but i noticed that i am itching and and my face fells dry... i dont like it."
"Why oh why do companies add fragrance to these products? I have allergies to just about everything, and as a guy it's a huge turnoff to use a scented product. And it's not even pleasant."
"I normally use neutrogena products. I have sensitive skin, however over all I good skin, pretty neutral. This was the first anti aging product I've tried and my skin reacted negatively. I was planning to use it more as a preventative product. I would still like to try other products, however this one was not the one for me."
My face and neck broke out in a rash and my eyes are swollen. I have to go to the doctor over this product and it isnt cheap to start with let alone have to pay a doctor and get medicine. I saw in one of the reviews that the reviews that had a negative reaction was because we used it wrong. I did not use it wrong and only put on a very small amount. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.
"I wanted an aging night cream & decided to try this cream. I use all neutrogena products with no issues, but this product cause me to break out in very itchy painful rash all over my face & neck. This has never happened to me before with any other product. I wasn't sure if it was this product at first & gave it another try, stupid me! Same thing happens again. Now that my rash has heal my skin is a very dry husk & to the point where it hurts, I'm taking this back to the store."
"Horrible reaction to this product after using the first time! Red, itch and burning! 3 days later and still bothering me. Any suggestions on how to get relief appreciated. If you had this problem, how long did it last and what did you do for relief??"
Neutrogena is one of the best skin care products on the markt. The price is beyond reasonable.
"I had burning and stinging on my face and neck that left my skin red, dry and swollen."
I just purchased this product on yesterday my skin does
feel smoother and softer.
This is my first night using thus cream. My face hydrated and moisturized. I'm waiting to see if it takes care of the fine lines. Stay tuned!
"I have used the cream just for a week and its the first time a cream gave to my face itchy, redness and dryness and my skin isnt sensitive, I wont recommend this product, so I decided to go back to my previous cream."
Neutrogena Triple Age Repair Anti-Wrinkle Night Moisturizer works great for my older skin and feels smooth and does not just sit on top of the skin but rather my skin seems to drink it up! I recommend this product for all ages with dry skin.
"I apply at night. Have been using for 3 weeks. So great, I leave on until about noon the next day when I shower after chores and yard work. Then I get dolled up and put in makeup and my complexion is noticeable brighter. Great product!"
"I don't normally write reviews, but recently have come to depend on others comments. I could not find my favorite......Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night......so purchased this one. Very Disappointed!! The product is thinner, not as creamy, just like a cheap moisturizer. My face does not feel soft and moisturized the next morning, like it did before. I really hope they have not discontinued the Ageless Essentials Continuous Hydration Night!!"
"I purchased this because the store I go to no longer carries ageless essentials night cream :( I had only purchased it once but loved it! So I decided to try this. The first thing you notice is the strong scent which smells like something for individuals with more mature skin, anyways,upon application this product stung my skin and after a few days my skin dried out especially around my mouth and I began peeling. :("
What is it about Neutrogena that always burns the living daylights out of my skin?!!! This is supposed to be a moisturizer and it burns.
"Love the jar , the consistency of the cream , make my face very smooth and super humectant! Love it! I'll will buy again! Thanks!"
"I thought this product was fragrance -free, but it has a strong smell like cheap perfume. Can't stand it."
Skin was in better condition than without product but skin was about the same when using other similarly priced moisturizers.
