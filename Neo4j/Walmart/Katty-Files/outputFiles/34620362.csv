"I bought this cream about 4 month ago, my skin has never looked better. Everyone tells me ""you look so great"". I just love the cream and hope it will always be available"
"I tried so many different products that I believe it was too strong. Irritated my skin and made look worse, with acne, red skin...."
This cream is light and no irritation at all.
"Very nice light and fluffy cream. Non oily, applies and is quickly absorbed. Great it has SPF 25 included so no needed for added daily sun protection. Has Hexinol and vit C. Targets 3 skin issues. Smooths look of wrinkles, evens tone and firms. Says not to apply to eye area so I also use an separate eye moisturizer."
Only had a few days to use this so cannot comment on it helping wrinkles and firming. Has a mild fragrance that fades quickly. Look forward to using longer for more results.
"I received my Neutrogena Triple Age Repair Moisturizer from Spark reviewer. I've tried many different Neutrogena products in the past and think it's a great name brand. This moisturizer blends very well and lasts all day. I have extremely dry skin and this worked very well for me. A little bit is all you need. There is no fragrance to it and did not make me break out, I have sensitive skin so that is always a concern for me. I also love the fact it has an SPF 25. I would definitely recommend this Neutrogena moisturizer."
I already used the Triple Age Repair Night time moisturizer & like that.
Decided to purchase the day time moisturizer & glad I did.
Finally found a product that works for me - have definately seen an improvement
in my skins appearance!
I been using this for couple years and I love how it feels in my skin it works
"For those of you with sensitive skin, and in my case some trouble with rosacea, you will find this product helpful in several ways. First, it's main purpose to moisturize while providing a delicate scent. The SPF 25 sun protection is also very important to keep the sun from aggravating the rosacea or any other condition of delicate skin. I researched this product and read reviews and it seems everyone is as happy as I am with the quality of this moisturizer."
"This cream is smooth and creamy. It smells nice. After washing my face with a gentle facial scrub and applying this moisturizer, even hours later, my face feels smooth. The cream rubs in easily; it's not greasy so it doesn't leave your skin looking greasy or oily. The cream made my skin have a nice glow to it, usually my skin is dry looking. I find it hard to find products that I really like but I like this moisturizer a lot."
Not greasy and absorbs very quickly. I use it twice a day to keep skin hydrated.
"I brought my products a month ago, I am so happy the way my skin looks and feels!!!"
"I have been using Triple Age Repair daytime moisturizer nearly two years and still think that it is diminishing my wrinkles. It doesn't cause me to break out, doesn't feel too sticky. I've tried a couple other moisturizers suggested to me by friends and I keep returning to my Triple Threat! I love this and hope Neutrogena will continue to make it for years to come, or else develop something equally good that 65-year-old me will be able to use in 10 years. Absolutely recommend this product!"
"I just received it, so far love it. Bought 2 cannot wait to see a difference. Thank you for the great value."
"I am a 60+ year old man working in a profession that seems to value youth over wisdom. I have been using this product and the Rapid Wrinkle Repair, twice a day, for about a year and am frequently guessed as being considerably younger. And, the price is great. (Watch out kids.)"
"I have used this Neutrogena Triple Age Repair Moisturizer SPF 25 for a couple of weeks now. I love the scent of the cream. It's not too strong but a nice subtle fragrance. I'm one who doesn't like the unscented items. It isn't greasy feeling like some moisturizers with sunscreen. It provides great protection in the sun as well. I'm in a cold and dry climate especially now, and it's working great to moisturize. As far as age repair, I don't think I can truly comment on that aspect since I've been using it for a short time."
"I haven't used it every day because I forget. Also when I use it and go outside when the sun is out, I sweat a lot. I wiped it off and no more sweat. It does seem to make my face a lot softer. Haven't had it long enough to make sure it will repair or not."
"Finally a moisturiser with a SPF that I can stand and works great!!! Neutrogena triple age repair moisturizer has a nice light scent,it is a thick rich formula and when applied to your face it sinks into your skin,so you don't have to walk around with a greasy face.I've tried many SPF day creams and most of them stink or drive my face crazy.Neutrogena always has quality products,and this day cream is fabulous!!"
"I have sensitive skin! I bought this in Jan 2019, and ready for a second jar. People asked me what I use for my face. I have it in my purse all the time because I love the fact it is spf 25."
"This cream addresses three issues: wrinkles, uneven tone and firmness. It also has an spf of 25 which I love because I don't need to use a separate sunscreen. This is a nice everyday moisturizer and doesn't irritate my skin."
"After using this Triple Age Repair SPF 25 Moisturizer. My face and neck starting itching (I put it on my neck as well). And like the other reviewers mentioned, little bumps started to appear and my skin got red and felt very irritated. I took me a while to realize that it could be this product that was causing it. I stop using it. And gradually the itching, bumps, and irritation began to subside. It took at least 4-6 days before the terrible side effects of this Neutrogena went away."
"Because of the reviews, I started out slowly, applying a small amount of moisturizer on my damp 71 year old skin and then slightly increased the amount over time. My dry skin is now soft, the fine lines and unevenness of my skin tone have diminished. Thank you, Neutrogena, for putting everything, including SPF, that I need in one product line. I love it and am buying more, please keep this line!"
"I have been using this beautiful product for about a week and my skin has a clarity that I haven't seen before! not only does it sink in nicely, I don't become oily which is amazing considering I have oily skin. It is absolutely stunning under makeup and (btw, I am using much less makeup) My skin has not been sensitive to this product at all like many of the other reviewers. I now need to get the PM cream to go with this day cream. i am in awe! I have been using la mer and all the expensive stuff with less results."
"I've always loved your products and just found this one. Have only used for 1 week but in love with it more each day. I have dry skin and it moisturizes great. Makeup goes on extremely well and as I said before, my skin looks like it is glowing from within. Thank you."
"My face has freckles and blemishes but under control now with the help of this product. All my facial regimens are consist of this brand, helps me with my uneven tone ant deep wrinckles. It makes my skin well nourished, it blends well with my daily make up. Most ot my patients thought that I am still in my late twenties and or early thirties but infact, I am almost 45y/o. Thank you Nuetrogena!"
I used to use I like Neutrogena Visibly Firm Lift Active Copper. Great product! but just discontinued. so disappointed because it could firm and lift my skin. This product just not as good. wish it could have Firm Lift Active Copper ingredients and results. Please bring Visibly Firm Lift Active Copper back!!
"I have used Neutrogena products for years and I absolutely love the sunscreen. But for some reason my skin did not react well to this. I have little bumps all over my cheeks and chin, and I have had two really bad breakouts (my skin is usually pretty clear). I am going to stop using this immediately."
"This product is more expensive and not nearly as good as the Intensive Day Moisturizer SPF 15 which Neutrogena took off the market. It has a slightly unpleasant odor which fortunately dissipates quickly. Hydration is okay but not great. What I really dislike about it is that it takes quite a while to absorb and then will peel and flake off if you touch it. It's okay in a pinch, but there has to be something a lot better out there."
"First time trying this product and it works great! I've used many other skin moisturizers with varied results but this one is a keeper. It has a nice clean scent, goes on easy and the best part it absorbs right into your skin! After you apply the the moisturizer your skin looks amazing and feels so soft! Glad I tried it and hope this helps those looking for a great moisturizer."
I usually do not have sensitive skin and my skin reacted horribly to this product. My eyes and face are swollen and my skin is burning. I think I need to visit my dermatologist. Based on some of the other reviews I am reading there has to be something in this product that is causing this reaction. Very disappointed and would not recommend this product.
"Be very careful with this product. I used it only twice and it left my face red, rough, and swollen right now. I used Neutrogena sunscreen all the time with no issue. I haven't had any problems with other moisturizers. This is the very first time with severe reaction. It might work for you skin type. But as said, I never had skin reaction with other moisturizers."
I've been using Neutrogena for many years. Purchased the Triple Age Repair Moisturizer three weeks ago. This product is amazing. I'm 64 and my skin hasn't looked this good since my twenties. Wish I could take a bath in it to help the rest of me look this good! Lol
"After 2 days of use, my face was covered in tiny red bumps. The next morning I woke to a red swollen face as well as extreme burning and itching. I have never had any type of allergic reaction to face products and I have used other Neutrogena products for years with no issues. Heed my warnings, I feel & look terrible. Do not recommend!"
I have been using this product for over 3 years and have been happy with it.
I have tried other moisturizers but I seem to always return to Neutrogena.
"Really excellent, deep moisturizing night cream. Makes my skin feel great, especially when getting sun."
"the skin became so dull, it acts like a peel right 5 minutes after I apply the cream on my face... so obviously must be left alone and without makeup... I don't use many cosmetics, but if I don't have a basic makeup on, I am not myself."
"I wanted to love this like the other Neutrogina products I use. But after 2nd day of use, my face had mild rash and burning/itching sensation. Two days later it still hurts! Will not try again!"
Meets the high expectations for my aging skin. Have had a lifetime of experience with skin creams and finally have the one the works best for me. I love this product!
"i have used Neutragena products, particularly face lotion for over 27 years without problem, but the second time I used this product I woke up with severe red rash and puffed up eyes."
For some reason this cream does not blend well on my face - leaves my face looking like it is peeling! I have used several other Neutrogena products and have never had this problem. Any ideas why?
I've been using this as a sunscreen and moisturizer. It has worked well for me. I love the price for your products but I'm wondering if you have anything like this that contains antioxidants and lipids?
I have used Neurotgena products for years. I have been using this product and my face is breaking out. I'm upset because I spent a lot of money for this to happen.
The women in our family have been using Neutrogena products for years. I am seeing a slow but nice improvement in skin. Thank you neutrogena for taking care of the women in our family for years with your wonderful products.
I've used this product for about one week. It caused a slight burning sensation when applied and has since created dry patches around my eyes forehead and upper lip. In the morning my eyes looked like they were swollen.
My skin feels silky and soft. My skin looks very glowing and hydrated I usually don't like other Products Bit my mom let me use it. Best thing I've used in a long time never felt so good about my skin
I have been using this product for about a week and it made my skin better after the first day. My skin is nice and soft and smooth looking. No irritation at all. Love it.
"I have been using this product for 2 weeks and love it. I have better skin tone using it. Love the smell and smoothness of my skin. Not sure about wrinkles because I don't think I have used it long enough, but so far I am loving it."
"Just tried this as I was looking for a moisturizer with sunscreen. Within hours a red flush had appeared and today (3days later) after not using it since the one time, my face is still splotchy, itchy, and puffy. I knew I couldn't use retinol but I checked the box first and did not see it listed. Apparently I can't use hexinol either. Just an FYI for those allergic to retinol as you may have the same reaction."
This moisturizer does the job it claims.
I have used this product twice and I woke up with a swollen itchy face that looks like a reaction to something in it. It's the only thing I have done different in the last 2 days and the rash is only on my face where I used the product. I love Neutrogena products and have used the Daily lotion for years. I switched to this for something heavier in the cold weather.
OMG I love this product. My skin look so much younger. Please please don't take this product away. I will keep buying it. Thanks
"I love Neutrogena and have used it for years. Unfortunately, within a few hours of the first usage, my cheeks are on fire!!"
This cream is so easy and smooth to apply. I use it on my face and neck and I feel completely protected all day.
Love this product.
"Neutrogena has always been a brand I trust. I used this Triple Age Repair for three days and it burned my face! The rash stung and my face looked chapped and raw. By the third day my eyes were actually swollen shut from this product, and I stopped using it. Had to see a doctor, who called it a ""Chemical Burn"". Now I can only use Vaseline on my face until the redness and itching subside. Two weeks later, and my face is still stinging and itchy! Buyer Beware !!!"
"Skin is clear, soft, youthful and needs no makeup!"
"Plumps wrinkles, makes my skin hydrated. I'm in my 50's. Smells great. This stuff WORKS!"
I love this cream. It makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. Similar products are no comparison!
Bought this past week and so far it's great! But I'm curious if this product is non comedogenic??? I can't find it anywhere on the packaging.
This has improved my skin and given it an overall smoother look. It also protects my skin from the sun. I onlywish I found it sooner.
"i been using this product , but i noticed that i am itching and and my face fells dry... i dont like it."
My face and neck broke out in a rash and my eyes are swollen. I have to go to the doctor over this product and it isnt cheap to start with let alone have to pay a doctor and get medicine. I saw in one of the reviews that the reviews that had a negative reaction was because we used it wrong. I did not use it wrong and only put on a very small amount. I would definitely not recommend this to anyone.
"I had burning and stinging on my face and neck that left my skin red, dry and swollen."
I just purchased this product on yesterday my skin does
feel smoother and softer.
This is an awesome moisturizer and I have been using it for years...other stores sell for $24 or more...Walmart has the best prices although I can't always find this product in stock...Stock more Walmart at the Rocklin store...
Skin was in better condition than without product but skin was about the same when using other similarly priced moisturizers.
