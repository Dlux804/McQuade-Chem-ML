This has worked wonders for my skin in just two weeks fading spots and helping clear acne
"I bought this product a few days ago and started to use it today. It's my first time to use Equate product, so far I like this especially that the product smells good with its citrus scent. The cream is also smooth and non greasy which makes it easy to spread on the face. I can't say much now about what this product can do to my face esp. to my dark spots, I have to wait for some time and will update u about the results. I hope this isn't another bogus item out there =)"
"Using this product at nighttime for over a year, I've had some lightening of my age spots. I would say they are diminished by about 50%. There has been a ""plateauing""effect, with most of the lightening occurring in the first few months While I may be ""stuck"" at a plateau with this product, I continue to use it, as it leaves my face with a nice smooth feeling in the morning. It has tightened my pores and evened out my skin tone. Finally, this product fits my budget better than most others. -68-year old woman."
I do think this moisturizer has helped to make my skin tone more even and decreased the appearance of my dark spots. However the smell is AWFUL... I can only use it at night time and even after washing my face in the morning I sometimes can smell it throughout the day. Once I finish this tube I will have to look for a different product to use.
"I use this as an economical vitamin C source at bedtime. It's not so effective as Equate's pump style Dark Spot Corrector, so I use them both."
"I started using this right after I bought it. The first week it worked well. Worked like the chemical peel moisturizer for my chicken skin on my arms. Then it turned yellow. I'm still using to get rid of it and 'm sure it works okay still but it looks gross to put on now. It started out white and smelled really good, now its like an orangeish yellow."
I really wish someone would have warned me that this product dose not work. I have been using for 4 months almost 5 and still no results. The only think it dose is give a burning sensation.
"I bought this about 2 months ago and have been using it every night on the dark spots on my hands and arm. These areas are now ""tanner"" than the rest of my arms. Actually, the areas where I've used it look like a yellow stain has been applied. The dark spots are unchanged. This product is not doing what it was advertised to do. I'm going to discontinue use and hope the ""stain"" fades with time."
"This product has a foul odor that stays with you after use! Have not seen much fading of spots after using for awhile and after reading other reviews saying that their skin turned yellow after prolonged use, I will not use it any more. It will try calling the number on the bottle to see if I can get a refund but I don't have the receipt any more so probably will have no luck. Gold bond makes great products but I wonder if all the dark spot correctors have the same bad odor."
"Great product, very happy. Great price!"
not clear if it works. Try it out.
