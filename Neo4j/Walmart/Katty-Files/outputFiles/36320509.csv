This stuff is amazing and is so hard to find these days. The shipping was almost instantaneous! And FREE!
I love that this product as it : 1. is certified organic 2. comes in a pump dispenser - sanitary and no waste 3. is extremely effective 4. is very reasonably priced. I am now tempted to try other Nourish Organics products! I'm just waiting to run out of my current stock.
"This face cream not only smells awesome, but is great under my foundation. It works especially well with the Nourish Organics serum."
"This is a very good face, eye and neck cream that is easily absorbed and does not burn or irritate the eyes."
"This skin cream has great ingredients, however I will not buy again as it is not moisturizing enough for my aging dry skin! It does have a wonderful fruity fragrance. The product clogs up around the small opening in the cap so you have to clean it out with a toothpick now and then. If you need a light moisturizer this may be good for you."
"If I were younger and looking for a perfect facial moisturizer, this would be it. I'm in my early 60s now and was hoping for a heavier moisturizer. This was lovely, no strong scent, but just too light for me. I'm trying the Swanson brands which are lovely, so far the COQ10 is my favorite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
