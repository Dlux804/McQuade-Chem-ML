great for fading light spots. not greasy and goes on very lightly
"I heard about this from a dermatologist, but can be purchased cheap at Walmart . It is like a miracle cream. It is my only face moisturizer because it feels great to apply. It feels better on than my expensive moisturizers. I am on my fifth tube and my face looks great! Some of my age spots have all but disappeared. This is the only cream I use for my face. The instructions say to use it for two months, but it is so wonderful I will never use anything else."
I love this item it gives my face so much moisture while lighting my skin. There's no harsh smell like most creams. My face couldn't look better
I had an out of date Fade Cream. In order to get ride of my dark blotches on my face I needed to order a new box. Ambi works great on my skin.
Excellent product! Tones uneven skin blotches.
You can't just use this sporadically or for a month or two and expect your sun spots to be gone. I have been using it for over a year on my arms and hands and they have faded. Not completely gone but very light now compared to what they were. For the price this is a very good product.
Works ok on medium or light skin . But it doesn't work well on dark skin complexions .
Works well not too expensive
"We wanted to switch to 2% Hydroquinone based product since prescribed (4%) was irritating my wife's sensitive skin. The reviews were great, it was recommended by dermatologist, so we bought this, but apparently even 2% is too much, got rashes. Had to return it."
Do not waste your money on this product. I have olive skin tone and have some sun spots on my cheeks. I applied this once a day for one month and saw no changes to my sun spots. They didn't even lighten a little bit. This product also has a horrible smell.
"I don't really see any results in my skin yet, so I'm going to use it a little longer and see if that helps."
Dark spots begin fading within weeks of using this product. I dont have sensative skin so there was not irritation or further issues. Works great!
"So far this has been the best fade cream I have tried. I've used Clinique, Gold Bond, Porcelana, lemon juice and some others. None of those really did anything. Ambi doesn't remove the dark spots but at least they are a little lighter."
Don't waste your money. I have light/medium skin (more towards the light side). I have one dime size dark spot on my cheek and then a few smaller acne marks. I used this cream for over 2 months. No change whatsoever.
Horrible. I'm 47 and have breakouts all over face. I use AHA's and BHA's and retinols time time and sometimes coconut nut oil and never had breakouts like this. I should've kept using Palmer's Skin Success fade gel which cost a lot more per ounce.
"Too early to tell. Smells nice, which is good. Certain areas of my face though, it has caused breakouts. Mainly though, got it for the back of my hands."
This works better at fading the spots than the expensive cosmetic brand and the cost is a fraction of the brand name.
I still have to wait for the full effect. I can see no change to my dark spots as of yet. Takes up to 3 months to show a change
