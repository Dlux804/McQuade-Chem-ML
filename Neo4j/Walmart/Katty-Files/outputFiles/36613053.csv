"I have been using eb5 since I was 27-years-old. Today I am 57 and look great! Thank you, eb5, for keeping me young!!"
"I've been using eb5 for over 30 years now! My 9 year old grandson lives with me and people are shocked when they learn I'm his grandma, not his mother!"
I have used eb5 for thirty years I know. I'm 76 in August and people tell me I look 60. I love the stuff. I have several friend that now use it plus my daughter has started.
"I purchased eb5 intense moisture anti aging cream over one year ago and my skin has never looked or felt better!!! My skin is smooth and silky, it doesnt leave a greasy feeling at all which i absolutely love, and my friends are constantly asking me if ive had cosmetic surgery! I have not ! Now my 84 year old mother uses this product as well and she absolutely loves it !!!"
Thank you eb5 ! Ill never use another cream now but eb5
"Ive tried many many facial creams and not having the results i desired, but since using eb5 facial treatment my skin feels like silk! My age spots have disappeared and ill never ever change to another product again ! I turned 59 years old this year naturally worrying about aging, but my skin just glows now with healthy results now so turning 59 didnt bother me a bit! all my friends comment on how beautiful my skin is , so THANK YOU eb5 !!! Im buying more for my 39 year old daughter to start using..."
My friend recommended this to me when I was in my early 30's and I have used it diligently since then. I will turn 60 this summer and when people ask me is I use anything I tell them eb5. They tell me that they are going to start right away and they wish they knew about it sooner.
I have been using eb5 facial treatment for several years. I am very pleased with this product and have recommended it to many friends and some of them switched from the product they were using to eb5. I am almost 81 years of age and people are always asking what skin care I use. It has kept my skin healthy looking and I have very few wrinkles.
"I started using EB5 in my mid thirty's, I am 68 now. I loved it! When they quit selling it at JC Penney's, I started having trouble finding it. Wal-Mart carried it for awhile. Then you changed the formula and it was not the same. I ordered your Intense Moisture EB5 online. I feel dry, after application. I really wish I could still get the original EB5."
Have used this item for 25 plus years and happy with the product. Does what it says it will do
"My grandmother has been purchasing this product for decades! Because she is not familiar with online ordering, she has had me ordering this product for her for the past couple of years. She just celebrated her 95th birthday and looks absolutely fabulous! She is living proof that this product really works! Amazing!!!"
"My mother is 90 years old. She has been using eb5 for 50 years. It has become more and more difficult to purchase your product in retail stores. So, my sister-in-law and I buy it on line for her and she doesn't have to shop for it!"
"I like the moisturizer, I just wish it had sunscreen. My skin is very sensitive and this moisturizer did not break me out I blemishes. For that alone, I love it."
"Even though this has become increasingly hard to find I manage to find it over the internet. The last large jar I got directly from the manufacturer. I get great results and have through the years, 20-30 or more, and would not think of using anything in its place."
"I have been using eb5 for over 20 years. I love this product because it smooths my skin and doesn't cake up when applying make-up. Although my skin is worn by neglect due to the sun, it looks much better after applying eb5 onto my skin.I am a grammie of four grandkids and two great grandkids but many people can't tell my true age."
"I have been using eb5 for almost 25 years +/-; the results of which have been above and beyond amazing. People are very surprised when I tell them my age and so often tell me how beautiful my skin is. I just ordered eb5 for my 16 year old granddaughter who ""wants her skin to look like mine when she gets to be my age"" - probably not a higher compliment!"
"I have tried many facial cream brands and eb5 is my favorite for the following reasons: it leaves no residue and soaks into the skin, it elevates fine wrinkles and feels wonderful on the skin. I have given eb5 facial cream to friends as gifts and they love it too."
"Years ago my mother came to visit. I hadn't seen her for a few months. I took one look and said, ""Since when did you start wearing makeup?"" She told me it wasn't makeup - and that's when I started using EB5 face cream. Now people consistently tell me I look 10 years younger than my age (only when I tell them my age!). I highly recommend this face cream. Excellent return for your money!"
"My mother has been using this cream for years. Since it is not available in any stores, she asked me to order it for her. I was curious so I got myself some and what a difference. My skin is so much smoother and even after applying before make-up, my skin is not shiny. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for several years and have been very happy with it. I had stopped using it for awhile because I couldn't buy it locally. I had tried another brand and didn't like it all. I decided to buy it again even though I have to purchase it on-line.
"I originally bought Eb5 because it was hypoallergenic and fragrance free, I have very sensitive skin."
"I loved it so much, I've never tried anything else. I've used the original face cream exclusively since my 20's."
This is what 54 years old can look like with Eb5
"I have been using this product for years, but never knew I could get it from Walmart online, and cheapest by far. It was a pleasant surprise. Even more surprised was it happened to be on clearance, and they gave me that price at checkout. All I want to say is that please continue to carry this product, if not in store, at least online. Please. Please."
"I have used EB5 for over30 years; have tried other, more expensive products but always come back to EB5. I cave sensitive skin and have never had adverse reactions to EB5 as I have had with some other products.I wish that Walmart would carry it again in their stores. I was delighted to find it at a good price on Walmart.com. Will purchase again."
This is the best face cream you can buy and the price isn't bad either cause it really works. I love it and have been using it for yrs. I was out of it for a couple months and I could tell the difference in my skin. Couldn't wait to get some more.It's creamy and smooths on to your skin- feels so good!
"I have been using eb5 since the 1990's, or maybe even the 1980's. My mother saw an article in the newspaper and ordered the lotion. I have been using it ever since, and have just convinced my 48-year old friend to start using it this year. I would not use anything else."
"I have been using the Eb5 cream for a number of years by now and my very sensitive, fragile and dry skin (including acne rosacea) has improved in a most wonderful way. The cream also seems to be effective in keeping wrinkles at bay which, of course, is an extra benefit. My skin is now healthy and smooth and I can warmly recommend the cream to anyone with dry, to very dry skin."
"I have been using eb5 Intense Moisture Anti-Aging Skin Care Cream for 10 years. It is the best product on the market. I have tried several much more expensive facial creams, and they were not nearly as effective as the eb5 facial cream. This is an excellent product."
"I have been using this product for over 20 years. It's fabulous, non-irritating, non-greasy and no scent for those of us who are sensitive. have been told that I look 10 years younger than my actual age, so it must be working! It has recently been hard to find so I was thrilled when I saw this on the Walmart website. I will never run out again..."
"I have used eb-5 moisturizer for years, but the last couple of jars I have received are not smooth--the moisturizer has little clumps in it that do not dissolve when it is applied so I have to pick the white clumps off my face. Normally I just love this moisturizer but I cannot recommend it with this coagulating problem. I hope the manufacturing process improves because I would hate to stop using it."
"I first used EB5 several years ago and then went for years not using it, then I remembered it when I was having some terrible skin issues and gave it a try again. The texture/consistency seems to have changed, however it works beautifully and I much prefer it over the Olay, Cetaphil and the Neutrogena I had been using and it restored my skin to where it needed to be and I think my skin is in much better condition than it was before. This is now my moisturizer of choice and will remain so."
I have used EB5 for years ( over 30) . It is really great. My face doesn`t dry out and I don`t have any wrinkles to speak of. I am 77. I can not get along with out it. I use it every morning and after every shower. My face does not feel greasy I would recommend it to any one.
"This cream is awesome! I use it everywhere. I really can tell a difference on my neck and chest area. I have very sensitive skin and I have not had any issues using it. I've wasted a lot of money on other creams, but this is definitely a keeper. Thanks eb5 for such a great product!!"

"I had plenty of the larger size but needed a travel size in a hurry. I was not going to use just anything on my face so called eb5 company and ordered the small size just for my trip which included a plane trip and you can only carry under 3 oz cosmetics etc. When I called the costumer service person was a big help, she had it sent quickly and it made it to me with 2 days to spare. Thank you so much for your help!! I love your products and your service, have for 20 plus years. Will never use anything else on my skin."
I bought the eb-5 Facial Treatment for my wife. She is very selective in all of her facial products but this one she swears by since my initial purchase over 15 years ago. She will not even try any other cream.
"She just turned 61 years old and does not even look like she is in her 50's. She is fair skinned, Caucasian and of Irish decent. Your product has lived up to its reputation and advertising!"
I've been using this facial treatment since I received a sample in a Glossy Box and I absolutely love it. It gives just the right amount of moisture without feeling greasy and I can see a noticeable difference in my complexion since using the product.
I love this moisture ever since a friend my mine recommended it and I tried it. I have really enjoyed it and have kept buying it ever since. I've even gone and bought the Mens moisture for my husband whose has a dry face. He is loving it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I found a sample in the bottoms if my makeup drawer and threw it in bag while packing for vacation..... I didn't know is was such a great product. After using the sample on vacation I immediately googled the brand and ordered 3 products....my new one and only, and a great price."
I have been using this product for probably 20+ years & love it. It is wonderful under make-up & also a great night cream. Wrinkles are minimized & it feels so good on your skin - with no perfumes to annoy you. I even have both my adult daughters using EB5 facial cream.Thank you EB5 for continuing to make this excellent product!!!!!!!
"I've used EB5 for over 30 years and I absolutely love the product! I've tried other creams before, but EB5 has them all beat, hands down! Even though I'm in my 60's, everyone tells me I look so young for my age! That is what EB5 will do for you.......it truly is an incredible product! I'll never use anything else."
"I have been using EB5 at least 40 years! I am nearly 73 years years old and people can not believe that I have not had cosmetic surgery! When my aunt had her face life 40 + years ago her plastic surgeon told her when she healed to start using EB5! She told me about it and I have used it ever since! The only place that I can buy it now is on line - it's ashamed it is not available at any department store! It is not greasy and has no fragrance! I use it in the morning and evening! Love, love my EB5!"
"I have been using eb5 for many years. It does exactly what it advertises to do. It is a superior product and I have never been tempted to use another manufacturer's product. It is the only one for me. I use it in combination with the Collagen Serum. I have a practically wrinkle free face. Definitely happy, and I will continue to be a faithful customer."
"I have been using the eb5 facial cream and eb5 eye treatment cream for at least 15 years I love these two products and my skin always looks radiant and soft. A little advice you should have coupons or discounts for your loyal customers. Sincerely, Elizabeth Martinez"
"Been using eb5 for over 30 years... It all started with a tiny ad in a local paper. When I was younger eb5 worked well with my oily skin, now in my 60's, and well into hot flashes, eb5 still is the best for me. There was a time when I'd fall prey to name brand, celebrity advertisements about other skin creams but have always come back to eb5. Thanks eb5..."
I first heard about eb5 back in the 1980's and have used it ever since. I am so glad I can get it online since not too many stores near me carry it. A specialty item for so many I guess but I find it the best for my skin and pocketbook. Such a good product that I will never change and have recommended it to others who are now hooked on it too.
I have used this product for 32 yrs. Great for all these years. Available long before all the others. I am 75 with very good skin thanks to Eb5.
I have been using this cream for a little while and I am very pleased. This cream lasts all day and I have sensitive skin and this cream works out fine for me.
"Bought this cream for the kind of reviews it had and wasn't disappointed. It goes on smooth, moisturizes really well and makes my skin look great! Will repurchase once I run out!"
"I might like the product, but ever since I ordered and gave my email address, I have been inundated with spam. This makes me rethink my decision to buy from your company!"
"My Mother, sister, and I have all used it for 30 plus years. We think it's the best facial cream out there. My friends compliment my skin, so I tell them to buy EB5"
"I began using EB5 after my mother recommended the products. She used them for years. I am 78 years old and get complements a lot of the time for looking much younger than my age. I credit EB5 and, of course, good genes for this fact!!"
This is the most wonderful facial cream I hae ever used. My face feels soft and the pore texture is much better.. I love it and will continue to use this product.
"I have used his product for 30 years, I now have to purchase online since it is no longer available locally."
"That is not a problem with me since I love the eb5 products, my mother recommend them to me years ago."
I have been using this product for years. It is an effective light creme for night or day. It moisturizers without being greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm allergic to most face creams. This is the best I have ever tried. Consumer reports had rated very high so had to try. Love it but it's hard to find. An excellent cream for aging skin.
I started using eb5 after we returned from a tour of two years in Iceland. My facial skin was rough. I tried several creams and nothing worked. I have been using eb5 for over 25 years and love it!
"I LIKE THE FACT YOU ONLY HAVE TO USE EB 5 AS A DAY AND NIGHT CREAM ,,AND IT LASTS ME FOR A GOOD 6 MONTHS **** LIKE GETTING A FREE GIFT **** [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin has always felt drawn and tight, as if nothing can be fed into it. This is by far, the best moisturizer I've ever used. My facial skin feels supple, it just drinks it in. I never want a day without using it."
Have bought EB5 for over 20 years! Most say I have great skin and look 20 years younger! Not bad for a 77 years old man! :-) Would attach picture BUT it says my image is too short .. NOT!!!
I've been using eb5 products for many years now. I swear by them...and when I wander I always come back. I wish eb5 would make a facial sunscreen that complemented the daily Facial Treatment.
I have used all of the products for many years until now. The facial cream has changed and I so sad because I loved eb5 products....I am trying other products now.
I've been using EB5 for over 30 years - I switched to another product a couple of times and quickly realized that EB5 was the only product that helped make my skin look and feel great! It definitely helps reduce AND prevent wrinkles.
I have been using EB5 moisturizer for several years now I I really am happy with it I use the cream twice a day. So much better for me than other expensive moisturizer's.
This is the best cleanser I have found for my face. It cleans but does not dry my skin or leave it oily. When I run out and have to use other cleansers I can really tell the difference.
This cream actually has prevented wrinkles on my skin. I use it with the eb5 collagen serum which intensifies the great results. I can't believe the cost. These products are as effective as products costing hundreds of dollars more. I am hooked.
"I have used Eb5 for over 30 years and would be lost without it. Although at 77 years of age I admit to a few wrinkles, my complexion does not show my age."
"I have used this facial cream for several years, and truly love it. It makes my skin feel wonderful. I will be 80 years old this year and everyone thinks I am in my 60's, I know it is the facial cream ."
"I have been using it about 20 years When I run out and can not replace the cream, it shows on my face. I hope you do not quit making it before I cease on this earth."
I've used this for years and people tell me allll the time I don't look 48 years old! Love it!!
"I have been using EB5 since I was 16. My mom gave me my first jar for my birthday! I loved it then and I love it now! I am 53 and everyone always says you do not look 53,,, I stand by and give this product for gifts! Once I do people alway say when did you start using this product it is great!!!"
I was sent this product to try well when I got it the product was watery and I emailed the company to ask them to send me a replacement they wouldn't so I am very angry with them if they had sent me a good product to try I would of been more than happy to try it.

"I have been using EB-5 face cream for over 20 years. Many people have commented on how smooth and wrinkle free my skin is. Although I take very little time with make-up, etc. I believe the face cream has really helped to keep my skin younger looking."
This new product is not as good as the original EB5.
"I have used this product for 15 years, I love it and I buy it for my family members"
Great moisturizer with vitamin's and protectants. Rich and nourishing. Not heavy or oily. Great product!!
I have been using this product for the last 35 years.
I really like it because I have sensitive skin and it is not oily.
Have used product for 35+ years. Only problem I can no longer get Eb5 locally and have to order online.
"Has worked great for many years. Even at 95 people think I'm much younger. My skin is soft , highly recommend for any age person"
I like the product. I like that it doesn't feel oily and it is not fragrance heavy. Time will tell if works for my skin.
Been using EB5 for years and still think it still has the best products on the market. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Have used it for years my skin is very dry the EB5 gives it the moisture it needs. Use it every morning and evening sometimes in between/
I have used this facial cream for years and look much younger than my years. I started using it at age 30 and I am 62 now with no wrinkles!
"I have used eb5 Facial Treatment for years, and just love it. I was so very thankful to have it when we were in the desert for 10 days."
"I wrote you a review . Love the product and have been using it for quite sometime. Although I am 80 years, I am mistaken for 50."
My Mother will use nothing on her face but this anti aging cream. She is 82 and looks like she is in her 60s. I'm going to start using it!
I have used this product many years and have had trouble finding it locally. Happy to get it from Wal mart.
"I've used this wonderful product for many many years. I also use the toner, and together, they have keep me with a youthful appearnance."
"I have been using this product for many years and just love it. I also appreciate the prompt delivery, of all it was exceptional."
"Must have tried everything from spendy to cheap, have aging dry skin and this feels so good and actually works. My aging has improved. haha"
"I love this cream, it really works, and I love it because it is unscented, for I am extremely allergic to perfume smells"
"I have been using this skin cream for several years, and I do not have the deep facial wrinkles of other 80 year old women."
I have been using the EB5 product for over 20 years. My skin is so smooth and wrinkle free that people think I am 20 years younger than I am!
"Product arrived on time and at the best price I have seen. BTW, EB5 is the best face cream I have tried. I have been using it for years."
I have been using EB5 for over 20 years. I get compliments on my skin all the time.there is nothing better than this cream.
I have used eb5 for 30 plus yrs and i beleive i would have had more wrinkles without the cream. I always receive complements on my skin.

I have used this for years. I am 81 years old and am told I have beautiful skin. It's your products that have kept the skin looking good. Thanks
I have used eb5 since I was 20. It has such a nice feeling on my face. I am going to be 69 in July and people just don't believe it!
"I have been a ""user"" of Eb5 Cream for years - use nothing else on my face (no foundation or powder).and will continue to use."
I just started using it but so far I don't like it > doesn't absorb for beans! I'm sure I won't purchase again!
I've been using EB 5 Facial Cream for years (over 10 years) - The ingredients have changed a little over the years but it's really good for my face. It helps smooth wrinkles & make them less noticeable.
"I am 80 years old and have been using EB5 since in my 40's, actually since pharmist Hereford first advertised the product at JC Penny,s. Recommend to many friends!!!!"
I have been using product for 3 weeks and am amazed as the results!!
Eb5 used by 3 generations in my family! We have used this product for decades.
I've been using this for a long time and have one of my daughter also using it
I have been using eb5 for about twenty years. I'm very satisfy with the product.
"I love that my face never feels dry. I use it day and night. Love, love, love it."
This keeps dry patches off my skin and moisturizes.
Excellent product; been using for years!!
I wish I would have bought the cream for dry skin. I purchased for regular skin type.
great deal & on time shipment
"Smooth it on neck area ,don't be stingy with it, and enjoy the results."
"I love it, but I need the toner and you are out. Please send me some. Thanks"
Hydrates your skin. At 80+ I now have very few wrinkles. Jar lasts a long time.
Been using this product for several years. Love it! Love it. I like the way it feels on my face.
A friend recommended and I love it. It is truly a facial treatment.
I have been using it for several years and am very pleased with the appearance of my skin.
I have been using this product for years and just love it.
Living proof used for 30 years
Have used eb5 for years. Would not use anything else.!
it is great I have been using this for years and I think it helps with wrinkles
I have been buying EB5 face moisturizer for more than 5 years now and it really has done wonders.
I HAVE BEEN USING THIS CREAM ALONG WITH THE OTHER EB5 PRODUCTS FOR AT LEAST 15 YEARS. WONDERFUL.
I' be been using this since 1986 and will not quit.
I have been happy with this product for several years.
I received eB5 as a gift originally. I've been purchasing it ever since.
"my wife loves eb5 , I try ordering before she runs out"
I have used this product for 30 years or more. Everyone says I look a lot younger then my age.
I have been using eb5 facial cream for many years and love the way it feels.
I've been using this product for several years. I wouldn't use any other facial cream.
I've been using your facial cream for many years and very happy with it...made in the USA!
I have been using eb5 facial treatment for years. Always getting compliments on how young I look.
"There is absolutely no need to purchase the eb5 eye cream, while this cream may be and can be used on the face and eye area. Just as Heldfond intended it to be used for when originally launched so many years ago. That's why it's called ""5 in 1!"" (1) Face (2) Eyes (3) Neck (4) Hands and (5) Feet. One jar is all that one requires. Save your money girls!"
I have used this for over 30 year..... I have never found a better moisturizer that lasts and covers so well.
"This product is amazing for wrinkle reduction, moisturizing and keeping your skin soft. I won't use anything else!"
"Awesome product that's been around for many, many years. And the price is so great - you get more for less!"
"Happy with the results on this moisturizer. Non greasy , you can go to bed without worrying how you face look."
I have been using EB5 face products for at least 10 years. They are the best I have ever used. I am 67 years and people think I am in my 50s.
My mom has been using this for years. She swears by it and I have to say it helps her look and feel younger!
I have used this product for many years. People always comment how beautiful my skin is and I do not look my age.
"I have been using Eb5 since I was in my twenties and I am now 52. I tried other products through the years, but this is by far the best. Thank you Eb5 for being my BFF!!"
Works great.
"I have been using this product for less than one month and am amazed at the changes in my skin texture and how well my fountain applies over the cream. I could tell a difference after the first application. I feel as though I don't need foundation most days because I GLOW! I was using Olay products and immediately switched to EB5 products after the remarkable difference. Thanks for making me look and feel younger, again!!!"
"I learned eb5 products from a newspaper column in 2004, I am 57 years old at that time, I bought and tried this Intense Moisture Anti-Aging Skin Care Cream. This product did wonders for me; at this writing I have been using this product for the last 12 years no signs of wrinkles, smooth skin with just the regular press powder without using face foundation and I looked 20 years younger of my real age - 68 years old."
One of my friend's mom had the most beautiful skin and I asked her what she used and she told me about eb5 and said that this was a wonderful product! I just had to have this in hopes that my skin would be half as beautiful as hers! I do love this product and feel that it is very helpful in keeping my skin pretty!
I am sure she would recommend to others as she really likes the product.
Have been using this for years. Getting harder to find
"I have been using the serum and treatment for two weeks now. Wasn't sure at first, but stayed with it and now i'm Seeing results and loving eb5! I'm 60 years old and positive I will remain a happy and returning customer."
I bought this several months ago and fell in love with this cream. My face has never felt better than it does when I use eb5 Intense Moisture Anti-Aging Skin Care Cream. Can't live without it anymore.
"I started using it when I saw what it did to a lady. She was in her 70's and she looked 50. Her skin was flawless, tight smooth and young looking. Its been about 6 years I have been using it, I am pushing 50 and people say I look in my late 20's early 30's. :)"
"I honestly don't feel or see a difference.. I read all the reviews and because everyone was so happy about this product and they all had positive experiences, I felt convinced to purchase it. I don't know if they received theirs for free so they wrote positive things but I paid nearly fifty dollars . Therefore, I won't be re -purchashing this eb5 at all ,I actually feel my face very dry since I've been using it."

This creme is amazing! My mom told me about it. It used to be on an infomercial a long time ago and that's how she heard of it. My mom has great skin at 70 years old so I decided to try it. I was spending almost four times the price of this product and although I liked my other product this one is even better!! I don't break out. My skin is soft and smooth. I HIGHLY recommend this product!
"I have been using the face wash, serum and skin care cream for about three weeks. I can already see improvements in lines, softness and overall look and feel of my skin. Wish I would have found this years ago. Love it. Would be great if you made the three products in a kit at a reduced price."
"I've never heard about the brand, bot got a sample size jar in a beauty box, it's my new favourite night moisturiser since then. I'v already bought normal size jar and eager to try everything else from the brand! Seriously great moisturising effect and I'm not feeling it on my face at all! I'm in love with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have extremely sensitive skin and this is the only moisturizer that doesn't cause my skin to turn red and tingly. My mom has been using eb5 for years and she recommended I try it. Once I did, I was hooked! I've been using eb5 intense moisture anti-aging cream for about 4 years now, and have not once had a problem."
It was more than 15 years ago when my mom gave me a jar of the eb5 Intense Moisture Anti-aging skin care cream for a gift. I've used it everyday and my skin feels great. When people ask how old I am and I tell them I am 60 they always seem surprised. I am sure my skin looks younger thanks to eb5. I just ordered a jar of skin cream to surprise my mom for a Mother;s Day gift. Thank you eb5! XO [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My mother and I love this face cream. It keeps our skin so smooth and our base makeup spreads so nicely over it. My mother is going to be 92 and she doesn't look a day over 70! She has been using this cream for years.Oh, and one jar lasts a long long time."
"I bought this a couple weeks ago when my fiancee mentioned my face looked dry. I had samples (thanks!) that I hadn't used yet but once I did I knew this was the product for me. I ordered this without hesitation! Its a couple weeks into using and my fiancee goes on and on about how much better my face is looking already (no longer dry)! My face feels smooth, looks healthy and I even have less of those pesky little lines I was starting to get! Thanks eb5!"
"I have only one complaint about this product - it comes in a jar. Jar packaging allows contaminants to colonize the product (via fingers, spatulas, and even the air) and oxygen to destroy the potential benefits of the antioxidants and other active ingredients. There really is no good reason for this jar packaging. It is a shame as this is an otherwise great moisturizer."
I have been using the Intense Moisture Anti-Aging Skin Care Cream for 25 to 30 years. Recently my daughter and family went on a ski trip and used a jar of my cream. They all wanted it to wear on the slopes; said it is the best moisturizer they have ever used. They are hooked.
"I have been using this product for years. I could not find it anymore until my daughter went on this companies site. I am so happy! Only thing that makes my make-up look good on my face. I am 73, so any product that actually works is impressive! I was almost out when she found it for me! Jo Ann in Bristol, Va."
"I bought this about a month ago,but I have been buying it in the stores for the last 25 years or so. I cant find anything that compares with it. Last month I could no longer get it in the stores,and because my last jar was empty, I turned to your website. There is nothing like it!!"
"I have used Eb5 Intense Moisture Anti-Aging Cream for many, many years and I love it! I have tried other products in the past and nothing compares to it. I really like the feel of it as it goes on my face. It is not oily and my skin feels wonderful after using it. I apply it in the morning before I put on my make-up and at night after I take off my make-up. It's a definite keeper!"
I have been using EB5 for close to 20 years and am consistently being told I look 10 years younger than my current age (now 78). Even my ENT Dr. said all of his older patients w/ younger looking skin use EB5! These past few years I have added the collagen booster to help reduce some of the persistent aging wrinkles.
The EB5 Intense Moisture Skin care cream left my skin feeling refreshed and smooth. I received mine as a sample through the mail. It goes on easily and made my face feel just awesome. I highly recommended this product to both my family and friends. I will be purchasing for myself in the near future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the product using a very small amount to start as i have SUPER sensitive skin. Most products turn my face bright red. I used a little, all was fine so I went for it using it nightly for a week. All I can say is WOW. No redness, just soft, smooth skin. I feel it diminished a few fine lines as well. You only need a small amount with each application. I recommend to everyone."
"I have used eb5 products for many, many years. I am 62 years old and friends tell me I look much younger. I have consistently used eb5 and can only think that the majority of those compliments are based on the fact that I have used the facial treatment daily for at least 20 years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this facial cream for about 3 years now and it has been wondrous for me. I have really sensitive skin that gets dry in the winter but very oily in the summer and I use it year round. Leaves an beautifully soft texture and is perfect for wearing under makeup. The product definitely firms my skin and I've seen improvement in texture for sure over the years. Highly recommend.
"I bought this about 2 months back when I was struggling with dry skin and visible aging. In just 2 months of regular use, my skin is now moisturized and free of any aging signs. I owe all the compliments to eb5 - Intense Moisture Anti-Aging Skin Care Cream."
"Have been using this product daily for more than thirty-five years. I have sensitive skin and most face creams cause redness and rashes, particularly the scented ones. Eb5 is not perfumed and is never sticky. It is absorbed quickly and leaves the skin soft and moisturized. At age 65 I still get compliments about how wrinkle-free and young my face looks. No crows' feet or deep frown lines, and my face feels soft, even during harsh winters."

I started using this product about 6 years ago. It can be difficult to find in stores now so every so often I will try another product. Even Arbonne and other all natural products. They all either make my skin oily or make my fave breakout. eb5 is the one I keep coming back to!
"I was shopping for a safe healthy skincare line and can't be more pleased that I discovered eb5 products. They have all the good stuff your skin needs and none of the bad stuff it doesn't need! eb5 makes it simple to choose the products because you know up front they're gluten free, 100% vegan, Non GMO, cruelty free, paraben free, free of harsh chemicals and fragrances!!"
"Years ago, my mother in law suddenly started to look so much younger, the wrinkles in her face were almost gone, she looked better than I'd ever seen. I asked what she did to make such a huge change? She turned me on to EB5...and I haven't stopped using it since. It feels silky smooth , not greasy, works wonders! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got a sample to see if I wood like this product abd to tell u the truth it was a great product I think u should give more samples and more in a sample so u could really use it and see if it's going to work. But what I got really did the trick so I would buy this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My mom always surprises with new skincare products and this is one that she got me about 3 months ago and I am very happy with it. My skin feels soft, looks brighter and fine lines are less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My Mother have been using this for many years and now I'm using it too and she was right, this is a very good product. It's moisturizing, anti-aging and make your skin soft. I really love this and obviously my Mother as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used eb5 for the past 25 years as a night cream. I always get comments that I have such nice skin. My parents had great skin but I always give the credit to the eb5 I use every night. I have followed the stores when each one has closed, etc. and now I order over the net."
"I am 60 and EVERYEONE tells me my skin looks like a 40 year old! No one believes that I'm 60 and that is spectacular! I credit the EB5 Intense Moisture Anti-Aging Cream. I have used other products and nothing babies my skin like EB5. It is non-greasy, smooth and my skin just soaks it up leaving it smooth and silky! I switched to other products that made my skin red and had bumpy breakouts. When I went back to EB5, the problems went away. I recommend it to everyone no matter how old you are!"
"Now 73 years old. At times my friends play the ""guess how old you look"" game and so far, so good. Don't like to advertise my age but sometimes I can't get out of answering. Have been using EB5 face cream for years and years and the guesses are up to 10 years younger than I am. Just yesterday I was at a dr. appt. and the lady who was assisting looked at my dob and remarked that she could not believe I was 73. Made my day!"
"That's how long I've used eb5 facial cream. An elderly friend of mine told me she used it every day after I had asked her how she kept such moist, supple, and glowing skin. So I have used it faithfully every day since, morning and night. To me it's a magic cream. Tiny dabs are all you need. A 4-ounce jar lasts for 6 months. Now I am in my 70s and people ask me how I have such smooth, supple, and youthful skin. I tell them I owe it all to eb5'smagic cream!"
It was for my mom who is 87 yrs. old. She loves this product. It works wonders for her.
I've used eb5 for 30 years and it's a wonderful product.No wrinkles..
I have used this for 45 years and I'm 80 yrs old and do not have wrinkles.
Had my before Christmas. I use it morning and night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It makes my skin hydrated and moisturized. The reason I gave it a 4 stars is that, I wish it has a little bit of fragrance in it. There should be 2 choices, one for sensitive skin (no fragrance) and one with a little bit of fragrance."
"I love this cream, I've been using I for many years. It softens the skin without affecting my eyes as others creams do. I would recommend it to everyone."
"I've been using eb5 Intense Moisture Anti-aging Skin Care Cream for the past two years and love the way it makes my skin feel - healthy, glowing and soft! It works beautifully for both a night cream and a morning base for make-up."
I love this product and cannot believe how well

I have used EB5 for 25 some years and loved it. My only problem now is The new product is not the same and does not feel the same. Where did the synergex go? I asked the question via email but no response. I want the original back please!
"Creamy, moisturizing, unscented....that's important. I can't take a strong scent on my face. That is a deal breaker and why I return again and again to eb5."
I've been using this product for almost 20 years. It is simple to use with a wonderful smooth and creamy texture. I use the same product in the morning and at night.
