"Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment goes on easily over clean face. You can top it with moisturizer, but that is not necessary on these hot days. It holds moisture in, and gives a smooth finish that glows after I apply my usual foundation. Even if I use it without foundation, I get many compliments on my beautiful skin. That is really something, as I am 76 years old....and have been using Olay products for 30 + years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I can see the difference in my skin's tone and texture. I'm 60 years old and have great because b of this product.
"This product is so AMAZING!!!! I've been using it for the past 6 years, I'm 41 and I work for one of the biggest cosmetics companies in the world. So when I get compliments on my skin on how great and young I look I tell everyone my secret. Please don't discontinue!!!!! I'm so heartbroken"
"I have been using Regenerist luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment for a little over 2 months now and have already seen a tremendous difference in my skin. The redness and blotchiness I used to have on my cheeks and forehead is quickly fading and I can already tell this is going to be one of my ""Go-to"" products that will always travel with me. Even my husband has noticed a big difference in my skin. My skin feels more soft and smooth now, as well. I wouldn't be without it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this product months ago and used it only 1times a day. It took about a month to see my sunspots fading on my face. I was amazed!! If I had used it 2 times a day no doubt I would've seen results sooner! You only need a little. Goes on silky and soaks right in! I had stopped using it for about a month, and I can see my sunspots coming back. I'm gonna start back up on this again. And, its Olay....it's the best skincare...for me!! Try it, you will NOT be disappointed."
The package came without a seal and the direction paper was missing. I was worried that the product was once used before.
I love that it's a great moisturizer but as for evening out my skin tone....not so great. I haven't seen any improvement at all and I'm so disappointed...
"I've tried a lot of products and nothing compares to this! It doesn't leave my skin oily which is extremely important to me. It's even improving the overall look to my skin. I would recommend this to any woman who has been struggling with finding a product, but doesn't want to blow her entire budget looking for something to fix multiple skin issues."
I spend so much money buying this so sad up until now no results.
I'm a 57 years old! Menopause has given me acne! I have medium skin tone and have dark spots from the acne! In only a few days my skin tone has improved! My friends are asking me for my secret! I'm so excited since I have tried everything! I recommend Play Regenerist 100%. Thank you Play!
I saw subtle differences in my skin the moment I used it. As time progresses I saw evening out of my skin's overall texture and appearance it was like I had a glow about me and it wasn't oily greasy or heavy. I really would recommend this to my friend's.
"I have been struggling with sunspots for years. I used Clinique Dark Spot Correcting Serum religiously for years with no significant result. Last month when I was all out, I thought of giving this much cheaper Olay Treatment a try before investing five times more on my usual serum. My dark spots have visibly reduced with 2 weeks of use. I will have to say I am hooked!!!"
"I love the feel when I put on this product. I am Asian with dark spots. I would love to say I've seen a big difference, but I don't really. I'll continue using it since it is a great moisturizer and if one day my dark spots go away..bonus! But I'm hopeful if I use the mask and this line, I'll eventually see a difference.

"I have had several dark spots that have appeared on my forehead that would not go away no matter what I tried. I started using regenerist luminous tone perfecting treatment about 3 weeks ago and not only are they going away, my skin in those areas is now smooth as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have stage 4 cancer and receive chemo treatments twice a month. The treatments had left my skin dry and very dull looking. With no hair, no eyebrows, no eyelashes and dry dull skin, I felt so unattractive. After using the Regenerist Luminous Tone Perfecting Treatment, my skin became, soft, no longer dry and actually gave my face a glow. I feel so much better and not so self conscious about my appearance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"If you use this product as recommended, you will see the effects from the first use on. I have dark discolorations on my face and neck from acne. Using this product for a couple of weeks has been life changing. Thank you Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Since I'm past 65 I had doubts about this product for dark spots on on my face, 2 were very dark brown. The amazing part is that after 3 months they are no longer visible so you know the lighter spots are gone. Love this, hope for those of us in our ""prime"". [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has been added to my daily regiment. It has a lovely smell , it makes my face n neck soft n lifted. It also shows signs of Brightening skin Rosey cheeks. I just started using this luminous over my daily Olay Reginerist, had a lumina ting effect in 2 applications. I just love it n would recommend it to everyone . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was constantly insecure about my dark spots and now I don't have to worry about it any longer. It has almost been a week and people around me can notice difference, so can I. I honestly recommend this product to anyone who is trying to have that even skin tone."
Hello. I'd been using this product for about a week. I have dark spots on my cheek bones. I've been using this cream and all of the area I've been putting the cream is getting very dry and it's very sensitive. I like to know if that's normal? Or if is just a allergic reaction?
My mom used Olay for years. She had the most pretty skin .she was seventh three when she passed.i love the smell of this product and you whole family uses this .face cream soap body wash every day hope to have moms glow.it also helped my skin when going thru chemo.
"Just bought this product and love it. Most Olay products make my skin soft and smooth. But my box promised a free trial size of the Tone Perfecting Cream, which I was looking forward to as well, but it was missing in the box. And their email contact form kept giving me errors when I tried to submit, which I find unprofessional. I don't have time to call them so I was a little put off."
"I really didn't have a whole lot of faith in products and gave it a try, I have to say I am amazed at the differences with my skin over a few weeks. I have been using it for 9 months and I saw someone last evening that I had not seen for 8 months. She could not stop commenting on how great I looked and how beautiful my skin was. That made my day and reminded me that it is working! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product truly gives a new glow to my face, smoothness, better texture, and brightens my face, to the point that age and sun spots are no longer visible, it has removed the aged look of my neck and chest, and it seems like the fine wrinkles have disappeared. I love it, and have just started using on my arms and hands, and it makes a big difference! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Always a skeptic but have been using tone perfecting treatment for 3 months on sun damaged skin. The dark spots have faded by at least 50% . My surgical dermatologist commented and ask what I was using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Not only does this product exfoliates, smooth's skin, but it gets rid of dark spots after about a month of use. I don't use this everyday but I use it a couple times a week. If I was to use like it states I'm sure I would have better results. It is cheap enough to buy for anyone. I would recommend this for anyone with dark spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It is a product, in addition to other Olay products, that are definitely worth buying and having in your bin of products in your bathroom or dressing room or wherever you put on your products and makeup everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product makes my skin tone different from what it was before. After using it everyday, some of the brown spots on my face fades gradually; my skin looks brighter and feel smoother. The only thing I don't like about this product, it feels a little sticky at first when applied to skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm black and the sun is my enemy. I had darker areas on my cheeks and tried numerous products high end to home remedy and after a month I saw no difference. I've used Olay forever so I picked up the Luminous tone corrector and after about two weeks cleansing and using it twice a day the darkness was fading! Needless to say I'm still maintaining my newly even skin tone and with no wrinkles at 51 I'm looking pretty good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Sun exposure generated a lot a brown spots and discolorations in my skin, which made it look dull and old, but after using this product for a while my skin has improved a lot and my tone has evened. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using product for over 15 years. My mother was the one that get to using it and I love it. I like the way it feels on my skin. I was the wash and hand cream to. Everyone said how nice my skin it. Love the e-mail to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Being a smoker has left my lips full of wrinkles...I love this serum because, If I don't forget to use it, I see a great difference..the rest of my face appears to be brighter and more tight..Smooth and soft to the touch.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Olay since I was a young woman. I am now 76 years old. We older ladies also want to have nice skin. I had many imperfections across my forehead and nothing seemed to help. I started using Regenerist on a daily basis and I have seen a marked improvement. Thank you so much for this product and start thinking about the aging skin.

Works! Bought it for my sister! People love my skin. People think I'm much younger than am...which is amusing! Makes me wonder why others don't use this.
Two days of using the product and I already can see the difference. I bought a more expensive product before that I couldn't see the difference and I ran out pretty quick. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is the best product ever I had extremely dry flaky skin due to being raised under high voltage power lines since using this product I'm as smooth as a cantaloupe
It's fine but it's too pricey for the amount they give you and the products are ok but it doesn't work like it says it's good if the price is lower they would get more customers
This product is easy to use and performs well. But it does take about 2 months to see real improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I was hoping that with the price of this product it would fade the dark spots on my cheekbones but after the length of time indicated on the package I have seen no results. Very disappointed.
i do not know why this product doesnt have any expiration date printed on it or even in a box. So disappointing buying a skin care without care to consumers. I am an olay consumer for how many years now butthis specific product disappoint me much. =(
The product is perfect for my delicate skin! The product keeps my skin soft and without wrinkles. It has a pleasant smell. The price is good for my budget. People ask me how do you manage to keep my skin so soft and smooth? I tell them that I use Olay skin lotion.
"I've had a few sun spots for years now. I've tried so many products for months and months, claiming that they removed dark spots, but they always failed. I bought Olay Regenerist Luminous without much hope left. But after only 2 DAYS of use, the larger dark spot on my forehead is pretty much gone. I am blown away. I never write these reviews but this product deserves lots of praise."
"I love the feel of this product and use it for several things - alone, with base, around eyes, as a refresher for dry skin - love it!"
