I got this because I needed a good moisturizer. I normally don't prefer the feel of creams but I really needed one. This one is light and comfortable. Smells good too!
"With the cold weather hitting New England, I decided I finally needed to start using moisturizer. I'm 50 and haven't used facial moisturizer before because my skin was always oily. Now, I know I should have been using moisturizer all along. I picked up Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream and Age Perfect Cell Renewal Day Cream at CVS the other day. After one use, my skin was soothed, soft and the roughness is smoother. I can't believe how healthy my skin looks after just a few days."
My first use of this product and it does a wonderful job. Also the eye cream is so easy to use and it got rid of all the dryness around my eyes.
My favorite nighttime cream. The perfect consistency for my maturing skin.
"I like this line from L'Oréal, but this one is a little thick for my skin. Would probably work for someone with extremely dry skin."
Moisturizes and has helped control my oily skin. Very thick and smells great.
"The cream is thicker than most creams I used buy hey, it moisturizes my skin...The smell don't bother me either.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the non-greasy texture and felt like it penetrated the skin but my goodness, the strong cheap perfume fragrance is just too much."
This is so perfumed that I cannot use it..tried two times...even my husband complained!
I bought this a month ago and it is a good product.
I've tried many night creams and consider this one to be a serious contender. It helps to normalize dry or aging skin and absorbs nicely.
"I applied the product before bedtime and within an hour had to wash my face. I couldn't handle the perfume smell, it was a bit much for me. On top of that it made my skin burn. I would not recommended this product if you have a sensitivity to perfumes at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think it has been working very well for me. I have been using it since I received it in the mail from bzzagent for my honest review. I had a few fine lines around my eyes and laugh lines are fine also and have noticed improvement since starting to try it out. I noticed results in a few days nights if use. Thank you bzzagent for the great opportunity to try out these products for my honest unbiased review in exchange [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This night cream has a yummy light scent and rich moisture. After 2 weeks of use, my skin is very happy! Winter heating reeks havoc on my skin during the night, and this cream not only combats the dryness but actually ""plumps"" my skin so that it is younger and healthier looking in the morning. Who doesn't like to wake up looking refreshed and younger?!? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My Bzzz Mission with L'Oreal age perfect day and night cream was a huge success!!! I received a free trial of the age perfect cell renewal night and day cream along with the eye renewal. I tried the creams and found they left my skin soft and supple. The creams were not greasy had a very pleasant smell and left my skin so soft. It absorbs quickly leaving no greasy residue. I would highly recommend it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this night cream. It smells good, goes on nice and smooth. My skin feels great right away. It says cell renewal so I was hoping for my dark spots to lighten, but over a month of use may not be long enough but I haven't seen a change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i have not uses a night cream before. so this is my fiest experience. i liked how it did not have a crispy dry feeling, like i assumed a night cream would have.i have sensitive skin also so i am very impressed that i did not break out from it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this L'Oréal cell renewal Night time cream moisturizer is a little thick than I like, I don't like to put on thick creams before going to bed, it does seem to absorb pretty well but my skin feels like it has a little too much on, it smells great, and I still plan on using it to see if I love the results after a month of using, I have only used it for 10 days, it might feel better for someone who has very dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It did not absorb into skin and felt thick and heavy in the morning and kind of sticky to touch. It was very fragrant. I did not feel a difference but maybe after prolong use it would have a better effect overall. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream comes in a beautiful gold colored bottle and is heavy, so it makes it feel luxurious. It has a sweet smell, which can be a positive or a negative depending on your preference. The cream has a thick texture but it absorbs so well into my face. I have to agree that this cream makes my skin look nourished and I am very pleased with the results so far. It may just be my new favorite night face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After three weeks of using L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream I find I am quite pleased with the results so far. The texture of the cream is lovely, it is thick and buttery. The cream left my skin feeling dewy soft and well-hydrated. I think this is a wonderful night cream for dry skin but in the end it was too heavy for my combination complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I guess my skin just wasn't thirsty enough for this regimen. I used the day cream, night cream, and eye cream for 3 days, and my poor skin is suffering with clogged pores and angry blackheads. I have sensitive skin, so the fragrance in the product may have irritated my skin as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"smells and feels expensive!, i've been using the eye, day and night cream together and the result is amazing, this product is definitely worth it, right after applying my skin feels fresh and smells delicious, after a few hours feels hydrated at first I thought oily but if you touch it not at all, something that i really like [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this stuff is amazing! I'm currently using the day cream, night cream and eye cream and at first I wasn't very good at remembering to use the products. Once I started to notice the difference it was making in the clarity of my skin it was easier to remember because I can't wait for the appearance of my skin to be smoother and younger! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone interested in younger looking skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this night cream along with the eye renewal cream. I found it very refreshing and moisturizing. It left my skin feeling soft and renewed. It has a very soft cool scent that i personally liked! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just love the that the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect cell renewal Night cream is light and not heavy like other brand night creams. I can actually see a difference in my skin now that I have tried the Night cream along with using the day cream. The smell is wonderful sometimes I only wear the cream on my face so to smell the cream instead of perfume. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone with my dry skin with lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream has a pleasant scent to it and is quite thick. It was great for the time of year I was using it but I couldn't imagine putting it on during the summer. It's a pretty thick cream that didn't mix well with face sweat. Definitely left my skin feeling well moisturizers and looking fresh in the morning though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is by far my favorite night cream I've ever used. I love the scent and how well it absorbed into my skin. It was creamy but not oily. My face feels so soft after I use it. I even it used it a few times for day cream because I loved it so much. You only need to use a tiny bit of the cream, so it should last you quite awhile. It is well worth price!

"I woke up his morning and did a double take at my reflection. Gone are the dark circles and bags under my eyes. Say goodbye to the red, chapped cheeks that the desert winds batter. Say hello to a face that have smooth and supple skin, skin that is bright and refreshed, and eyes that sparkle. Thanks to L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream I laugh in the face of the dry desert heat and whipping winds. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love being able to wash my face at the end of a stressful day and put this night cream on my face. It just smooths my skin so much. And even found with the cold air makes my skin more sensitive but with this cream it helps the irritation go away and my skin is more firm. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked Loreal Age Perfect Night Cream. When you use it prior to bed as directed you wake up with your face feeling refreshed and reinvigorated. I highly recommend this product. Noticeable results after 2-3 weeks of use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am almost 50 years old and have normal to dry skin. Lately my skin has been more on the dry side and a little rough so I was very happy to receive this product. I've used this cream for about 3.5 weeks, every night, and I have been very pleased with the results. It has left my skin feeling baby soft and smooth. Even when I wasn't able to use it for a few days when I went out of town and left my make up bag, the effects lasted. I definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this night cream for a few weeks. It smells nicely and works well. I removed a star because it's more of a serum and feels think but dries on face right away so you don't need a bunch but I feel like I do. It's the middle of winter in the northeast while I'm using this and my skin has no dryness whatsoever and my skin feels smooth [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This night cream is good stuff! It's not too thick or greasy feeling, which is a big deal to me. I can put it on before bed and not feel like I'm oily and need to immediately wash my face in the morning. It doesn't break me out, either. After using it for about 3 weeks, I feel like my skintone is more even and my skin looks brighter and rejuvenated. The fine lines/wrinkles I'm starting to develop are still there, however. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recently starting using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream and I am in love with it. It moisturizes your face without feeling oily. My skin feels so dewy and soft that I don't even want to wash it off in the morning! The fine lines around my eyes and mouth are disappearing. I'm a fan for life! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal's Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream is my new favorite! After just a few weeks of nightly use, I wake up with brighter, smoother, more refreshed skin. And all the magic happens while I'm asleep. I honestly look forward to my nightly dose of facial cell renewing! It brings new meaning to the term ""beauty sleep"". [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great product. I have extremely sensitive skin and was hesitant at first to use this product. But, this product worked wonders. My skin started looking better right away. Very noticeable changes after a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product smells luxurious and has a really thick and absorbent texture. I noticed the difference right away. After the first night, I woke up with a visibly brighter complexion, more supple and bouncy skin with no dry patches. It left my skin with a sheen that feels like dead skin but washable with facewash. My skin felt so soft and healthy! I will definitely continue to use this cream, expecially in winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream is by far the best i have tried! You can feel it working after just one use. My skin felt firmer, healthier and not at all greasy. It didn't rub off or leave any marks on my pillowcase, which has been a problem with other brands products. I Would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It is a wonderful product, the night cream and day cream are so great, theymake my face so soft and smooth. The eye cream makes the skin around my eyes firmer and diminishes the dark circles under my eyes. I will continue to purchase all three items. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the L'Oreal Paris age perfect cell renewal night cream before going to bed every night, first thing I noticed was the creaminess of the product and easy application! Second, it had an amazing refreshing smell that I loved drifting off to sleep. My face felt so great in the morning and really felt moisturized! Definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I never realized how dry my skin was until I used this product. I truly loved how it felt on my face after being applied. It was not greasy or heavy which was a plus. I did have a breakout a few times after using this. It may have been due to using a scrub on my face beforehand. I really liked it and will continue to use it. One of the best I've used so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this night cream for almost a month now. I can truly say that I have seen a difference since using it. I am in my 30's with combination skin. My cheeks have been dry especially as the seasons change. The L'Oréal cell renewal night cream makes my skin feel hydrated. It doesn't feel oily and has a pleasant scent. I will definitely purchase this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used all kinds of night creams and this is definitely one of my favorites! I've been using it for about two weeks and my skin is so soft and moisturized! The only thing that I don't like is that there is a very slight gritty feel but it is insignificant and would not stop me from purchasing again. The Night Cream absorbs into my skin very quickly and there is absolutely no greasy feel. You won't regret buying this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I wish I would have known that along with the L'oreal Paris Age Perfect Renewal night cream I could have used the L'oreal Paris Age Perfect Renewal Day cream as a combination. I am just in love with this product, I cant believe how smooth and firm my skin has become. Even my complexion has evened out, I am amazed at the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like Loreal Age Perfect night cream. I have been applying each evening after I wash my face before bed. I like that this cream is light and not greasy feeling. It absorbs quickly and my face still feels clean after I put it on. It does not make my face feel tight or tingly, a big plus in my opinion. It makes my skin feel really soft, and my skin still fells hydrated when I wake up in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is so amazing.After a long day it is so great to be able to wash my face and use this.It completely replenished my skin without drying it out.It left my skin feeling wonderful.i love this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used it for 2 weeks. It worked well as a moisturizer and didn't leave my skin feeling greasy. I noticed a difference in my skins overall look and feel after daily use. My skin seemed healthier and I looked less tired. I do wish it came in a squeezeable tube or pump style bottle to make application easier. This product would be good for someone looking for an affordable product that lives up to its promises. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The older we get the more we loose moisture. This night cream is wonderful. Its thicker then all others I have tried and you only need a dab. I put dots all over my face because it gets absorbed so quickly , otherwise it would get into just one area. The results have been terrific, my skin in not chapped or dry in the morning. I even put it on my lips. Smells terrific as well Very nice product, and much better then the more expensive ones out in the market. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think it gets the skin looking supple and a bit younger looking, but it is too perfumey for me. I can do without the fragrance. Also, looks wax like in the jar like a pomade so was not really wanting to put in on my face at first. Did though and went on okay, but I would had wished a little bit more creamy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this night Cream for almost two weeks now. I use it after I wash my face at night and then apply it. My face is normally a combination of dry and oily. I've noticed that my skin is very hydrated and moisturized all over. When I wake up in the morning where before my skin would just be blah and dry, it is now smooth and soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"works well. cream (so not a lotion) but not greasy. moisturizes your skin throughout the night and you wake up w/ supple skin. i would prefer something without a fragrance, however, the fragrance was not too over powering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all the small of this cream is so omg is the best ever...I've been looking actively for a night cream that didn't make my face feel overly greasy and I have found it in this night cream, the dry spots i had are now a thing of the past. I really do love the smell of it..even the BF liked it.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This has a great consistency for a night cream. It is thicker and feels good on. I wake up with my skin soft. The scent is also not as heavy as the day cream which is nice. I would definitely purchase in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Just before I close my eyes for the day I put on L'oreal Night Cream. It feels so fresh clean and soft. Feels like I am doing something good for my skin. In the morning my skins looks great. After a few weeks my skin is looking more vibrant and smooth. This is my new night time ritual. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A little thicker than I would have thought. Had to message my face really good. Using it with the other products was satisfying . My skin feels smoother and softer. I have a dry skin especially during winter time and cream is helping a lot. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This smells so sweet, like a tropical spa treatment. It even tastes sweet, I accidentally licked the side of my mouth right after applying. It's so thick, like a butter, but absorbs quickly. It leaves my skin feeling soft. I haven't been using a night cream steadily, but I'm considering continuing to use this. I've been using it for 2 weeks and the jar still has plenty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this product for almost 4 weeks and have seen a dramatic improvement in my skin. When I wake up my skin feels soft and supple. It looks refreshed and firmer with a healthy glow. Definitely a permanent part of my skin regimen!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream! After 3 weeks I saw a visible difference. The lines on my upper lip are less noticeable and my face has a dewey, healthy glow! I have very sensitive skin and had no problems with this product. Thank-You L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had high hopes for this night cream. But after a week use, my face got broken out and felt a bit unclean. I do have combination skin so that could be part of it! I also would like to say that it has a strong scent that I would wake up smelling randomly! Nothing major but if someone is sensitive to scents, this product is not for you. I discontinued use after the week of using it and my skin cleared right back up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked it as a moisturizer, this works great for me and my skin. You don't need to use a lot, a little bit and and it goes smoothly on. I like it because the next morning your skin is feeling great and relaxed like after a spa Day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Absolutely Love this L'Oréal night cream. It has made a great difference in my skin and dealing with the elements of the cold winter weather and moving to a different part of the country. Thank you, finally I'm looking forward to getting up and pretty myself for the day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think it felt great on my skin and restore Resilience, Radiance, Vitality, Stimulates surface skin renewal, creamy texture comforts, nourishes skin. I didn't felt any discomofort or stinging in the eyearea and mostly I have really sensetive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the L'Oreal night cream for about 2 weeks now. I love the consistency of it and the smell. The product I was using prior did not have a separate day/night cream. I really like that L'Oreal age perfect has a day & night cream. I have some rough/dry areas around my mouth and lower cheeks. I have already noticed that these problem areas are improving. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recently started using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream. It has a very minimal scent, no sticky residue, no greasy feeling and it makes me look and feel great. I am very happy with the results so far and while I've been only using it a short time, people HAVE noticed. I have been asked if i have been going to a spa or getting anti aging treatments or work done on my face. I'm very proud to state it is due to L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Generally not a cream moisturizer person, I go for gel or very light moisturizers, because of my sensitive skin. It did not break me out which i was afraid of, but was a little heavy, but in my opinion a lot of night creams are. But I will not be repurchasing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"One night after using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal I was loving the feel of my face. It was so soft and smooth I couldn't wait to tell my two sisters. But I waited a week so they could really see the difference, which they did. Revitalizing the cells of my face sure does make me sleep a lot happier now!

"This product is something I will definitely add to my nighttime beauty ritual. It is non-greasy yet effectively moisturing; there is no oily residue in my pillow in the morning, just a refreshING look in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is a great find. The packaging is beautiful and very pratical. The smell and consistency is perfect and the products claims and uses are clearly labeled. I would defintely try this product for longterm use to see the long term affects. The smell isn't very overwheling and the moisture it provides when waking up is perfect, not too oily. Overall its a great product and I would recommend it to others if they were looking for a night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a fan of L'Oreal products so I was excited to try this product. I found it to be a soft, perfectly thick and rich enough to help my skin without being greasy. I have used it for a couple weeks and love the way my skin feels. A great moisturizer that can be used without the worry of skin break outs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved this product! My skin became so much softer and brighter looking. My fine lines began to disappear and were less noticeable. It was very easy to apply and rubbed in easily. I have very sensitive skin and many products feel like they are burning my skin. This did not happen with any of these products. I definitely recommend these products to anyone who wants to help rejuvenate their skin care. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This night cream felt nice, very thick and moisturizing, especially during these dry winter months. I'm not sure how long it takes to notice the effects, so in retrospect I could have taken a ""before"" photo to document changes along the way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"With all due respect to Loreal, this product was not a match for my skin type. Since having very sensitive skin, it caused severe breakouts and burning. Also very greasy to me. Nothing against Loreal products as I do purchase them, but just not this specific product as I do have very sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm giving this product a 5 stars just because I love the day cream but can't tell which one is helping my face the most or if their working together so I stopped the day cream 2 days ago and will test the night cream for a week or so to see how well it is working I see wonderful results already [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was a great night cream. It was very thick and really helped with my super dry skin. I felt like after using it consistently for several weeks my skin felt more consistently moist. The product does have a scent and while it's not unpleasant, it is a bit strong. The packaging is also so similar to the day cream that I have to read the label to make sure I grabbed the correct one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream for a couple weeks now. I use it every night right after I wash my face. It goes on smooth and absorbs into the skin well. Its a nice light non oily cream. When I wake up in the morning, my face feels refeshed and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream is great. For a night Cream it had a nice light scent and a rich, creamy, texture. I would apply it before bed and it would soak in as I slept and it was wonderful. I wouldn't stick to my bedding and it would gently soak in to my skin making it plumb and supple. It lasts forever and made my skin feel so good. I loved waking up in cold weather not having dried out skin. This is amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had never put on any kind of cream at night before this was a first for me. I started by washing my face then applied as directed. It seems to help keep my skin soft and almost gives it a little color [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this cream! Ater a week of use my skin feels so much softer to the touch and the lines appear smoother. It is light and quickly absorbed and has a light very pleasant scent. Also it is very concentrated and a little goes a long way. The search is over this is the night cream for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product every night for the last 3 weeks. I have noticed a huge improvement in my skin. It was looking rather dull and dry before using this Perfect Cell line. Now my skin is much more vibrant and luminous. It has a little heavier feeling on the skin since it is a night cream, I find a little of this goes a long way. This is a fantastic skin care line which I will be using for quite some time as I have really enjoyed the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think before purchasing this product I wasn't too know how it compares to others on the market, does it stand out against the others, how is the value compared to others? I have found this product to be very beneficial to my aging skin, I have sensitive skin and this product worked great for me. I noticed a difference after using the product for a very short time, great results, skin looked better, younger which makes me feel better [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this cream for about 2 weeks and I love it. I am 55 years young and I have dry, sensitive skin. I also have some wrinkles around my mouth and eyes. I used this at night before bed, after having used the day cream also. I had no negative interaction at all. The cream goes on easily and has a pleasant smell. My skin definitely looks smoother and I believe an age spot on my check has noticeably faded. I will continue using this...I'm a big fan! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream for 3 weeks I am thrilled with how soft and rejuvenated my skin feels! The cream is thick and has a lovely soft floral scent. My skin feels hydrated and almost plump. I have not noticed any of my wrinkles disappearing just yet, but my skin feels so good I will continue to use this product for a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Out of the 3 products I tried, this was by far my least favorite. Understandably this is a night cream but it's a little too heavy for me. It made my skin feel greasy and left me feeling like I need to wash my face again. I did cut back the use to once/twice a week and that seemed to help. Everyday use wouldn't be something I would use on combo skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So I've been using this product along with the Day cream & eye cream daily for over 2 weeks. I feel like my face looks brighter already! The packaging is so rich and regal looking and the cream is packed to the brim! It's dense so a little goes a long way! Once you smooth it in, it's weightless and instantly makes your skin soft and hydrated. I am in my early 30s and had been wanting to start a anti aging skin regime and I think this line from L'Oréal is exactly what I've been wanting! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I truly liked this skin. Waking up to oily areas on my skin was a problem in the past so at first I was worried about applying a night cream. I must say my skin wasn't oily at all an actually gave me the glowing look in the morning. My skin appeared to be radiant. It was soft and hydrated. This has a pleasant scent I didn't need to use a lot of the product. I definitely would recommend to help with signs of aging. My skin felt renewed overnight! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've only been a using this night cream for 3 weeks now but it's a winner!! It glides on easily and has a pleasant, light scent. It is a little greasy but your putting it on to sleep in, so who cares. I take my makeup off and wash my face with my usual products and then apply a small amount of this night cream to my face and neck and when I wake up the cream is completely absorbed and my skin feels silky smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried many night creams most of them have chemicals in them that my face can't handle. I have used this cream nightly to see if it would break my skin out and to my surprise it has not done that. I am so happy that my face feels wonderful when I awake. #lorealnightcream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I expected my face to feel refreshed and moisturizer when I woke up, but it didn't. It felt moisturized when I put it on before I went to bed, but other than that I can't say this is something I would buy in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I actually like this cream. It's not heavy and I'll still wake up with my skin feeling soft. I'm only on my first jar but I think this will be a repeat buy. I think it's better than using a regular moisturizer at night [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for close to three weeks now. It seems to work well! I have to use it longer to really see but so far I do see the start of a change. My skin has more of a glow. Looking forward to seeing what happens as I continue using! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got a chance to use the Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial night Cream. I don't feel like it left me moisturized. It is a light creme that feels like cashmere for the skin. Overall it was a great product that I enjoyed using. Great to use after a long day and a nice face wash. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Each night I used this, my face felt cool, refreshed and soft. However, I woke up every morning with a pimple... A new one each day! At first I thought maybe my skin was just adjusting to a new product, but it never stopped. Acne at 37 is not something I'm interested in so I won't be using this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Product smells nice and is thick like most night creams. After the first night, I woke up with a visibly brighter complexion, more supple and bouncy skin with no dry patches.This product totally and immediately reversed the issues I was having! My skin re hydrated, plumped up, and my skin felt so much softer, smoother and dewy.It's definitely gonna be my new go-to night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Nice cream. I liked how thick and smooth it was. I also appreciated the fact that it didn't have much of a smell so I didn't go to bed smelling something weird. It didn't feel super greasy like some lotions either which I really appreciated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how this makes my face feel like its really hydrated . It does have a greasy feel tho. Ever since i been using this tho my make up is easier to apply in the morning. So it does hydrate your skin really well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Again the Night Cream was just way to strong scented for me! My husband didn't even want to kiss me at night after I put it on. The Cell Renewal technology wasn't noticeable enough for me to justify using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After using this just one time I was so surprised how my face felt. It made me want to continue its use to see how much it would actually make a difference to how I look. It is fantastic. I love how alive my skin looks. It is not pasty looking anymore. It feels so soft and smooth like a baby's behind. I love it. I wll certainly buy it when this container is empty!!!!

"This night cream is really growing on me. I like it more every time I use it. It's smooth, thick, and not greasy. I'm a nurse, and exhausted after a shift. Putting the night cream on after work is like a little treat for my tired skin. I definitely see a decrease in my tiny facial lines! I will continue to use this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Really love the loreal night Cream, I have purchased many Creams before an some are expansive and didn't make my face as smooth and soft like this one. I will make the switch to this one and there line of face products. Thank you for giving me a new product that positive results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried this product along with the day and eye creams. I love how thick this moisturizer is makes it fell like it goes deep into your skins surface. My face looks and feels great and all I had to do is rub it in. Easy to do and not to much to think about. Worth a try!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I normally don't use night creams. I figured since the Eye and Day Creams worked so well, I would try this too. Lightweight, almost melts into your skin. Not chemical smelling. Using this alone or with the set, it won't let you down. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using night cream and eye cream for 2 weeks. I do notice a difference in that my skin feels smoother. I have suffered from dark circles and bag under my eyes forever, haven't really seen a difference with eye cream. Once I stopped using day cream my skin was not as irritated. Have not had any breakouts with night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the cream for a week. My face was smoother, I'll give it that. Unfortunately that's where the good ended for me. After applying my face felt almost as if there was a mask of product that just wouldn't absorb. I thought maybe I was applying too much so I reduced the amount I used. It didn't help. It still felt heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's a bonus when my husband notices results, and he loves this night cream just as much as I do! The fragrance is soft and beautiful, and my skin is silky, not oily, every morning. There's no residue, and it doesn't clog pores. As my hubby says, it's just lovely! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As I have continued use this product, I am finding that my face is no longer as dry as the sahara desert! the rest of my body is however!!! I also like how small of an amount I need to use to get good coverage, that means this bottle will last forever!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Eye Renewal is my favorite eye cream I've tried thus far! It was light, and didn't burn my eyes or make them water, like previous creams I've tried. I noticed a positive change in the under eye area in a Lil over a week. Thanks L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
In the winter I have severely dry skin between my brows. Since using the Loreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream this has not been an issue this winter. I love this cream! It makes me look great in the morning! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Does this cream work? I must admit... YES! it does! I feel like my face has been replace with new skin! After using this for almost a month, my skin feels so nice. I've noticed less wrinkling around my eyes and tightening around my temples. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I usual do not use night cream due to being so heavy but the L""Oreal Paris night cream is so light weight and smooth I love applying every night! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The night cream is very light, feels great on the skin. Has a very light pleasant smell, not overpowering. Doesn't feel heavy or greasy, absorbs quickly so you can go to bed knowing it's not going to get all over the pillow. My skin felt refreshed and smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought the L'Oreal Paris Night Cream was very Moisturizing! It is very creamy and smells fantastic! It is a little greasy for me, considering my oily skin. I did use it on the back of my hands and it hydrated to well. I will continue to use the night cream for a while longer to see if my face adjust to the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think I really like this product. I have been using for almost 3 weeks and my skin feels and looks different in a good way. I am considering continue using this product. My skin seems to have adjusted to the moisturizer since it is no longer breaking out. I particularly like that the night cream is more creamy. I feel that even when I rub against my pillow the cream stays on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night cream for a couple weeks now and while I haven't noticed a HUGE difference I have noticed that my face doesn't seem to be as puffy in the morning when I wake up. I have super oily skin and this product does seemed to have calmed that down just a tad which, for me, any help in that area is amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I would reccomend this night cream. It absorbs easily and doesn't feel greasy. The night cream also has a light fragrance which is very pleasant. I don't use a night cream, but if you do I would reccomend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I usually don't like to try different products on my face. I have, however, tried a few different night creams and this one has been my favorite so far! It's a little thick but goes on smooth and I'd like to believe I'm seeing results already. The photo of my hand is to show the effects of the eye cream which is also absolutely amazing!

"I enjoyed talking about L'Oréal Night Cream with my family & friends during the holidays. I had been using it for a couple of weeks already, & my face felt more supple and smooth! Some of my old high school friends call & let me know they were going to try the ""Night Cream"",we had fun talking about what we had tried back in the 1950's! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After a few weeks of using this product I have seen results. My skin is less irritated doesn't look as red as it used too and it feel smooth. This product is doing what is intended to I am comfortable going out without any makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"What I can say about L'Oreal age perfection cell renewal night cream is that it is very heavy and has a very strong Smell. Not a bad smell but a bit overwhelming for bedtime! I did not notice any change in my facial skin other than occasional pimples, which I normally do not get. I don't know if it is the day Cream or the night Cream because I used them both. Overall, I must say that I would not buy any of the Loriael facial products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product and how it has made my skin feel. It feels a lot softer to me, my skin is pretty sensitive too with break outs and burning of my skin when I try products but this didn't do any of that. I would like to try the serum it says to put on before the age perfect night cream I'm sure my skin would feel even better. I've suggested to people to try my mom and aunt have already added to their list to buy. Thumbs up for this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream and it is truly wonderful! I am 53 years old with dull, and dry skin, but my skin is showing great results on making my skin look smoother, moist, and glowing. I love the way it goes glides on my face and neck, and love that I can apply it at night before I go to bed and it is not greasy at all. I recommend this cream for women that want to improve their skin texture and dullness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The creams were nice and smooth. Unfortunately none of the creams were suited for my skin. It left an oily film on my skin. Although I would have liked for my skin to like the creams because one bottle would last a long time and my current cream finishes too quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream and not only was I thrilled by how soft and silky it made my skin feel, but also how bright and youthful it made my skin look in the morning! It has an almost matte feeling once it is fully absorbed so it leaves my skin feeling clean before I go to bed. This is definitely a great product that makes it easy to invest in the health and appearance of my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked how my face felt after I would wake up in the morning. It made my face feel soft and smooth. I was happy using this product. The was a little difference after a week of using this product. My face felt refreshed. I would recommended this product. It worked well for me. If you looking for a fresh and clean feeling face this product is for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First thing, this cream smells amazing. I apply this before I get into the bed at night and I wake feeling refreshed. I can actually see the results in the mirror after using for only 3 weeks. It rubs on so smooth. It is light and refreshing. If you want have younger looking skin, I highly recommend these Loreal face products!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the night cream as it doesn't leave my face oily. Having oily skin and finding a night cream that doesn't make it worse is hard but I think they perfected that! My skin used to feel very dry after washing it and my skin feel tight and like it was being pulled on but yet oily on the forehead area but since using cell renewal night cream I've not had my of those problems. This is a great product to add to your nightly skin care routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think these products are great, I started seeing a difference after a few days, after about a week you could really notice that the dark circles under my eyes were going away. then one day not to long ago my 9 year old grandson told me I looked beautiful with my make up on, I had to laugh at the look on his face when I told him I was not wearing any. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is so great for working at night and not even thinking about it. The bottle is small and compact and easy to store. The night cream seems to last a long time and goes on super smooth without using too much. It did make me break out a little, but I noticed my face was a little brighter and less dry. I did use the day and night cream together so I think together they both helped my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"most creams that I have used are so thick that when I'm putting them on I feel like I am stretching my skin out just trying to put it on, but not with this cream. It goes on smooth & smells good too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the night cream and I think it's okay. I didn't like the greasy feel at night while sleeping. It definitely smells wonderful and goes on pretty smooth. It's probably not something that I will use everyday but it's not a bad product. Just not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was surprised how rich feeling and thick this cream was when I first opened it. It feels very luxurious when I put it on and absorbs quickly. I feel like it's really nourishing and repairing my skin's dryness while I sleep. I feel like my skin is firmer after using it for a relatively short period of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the night cream for 3 weeks and have noticed a big difference in my skin. My skin fills firmer and I have a much healthier glow. I definitely recommend this product and will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the night cream is a good buy. It has a light soft scent. It goes on well and absorbs quickly. A little goes a long way. I like the way it makes my skin feel, dewy and nourished. My skin is less dry and looks younger, even after just a few applications. It feels luxurious. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream is a rich creamy nighttime moisturizer that blends easily into my skin. My skin was smoother and softer in morning. Although I found definite moisturizing benefits in the Renewal Night Cream I prefer nighttime products that contain ingredients that multi task such as help reduce the look of age spots, help even out tone and help laugh lines. As a moisturizer the cream was good but I was not overly impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product because I have the beginning of crow's feet (wrinkles in corners of eyes) and some wrinkles between eyes other than that my skin is pretty good so I used this as directed for 3 weeks unfortunately no changes in appearance wrinkles did not diminish skin did not take on a healthier glow in fact my face has broken out with tiny pimples in some areas that were clear before use so for me it's a no. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The night Cream takes some getting used to. It feels like wax on your skin and is hard to get out of the eye brows. However my skin was gotten smoother and I haven't had any breakouts . Overall I am pleasantly surprised by the result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I gave this preparation four stars as it is more like dry butter in consistency than the other two products. It is smooth enough but stiff to handle. It does seem to smooth and nourish the face, and disappears into the skin quickly, but was not my favorite to touch and use, as the eye and day cream were. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewel Night Cream. It left my skin feeling nourished. I had a few dry sections on my face that no longet exist. My skin is smooth. I used the cream every other night. Using it every night was to much, which caused my skin to become really oily. I would recommend this to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the smell of this product and how easily it glides on my skin. It does not leave my skin feeling greasy at all. A small amount goes a long way. The day cream ended up breaking out my sensitive skin. However, the night cream did not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've worked many years in the cosmetic industry, and I have to say this is just as good, if not even better than the ""high end"" products that are out there. It has a very nice fragrance that is not over powering, extremely silky smooth finish without the greasy feeling. I absolutely am in love! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really loved the cell renewal night cream. I liked how clean and smooth my skin felt after I used it. I could actually tell a difference in my skin texture. It was very refreshing. I'm definitely going to keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream (1.7 oz) for close to a month and the results are amazing! My skin is younger looking and I literally glow! I struggled with occasional dry patches but since using this product my facial skin has been moisturized like it has never experienced before! This is one facial regime that I actually enjoy doing before going to bed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product! My skin looks and feels more youthful, I've seen a reduction in fine lines and my overall skin tone has evened out. No more blotchy skin for me. This is my new nighttime cream. Thanks L'Oreal for an awesome product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It was good experience with L'Oréal renewal cream. I always like to experiment different age creams. Results always vary. And it's not because of their price. This time I tried age night cream and was very satisfied. My face was fresh in the morning like after good weekends. My skin looked very rested and was soft, it seemed like I never had wrinkles before. Hope that everybody tried it had the same result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This renewal night cream leaves my skin feeling soft and healthy and revitalized. As with any facial cream or moisturizer, I was worried that this might clog my pores resulting in blemishes and to my delight it did not do this at all even though it is nice and rich. Aside from how fresh it makes my skin look and feel, my favorite thing about this night cream is the delightful scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this product. I love everything about it. I have always had to be very careful what to use on my face, as I always had some sort of reaction. No problems at all with this. I love the way it feels, smells and works on my face. After using for a few weeks, I can actually tell that it is working. Small lines have disappeared and my skin is soft and smooth. I definitely recommend this product. I know that I will buying it in the future. Thank you L'Oreal!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product seemed a bit heavy or thick. I thought wow this is really going to get to my wrinkles, but it didn't do any better than the product I was using before. I don't think I'd pay more for this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was looking forward to trying the night cream hoping it would moisturize and renew my skin, but alas, it did not. It claims that one can see instant results in 1 month, but that didn't happen for me. I did like the texture and the smell was pleasant. I'm disappointed that it didn't work for me but maybe it would work for others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I loved the luxurious feel of this cream. It was a little thick to put around the eyes, but I'd recommend the eye cream of the same product line for that. This cream felt nourishing without being too heavy, I felt I was doing something very healthy for my skin. I didn't notice an improvement in skin texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the softness of my skin after using this night cream. It was not too heavy on my skin, but felt very soothing. The night cream also did make my laugh line and eye wrinkles seem less noticeable. I will continue using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a very moisturizing night cream, with a dense but easily spreadable texture. I wish it came in an unscented version, as the fragrance was too much for my skin. I also wish this was in a pump and not in a jar. For someone very dry and not sensitive, this is probably a great night cream, just not for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using L'Oreal Paris Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream for just over 2 weeks. It's been great with my sensitive skin - no rash or break-outs! I can't believe that my skin is so well hydrated and soft when I wake up - the moisturizer lasts all night! My skin has been softer, smoother, hydrated, and, I believe, fewer fine lines! 54 isn't so bad, thanks to L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
In the morning when I go to wash my face I noticed that my face looked fresh and bright after washing it. The night cream definitely did what is suppose to do while sleeping. It is very thick so you have to rub it in very well. The scent was nice and it absorbed quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wow! One would think you'd know about skin creams! This night cream not only smells good it's not greasy, feels soft on the skin and you wake up looking refreshed. Use with the day cream. Wrinkles, soft lines, brighter complexion, completely refreshed. A definite must have! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a nice moisturizer for normal to dry skin, wouldn't recommend it for combination to oily skin that I have, it made my pores lager and that's a no no! But it was good for my décolletage area, it helped with some vertical wrinkles that started developing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is so much smoother and softer since using this product! I love all products that I have tried! The eye cream, the day cream and the night cream. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and everyone looking for smoother, softer and healthier looking skin. I love th way my makeup looks. I have found I need less foundation and the coverage is flawless. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I think L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream is a great product. It leaves my skin feeling nicely moisturized without feeling greasy. It also has a nice light scent. The best part of this product is the results. My skin feels and looks more supple. I did not notice immediate results as stated on the box, but the long term results are great. I would recommend it to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this night cream. The first night I tried the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream, I thought ""this is way too thick"". Boy, was I surprised when it absorbed quickly and was not greasy. I love the feel and my skin is soft and smooth. The fragrance is also very nice and light. I will definitely use this again. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have hesitated to try a night cream because I did not want to feel greasy all night. I see the white mask on others and think NOT ME. This Cream is light but really keeps my face feeling moist and relaxed all night. No more waking with a tight face. I can see the difference in my skins elasticity and it feels great. I am sooo happy I took a chance!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Due to me not washing my face at night on a constant basis, I wasn't able to fully enjoy the product. It has a delightful smell that is refreshing when applied. The cream is lightweight and rubs in very easily. I only applied a small amount (a small pea size amount) on my checks, forehead, and chin which provided enough coverage for my face. I have very sensitive skin. However, I did not break out from using it. It is a great cream to use before going to bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this faithfully since receiving it, along with the day cream and eye cream. This is a wonderful night cream - one of the best I've used, and I've used many high-end products. It has added moisture without making my skin oilier. it is non irritating. I find my skin has plumped up since using it which diminishes the look of lines and wrinkles. I really like this product and will recommend it to friends and family! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this cream is silky and smooth when it goes on the skin, it gives the skin moisture without the oiliness of other night creams. Still waiting a few more days to see if it makes a bigger improvement on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a wonderful night cream. It smells very nice, left my skin nice and smooth the next day, and I could tell a real difference after a couple weeks. I've never tried face products like this before, but I think I will continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to try this product, as the other products in this line are great. Unforunately, I was disappointed. Being night cream, you would think it would be more moisturizing than the day cream; not so. I felt this product had a dry, almost sticky feel during application. And it had a strong perfume-like smell. Nothing terrible, just too much scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the loreal night cream! Its Very simple to apply, leaves your skin feeling moisturized but not greasy at all, and smells amazing! My complexion changed for the better with this product and i will continue to use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was not impressed with this night cream at all. First of all, it does not go on very smooth at all. It is very thick and hard to blend into skin. Second, for some reason it tended to break me out along the outer edges of my face so I have stopped using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream was great at keeping my skin nourished at night but never had a problem with it getting to oily. I would use it on my neck as well and noticed a difference in the tightness of my skin. I will continue to use it on a daily basis. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is a great night cream. It's a thick cream you apply it by using small circular motions on your face and neck. It's by L'Oreal so you know it's a good product. The smell is wonderful. I've been using it for a short period of time but I already see a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the L'Oreal Night Cream is amazing! I love the way it makes my face feel as soon as I put it on. It smells great. I have been using for at least 2 weeks and I can already see changes in my skin. It looks healthier and not as dull. The wrinkles seem to be getting smaller as well. I'm loving it and I will definitely be buying as soon as mine runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've never really tried an overnight cream before. I'm now a total convert!! It only takes an extra minute before bed every night, but the payoff has been huge! I seriously look like I've never missed a minute of sleep in my life. My skin has a gorgeous glow straight out of bed every morning. I will never go without a night cream again!

"This was a bit more sticky on my skin than I anticipated. It did however, deliver a lot of over night hydration to my face. I will continue to use a an over night moisturizer, as I was my face in the morning anyways. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
First I love that is only a Night and Morning Cream. I'm a busy Mom and I don't have a lot of time on my hands. I also like that not only did I see results after a week you feel firm right away. I also liked that VERY faint smell. I don't like heavy perfumes. Its not too thick not to thin. The Jar will last a really long time as well. I didn't need to use a lot to cover my entire neck and face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin was dying for hydration that wasn't greasy or heavy. The night cream went on almost like whipped Butter but no greasy remnants. My face felt moist and supple. The texture of my skin has improved and I hardly look my 45 years... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the product OK, but it was a little to heavy for my skin. I ended up using the day cream for day and night. It did reduce the fine lines of aging and I noticed a marked difference in the texture of my skin after two weeks of use. The eye cream was good too and I definitely noticed a difference in the lines around the eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Every morning since using this product, I can wake up in the mornings and actually see the difference in my skin! The little lines are becoming less noticable and my skin is so much smoother! My mother asked what I was using and went out and bought this product the same day! Amazing product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream is much thicker than the day cream but still goes a long way. I can't tell immediate effects but I'd say the long run is what matters. With that said I'd be willing to pay a little extra as those things are what matters to me. The cream is not greasy and has a nice smell. The jar is heavy and should be able to be reused by a crafter for something. I recommend this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was very excited to try the L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream. And after trying it I couldn't have been more pleased! It went on very smoothly and left my skin feeling soft. It was not at all greasy. And it also has a sunscreen which is a real bonus. I was very happy to be introduced to this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As a moisturizer, this works great. You don't have to use a lot and it goes on with no mess. My complaint is the fragrance. It's not an unpleasant fragrance, but a little too strong for my liking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Tje age perfect Cell Renewal Night cream has an amazing scent that even my husband commented on. It is thicker than the day cream which is to be expected for any night cream. After a week of use I could feel the difference in my skin from the texture to firmness. I absolutely love this night cream and will not be going back to my old brand. Way to go loreal you nailed this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I am in my early 30's with combination skin and a history of acne. L'Oreal's night cream was easy to put on and absorbed easily. It has a light flowery fragrance. It is a bit thick. So, while it's okay for wintertime or in air conditioned rooms, I wouldn't recommend it for warmer situations. While it is a good moisturizer, I haven't noticed any difference in my skin compared to my usual lotions. I have been using it for about 2 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Everymorning when I wake up my face feels and looks amazing since I started using this product. I apply it before bed every night. It goes on silky smooth and you only need a little bit. It smells amazing too! I would deffinitly reccomend this product to family and fiends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I noticed a change immediately using the eye cream . I also love the day and nite cream . It has done wonders to my skin. It feels good on my face and neck . No greasy heavy feeling . I have told my friends about this. Definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think L'Oreal Night Cream is a wonderful product. I have been using the cream for 2 weeks and I have noticed fine lines diminished and pores seem to be smaller. In addition, I have noticed softer and more hydrated skin. I love this product.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is wonderful! It smells nice and smooths on so nicely. My skin is soft and glowing. I have oily skin so when I apply this product on my face, it doesn't feel greasy at all. In the morning, my skins looks great and moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the feel of the night cream on my face before and after sleep, but I find it leaves my T-zone somewhat oily. This is fine in winter when my skin is drier, but I don't know how it would perform on my skin in summer months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I expected to see a little bit more results from the night renewal cream. After using it for almost 2 weeks straight I can't really see a big difference. It's soft, not greasy and smells great but just didn't seem different or better than other night creams. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this the first night I got it. The smell gave me a headache and in combination with the eye cream, I smelled like an 70 year old with toi much perfume on. It made it hard to go to sleep. The next day I could scrap the lotion off my skin still so i either didnt rub it in enough or it never absorbed. I honestly have zero desire to find out if it works by the smell alone.

I've tried a ton of these types of products but never liked one as much as this one!you only need a small amount to cover your entire face and neck!my face felt so moisturized!i would recommend this product to all my friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that this night cream is quite strong smelling for something I am going to sleep in. Like the day cream it has a strong scent, I can handle it during the day but at night it tended to bother me much more. I loved how smooth the application was though and it was absorbed quickly so not sticky/wet pillowcases! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Tried this night cream for the past few weeks and already noticed a difference! Not greasy and soaks in quickly. Would love an unscented version as I am very sensitive to scents and perfume but this may not be an issue for most people [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that to a product is perfect for anyone who needs moisturized skin on their face. I loved this product. My face felt rejuvenated and full of the nourishment that it has been lacking. I would recommend this product to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was a little concerned when I first started using the night cream because it is very thick and heavy feeling. I have oily skin so I have a tendency to breakout with heavy creams. But I have been pleasantly surprised. No breakouts and I can see a positive change in the firmness of my skin. It also has a really nice fragrance. I would definitely recommend this product for older woman concerned about having firmer looking skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the age perfect cell renewal night cream leaves my face soft even after I wake up the next morning my face is still soft. I will continue to use this product in the future love the way it makes my face feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"A night cream is so important for a dry and itching skin like mine. This night cream is awesome: it spreads easily , so I only have to use a tiny bit ( so it will last longer), it is not greasy, and makes my skin smooth and soft! This cream compliments very well the day cream from the same line! The only thing that I don't like is that the fragrance is a little bit too strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have sensitive combination skin. I would wash my face and apply the cream nightly. The cream itself is thick and once applied feels very heavy. I initially thought it would just absorb into my skin and hydrate it well. When I would wake in the morning, my face just felt very oily. For me, the night cream is just too heavy and only adds to oils in all the wrong places. Additionally, the scent is very perfumey. It was off-putting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Paris products are excellent! My facial skin was smoother and softer, and my neck became smoother. I love what this product has done for my neck. So smooth! The eye creme is wonderful. My skin looks better and feels softer. And I love the way the skin on my neck feels now. So soft, and it was ""lizard skin"". Yuk! Yeah, it Was! Not anymore! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received all 3 products at the same time. The Night Cream is my favorite -you can apply as much Cream as you want and it does not feel padded. It's light on the face and smells wonderful. This is the only product I apply to my neck and the uglylines is slowly going away. I have only used this for 3 weeks and it is working better than expected. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product smells fantastic. It is easy to apply and a little goes a long way. If there is one thing I could be critical on is that it felt a bit oily for me. This could have just been me. The results were fast and my skin feels fantastic. I am a customer for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for about two weeks and have noticed changes. My face seems much shinier and not so dull. It seems to look younger as well. Not sure if it was only this product or the combination that I have been using. I have been using the L'Oreal Day Crème and Night Crème and the renewal eye cream. Either way my face looks great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream was very thick and moisturizing which was great. It was also heavy feeling though which for me was a negative. I didn't like that it had a slight scent; I prefer moisturizing creams to be unscented. My skin was already dry, and it burned my skin. I didn't notice an immediate change in the appearance of my skin other than it not being dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product added a lot of moisture to my face when using it at night. It is thick and creamy but did not make my skin feel greasy. As far as giving my skin a more youthful look, I could not tell whether it was working. I would recommend it for the moisture it provided [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
That this is a great product. In the short time I have been using it I really feel like it has made a difference. I have told friends about it and have had people ask me if I was doing anything different [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I don't usually use night creme but I decided to try it & see if it improved my skin care regimen. Was I surprised. My skin feels & looks fantastic. Fine lines are diminishing. No longer does my skin look tired & worn. Looks radiant & bright. I'm so pleased with it. My skin hasn't looked so good in a long time [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I enjoyed the night cream a little more than the day cream simply because of the lower fragrance in the product. I have sensitive skin and can have bad reactions to fragrances but this product worked really well with my skin. I noticed that in the morning I didn't feel like my skin was thirsting for moisture and wasn't oily like with other products. I highly enjoy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that L'Oréal's Age Perfect Cell Renew Night Cream is a great product. I used it last night for the second time. It really is gives my skin a glow. It has a light texture and I do not have to use very much of it. It is not sticky and heavy on my skin. I like the scent of the cream because it does not smell medicated. I would recommend this product to my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The consistency of this product is buttery soft. It glides on my face and it easy to apply. It doesn't feel greasy or oily. The smell is subtle and doesn't bother my nose. While some fragrances bother me in skincare products - this is not one of them. I recommend wearing this at night! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream does a nice job of skin repair as I sleep. The thicker formula (from the Day Renewal cream) glides smoothly over my skin. It is unfragranced, which I always enjoy. I'm on my way to fresher, more vibrant skin! (Photo at two weeks of use) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was given the opportunity to try this product as well. Again, it was packaged nicely. Love the fragrance. I have dehydrated skin due to the cold weather, this night cream has really worked well for my skin...and a little goes a long way. My face is much smoother and nourished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I started using the L'Oreal Paris age perfect and cell bring all night cream. I can tell a difference my face feels like it's lifting my eyes are great they don't look so puffy in the morning my skin is so soft and I didn't have the softest skin before. I'm not one to take a little stops and protecting my skin but with using this product has made me change my mind this is one thing I have done for the last 10 days on regular basis. I think everybody should try it to [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am not completely satisfied with this product. I did notice that my skin was smoother after using, but while applying the scent was so strong it was burning my eyes. I like that it is a thicker cream, but do not care for the film feeling it has left on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been looking for a cream to apply at night for quite some time now. I have combo skin and my skin always tends to be super super oily or extremely dehydrated and parched. This cream was thick and moisturizing and I could feel it penetrating deep into my skin when I rubbed it in. I have been using for two weeks already and genuinely feel like my complexion is much more radiant. Definitely will be buying this again when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After about 2 weeks of using this product I noticed a some breakouts along my hairline and cheek bones, so I layed off nightly use. It is a rich lotion, which I love for my dry wintery skin but it may just be a bit too heavy for my sensitive skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been useing the night and day cream im a new customer for life my face hasnt looked better.... Im 33 and a mother of three. I have used this for two weeks+ & I am in love . My bags are gone I have had at least one complement a day on how beutiful and well rested I look... I recommend L'oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Day and Night Cream too all women over the age of 21 ... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have to say after trying to find a good night cream to help with my dry facial skin and fine lines I think I've hit the jackpot. After using this product for only a week I notice that my skin is much firmer and line free when I wake up in the morning. It isn't greasy and doesn't leave residue on my pillow which is a big plus. I'm using this along with the day cream and am extremely pleased with the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love putting this cream on before bed, knowing that it is keeping my skin moisturized while I sleep. I wake up with supple, smooth feeling skin in the morning, which is awesome! It has a light scent that I enjoy as well. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used the night cream for about over a week now, it seems very thick to me and it is not that easy to get out from the jar. Have to say the jar size is very generous compars to other brands. It does have a very strong perfume scent which I don't really care for. And I also seem to have more break outs since started this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this night cream. I stopped using anti-aging products (which almost always contain retinol) because my skin was looking red. This product did not cause any redness. Used it for 2 weeks nightly without breakouts or irritation. The texture is similar to my high priced dermatologist cream - thick but not greasy, spreads easily without tugging, and sinks in quickly.

"L!Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream, absolutely love it. I could use it day and night. Quickly absorbs and doesn't leave my face greasy looking. Wrinkles are less noticeable.Skin feels plump and soft. I can wear it under makeup without it caking up. ❤️!!! I actually use this cream during the day and the day cream at night, go figure. With continued use it could only get BETTER! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I love LOREAL age perfect cell renewal night cream. I'm a very cautious kind of person when it comes to creams for my face. I have to say I really love it. It wasn't greasy. It has a nice clean smell, it helps nourish and renewed my face, with a firmer fell. I would recommend you try LOREAL age perfect cell renewal it helped me alot.

"To my surprise I actually like this product! It made my skin feel super soft and smooth. It does blur fine lines. I think the scent could be better. It is a mild scent, non offensive but, not pleasing either. No scent at all would be great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love slathering my face with this cream after washing my face and before going to bed. I usually don't put anything else on and yet, the next morning, my skin is soft, bright, and so young looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I think that this product is great so far. I started using it the day that I recieved it and I noticed a change in my skin almost immediately. It is also very light weight and smells great, I will definately be using this product until it is finished and purchasing it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Of all the products that I've used to rejuvenate my skin and give my face a healthier firmer look, the result wasn't what I expected. Until now! After only a few weeks of using this night cream, the results are unbelievable. I love the soft feel it leaves after applying it and better yet, the firm yet soft appearance of my skin that I wake up to in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm one of those people who was very Leary about putting product on my face. I have only used one product since I was a teenager and do not like to experiment when it comes to my face and complexion. I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of using this product. It did not leave my face feeling heavy or sticky. Will definitely continue to use this product. Looking forward to seeing what other products I can try with name brand [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So i think the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream is alot easier on my skin that the day moisturizer. The cream itself almost feels like a putty and not so much of a greasy cream. It definitely went on smooth and smells wonderful. Once it dried, my face felt soft and fresh. Im hoping to see even more results with the days to come. So far my skin has lost its redness and isnt as blotchy as before. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
OMGosh!!! This night cream not only smells fabulous but feels so nice and creamy for dry skin like mine! I kept having my fiance feel my face Hahaha! You only need to use a little dab because it goes quite a long way. So many other night creams end up drying my face but this one didn't and made sure to not use any of my serums while using this product. I've noticed less redness and a smoother texture. Love Love Love!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product felt greasy on the skin and never really fully absorbed. It did plump my skin after wearing it all night but it left my skin oily and greasy. The product just sat on top of my skin instead of absorbing. I wouldn't mind that so much but the thing that made me dislike this product is that it clogged my pores and broke me out. I started getting texture and it just isn't worth my sensitive combination skin getting clogged. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream is fair. I have been using the product for several weeks now and see little results. The product does not provide enough moisture for my skin during this cold winter season. I find myself needing to apply it a couple times throughout the evening. It may be different during the summer months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The name says it all, "" Age PERFECT Cell Renewal Night Cream"". This cream works great leaving skin rejuvenated overnight. In the morning when I wake up my skin feels and looks fabulous. Does not interfere with your make up in the am. It works it's magic overnight and you see results in the morning. Perfect for any age and anyone skin.

"Oh, how I have grown to adore this product! It's is very silky and creamy with a subtle fragrance that is very pleasing! I wasn't sure if I was going to like or because it was so thick, but it feels amazing on the skin! It seems to even out the texture of my skin, and it moisturizes so well! I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the L'Oréal cell renewal night cream. It has a light fresh scent. It is thicker than other creams I have tried and applies so smoothly. It has kept my face well moisturized through the the winter months. The whole cell renewal line is great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used my night cream almost two weeks now and I cannot say enough great things about it, there is no greasy residue when I wake up in the morning. My face is all silky and soft feeling. I did notice a couple of breakouts the first few days but this is normal for me when I change facial products. This is definitely a product to try if you want to have beautiful skin and fight the aging process. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was searching for a night cream that didn't feel like I had wax on my face. This product is it! I put it on nightly after washing my face. It's easy to use, & not greasy. My face feels nice & smooth the next morning. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this night cream. It had a really pleasant smell and it was very thick so I felt like it was a great moisturizer for night time. I noticed my skin felt smoother already the first day after I tried it. It didn't make me break out at all either. I didn't notice any major changes in my skin's appearance, but I am 34 and don't struggle with major wrinkles yet. I did notice less fine lines around my eye area. All in all I think this is a great product and I would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the smell and feel of this night cream! My skin felt great and had a healthy glow without a heavy or greasy feel. I am easily bothered by scents of different products but found the light refreshing scent of this cream mild and pleasant. The night cream is a slightly thicker consistency than the daytime product but doesn't feel heavy or thick on your skin. Personally, I felt using this along with the day cream was a little too much for my skin, but loved both products individually. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have just started using this only two times so far, but it has already made my skin feel better on my face. It is really easy to use you just spread it on your face right before you go to bed and it's not all greasy like some things I have used and it also won't scare your husband to death when he wakes up in the night and looks at you lol,then in the morning just wash it off and your face feels great!

"I'm always looking for a night time cream to apply at home after taking off all my make-up. I like L'Oreal's Renewal Night Cream because of the soft texture and the way it absorbs into my skin.

"I finally put it all together! I am now using the L'Oreal Cell Renewal NIght cream in conjunction with the eye perfecting cream and the day cream. What a difference it has made to my skin feel and color! I am seeing a reduction in those little lines areound my eyes and it has the blotchiness I saq with my old cream disappear!

"This product does what it says. I started using it immediately after receiving. It leaves your skin smooth, unlike other products that leave a greasy like feel. It absolutely smells amazing too!

"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream is a wonderful, creamy face moisturizer that I am just loving!

"This stuff is suuuuper thick, and worked well as the last step in my nighttime routine. It was occlusive enough to seal everything in but didn't feel greasy like some other brands, nor was it so heavy that it gave me clogs. Very light on fragrance, which is great because I'm sensitive to heavy scents. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When i first put this on at night, it felt great. My skin was soft, and well moisturized. However, in the morning, it felt a little too greasy around my forehead and nose area. I had to wash my face twice to get the feeling off. I would probably use this a couple times a week instead of making it part of my nightly routine.

I've never tried only one or two Night creams before. This one surprised me. It has a light fragrance (which smells great!) and I can feel the difference after only a couple of weeks using it. It keeps my skin moisturized and not oily. I have very oily skin and this product didn't add to that which for me is a plus. I'd recommend this to any woman!

I think this product is great. It is lightweight and nongreasy on my face which I love! It made my skin softer and smoother the first night.

"I think the night cream is very soothing at feels great at on your skin when your putting it on your face. The smell seems to relax you too right before bed. The only downside is my face feels puffy after about 20 mins after applying the cream. I show no signs of allergic reactions, it's just a feeling I get and that's the only part i don't like.

"From the moment you open the jar you will feel an overwhelming sense of self. The scent to this lightweight, nongreasy cream is very refreshing. I have been applying right after washing my face at the end of the day. I apply exactly as directed in an upward motion. My face has started to feel firmer in a short time. I am convinced that I definitely need this on my nightstand at all times. I am sold and if you give it a try you will be as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The packaging is a beautiful gold and the shape and size of the tube is perfect for use. I put it on before bed and seemed to soak in well. My skin does seem softer lately.

L'Oréal night cream seemed a bit thick at first but after using it for a couple nights I now crave it! It makes my skinn feel soft & smooth. In the morning after I wash my face I feel my face plump up & looks brighter. I have this little bulges on my cheek bone that I absoul adore but can only make them appear with top of the line face creams...well L'Oréal s night cream brings them out in the morning & I couldn't be happier!

"This formula seems like it would be great for dry skin, but since I'm pretty oily it may have been too much for me. I did really like using it as a hand treatment to moisturize and protect my hands especially in the dry winter months. Your hands are one of the 1st places that start to age so don't neglect them! This cream was affordable enough I don't feel like this is a wasteful use of the product, and if you have normal to dry skin it may be a great fit for your face!

I loved this night cream product. I am not the person to normally worry too much about my skin or skin products. This cream was great though. It was really easy to use and went on super smooth. I noticed right away how soft the cream left my face. The product also has a pleasant smell. The price for this product is good also. The container is a good size and you only need a small amount each night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I'm not greasy feeling or oily at all (and I hate that feeling) I can see a difference using the 2 products together after almost 2 weeks. I'm very satisfied and no matter the price will continue to use [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product every night for over a week and like it. My skin is extra dry with the cold winter weather and this satisfies the dryness without leaving my face oily or sticky. It smells lovely too! The consistency is a little thicker than I would have anticipated but its rubs in just fine. I wouldn't recommend if you have oily skin as it may be too much but otherwise it's been great thus far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"A great light weight feel with a really clean scent. Not an over powering scent. I have really dry skin and I really feel that this is helping to hydrate my skin. It feels so soft.

Have been using the L'Oréal Age Perfect night cream for about 2 weeks now and I love it. I can feel a noticeable difference in my skin. I usually have pretty dry skin in winter.

"As you age, your skin starts to show fine lines and dryness. This night cream rejuvenates and hydrates your skin and makes it look and feel beautiful again. It does not have or leave an oily feel to your face. It leaves it with the softness and smoothness as you had in your younger years. I use it every night before bed and absolutely love it!

I absolutely love this night cream. Best moisturizer I have ever tried in my entire life. I have very rough-looking skin and this works for me . Not over exaggerating my skin was the smoothest and most Supple it has ever been with any moisturizer I have used in last 12 years. I definitely will buy again and again!!!

"I have been using this in conjunction with the night cream for about 2.5 weeks. I was apprehensive about this product initially because my skin can be mixed, however now that I have been using this I can say my skin definitely feels more smooth and makeup applies evenly. I have not had any breakouts after use. I had one small dry spot and after a few days it resolved with use of this cream combo. My FAVORITE part of this the smell - the floral scent is amazing!

This is a solid night cream that does what it's job well. The cream is very thick and little goes a long way. I feel like my skin drinks up the cream as soon as I put it on and I love the feel of my skin after applying. It really does have a feeling of rejuvenation when using. I also like how it leaves a very clean feeling after applying and not overly greasy like some creams. I think this is a good product and highly recommend.

"Love this night cream. It has a very thick, almost whipped texture. The scent is nice and light. I have used it for a week now and definitely see a difference.

"If you are looking for a thick night cream, then this is for you! I liked this better than the day cream since I wasn't applying foundation after using it. I don't like my facial cream to have a scent and this has a strong perfume scent to it. I wasn't a fan of the odor of it, but it did moisturize like it said it would.

"I love this night cream. It's thick and moisturizing but it doesn't break me out. My skin actually looks healthier. The fragrance is a little strong and took some getting used to. It also works great as a hand cream for night time. Overall, thumbs up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The night cream is so soft and absorbs extremely easily. I like that the cream is thicker than normal creams because it takes a smaller amount for each use. This cream is as smooth as butter. After about 7 night consecutive night uses, I liked the way my face had softened. The difference was obvious when I washed my face. After multiple uses, I noticed that my face had areas of small breakouts. I don't think it's bad enough to deter me from use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The scent is very pleasant, not overpowering at all. The cream is very silky and smooth and glides on my face well. But I discovered a little goes a long way. My face is very soft in the morning. So far, so good and I'm hoping to see the cell renewal and improved skin texture and feel [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ive done a few applications (at night) with the Loreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream and I can already feel a sense of rejuvination in my skin. Its a weightless application that doesnt feel caked on or greasy and it really gets the job done! I will continue to apply (both day and night) to give my face the perk it needs for lively looking skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the night cream product consistently since receiving it. I love the texture of the product. Nice and rich feeling and non-greasy. It is a thick cream, but it goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely into the skin. I have noticed that my skin feels very soft in the mornings after using it. I would definitely purchase this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is like butter! It feels like butter, but doesn't make your face greasy like butter. My skin feels sooo soft and supple. My skin gets a little dry in the winter, but hasn't felt or looked dry since I started using this product. Highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This is a really unique item to me. It has a moisturizing feel to it but it absorbs really well into the skin. No oily feeling at all. I was concerned it might clog my pores but after trying it for 2 weeks, I am satisfied that it is not clogging my pores. My skin feels really soft when I wake in the morning .

I love the night cream! I live in New England and the harsh winter dries out my skin. It was looking very dull and dried out. The day after using this cream my face so was soft and hydrated! I highly recommend this cream. I am in my thirties and was looking for the right anti aging solution. I definitely found it and will continue to buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this night cream paired with the day cream. The smell is very good, not to over powering. Day and night cream combination makes my skin plumper, soft, and smooth feeling. Make up mixes well with both. Night cream is perfect texture to not make my face greasy when I wake up. Skin feels refreshed and soft in the morning. Would highly recommend this lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The night cream left my skin like an oil slick the very first time I tried it and the heavy perfume smell was hard to take. I tried it a couple more times, but same result each time. Rather than toss it, I decided to use it as a ""body butter"" on my lower legs, knees, and elbows - it did soften these areas up without making them oily and the smell was far enough from my face that I could breathe. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for about 2 weeks. I haven't noticed any extreme difference. The scent reminds me of putting sunscreen on. It absorbs into the skin and doesn't leave any greasiness which I like.I will continue using it and see if I notice any difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have dry and sensitive skin. This product was amazing. It's a very thick cream, but it doesn't feel heavy on your face at all. It was so moisturizing to my skin as soon as I applied it. After about 10 days of using the product, my face feels better and looks better even with dealing with winter weather. It's soft and feels refreshed.

I started using the night cream about 2 weeks ago and I love love love it!! I wake up with smooth and rejuvenated skin. I use this with the eye cream every night. My fine lines seems to have lessened and my skin feels soft and younger. I would recommend this product to everyone. It will speak for itself if you try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the night cream works well. It blends into skin quickly and has a nice texture and color. The scent is a little too strong like a perfume. I don't like the lid and how it has to screw on just right. I would prefer a pump style. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the night cream has a very pleasant light scent. I liked the smooth creamy texture. I found the cream easy to apply and it was quickly absorbed. I touch my face and it feels soft and smooth. I really like this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is thicker than the day cream, a little more greasy, but seems to work wonders. My face is healthier looking in the morning, and my skin is so soft now. I had very dry skin on my neck and face, and after only a few days of use.....it looks so much better. I may even look a little younger because my face has a healthier glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Been using a week and everyday after the 1st day I have gotten a pimple somewhere spearotic on my face. Haven't had a pimple in for ever. The day cream it light.

At first I thought this would be to heavy for my skin because it's a thick cream but it actually is just what it needed with the dry winter air! I haven't used it long enough to actually see much change though I do think my skin seems to have a more even tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"When used along with the Day Cream, L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Renewal Night Cream creates a 24 hour protective plan for the skin of mature woman. It continues everything that the Day Cream began to keep skin moist and plump so wrinkles and skin become less noticeable. A small amount is all that is needed. Pat it lightly all over the face and neck to create a nighttime barrier to keep skin moisturized and protected. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that this is a pretty good product. I have been using L'Oreal Paris Cell Renewal Night Cream every night for the past two weeks. This cream smells good and does not irritate my skin!

I can already tell a difference in the way my skin looks and feels. Some of the lines on my face are not so disincentive. I would recommend this night cream to anyone, wanting to have younger looking skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream is great. The first time I put it on it stung a little but that did not happen again. The product is thick like creamy butter, which is what I want in a night cream. It's not greasy and has not clogged my pores. My skin has been super dry from running the heater all winter. This cream definitely moisturizers all night and leaves my skin feeling great in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Love the night creme you can feel not only feel how soft this is making your skin but you can also feel the exfoliating effect. Not too greasy just the right amount of mositurizing .

I tried this product and love it. I put it on at night before bed and it has made my skin very smooth. My daughter who is having really bad acne has even tried it and loved it. She also agreed how smooth it made her skin feel. I also loved the smell of it too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"The Age Perfect Cell Renewal Facial Night Cream is thick, and luxurious. The smell is amazing as well, without breaking out my sensitive skin. In one week of use I'm noticing no dryness or flaking, and smaller pores. My skin is now showing the first signs of aging, and this cream has helped the fine lines, dull appearance, and dryness associated. I was running for more before the first jar was empty.

"After I wash my face at night, I apply the night cream. My face doesn't itch during the night and it doesn't feel dry in the morning when I wake up. My face feels smoother and healthy since I have been using the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It did not irritate my skin and did not seem to clog my pores. However I was previously using a moisturizer for sensitive skin and noticed very little difference between this line and my other moisturizers. Also I would not recommend this product for sensitive skin because it is pretty heavily fragranced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Loreal age perfect cell renewal night cream is rich and creamy, but not greasy on my face. My mother in law is staying with us for the holidays, and she has been using it as well! She loves it so much, I'm sure it will find it's way into her bag when she goes home! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very happy with this Night Cream. Definitely a bit thicker and heavier on my face than the Day Cream but I think most people want the heavy duty stuff at night while tucked away in bed. And voila you wake up in the morning with a thoroughly moisturized face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the night cream much better than the day cream. I didn't quite like the smell of it, but prefered the texture of the night cream over the day cream. I have been using it for several days and it has helped with hydration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Before I started using L'Oreal face creams, my face felt dry and dull. The first day I started using my face easily absorbed the creams and felt moisturized. My face felt really good. A few days later you could see the difference my face looked bright and my smaller wrinkles looked minimized. I would recommend this product to my friends and family.

I have been using the product for just about a week now. So far I like the product it's not greasy I am also taking weekly photos to see how much of a change it will make with my skin. I'm excited to find out if I just ran out of the product I was using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This super creamy formula is perfect for night! It's not too heavy or light. I would love to use this on my entire body because it is so smooth! It leaves my skin feeling soft and silky. It does have a nice fragrance, but I would prefer it to be fragrance free for my sensitive nose. Overall Big THUMBS UP! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like that this is part of a two step program. Who needs more then that!? I also like that it is not to thick and not too thin. It absorbs well and has a pleasant very faint scent. You don't need a lot so I think the jar will last a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This face cream is awesome! The consistency is great BUT the fragrance was way too strong for me. It gave me a headache trying to go sleep with it on. My skin does look better though and feels so soft. I was worried about breakouts since my skin is combo oily/dry (mostly dry) and that was not an issue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have oily, acne-prone skin, so the L'Oréal Night Cream leaves my skin feeling too dewy and sticky. It does absorb fairly quickly, but I've been using it a week now and I feel like it's making my skin even more oily than normal. I'm going to keep trying it for the remaining 3 weeks, but haven't seen any positive difference in my skin so far. I'm an optimist, though, so we shall see! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has caused my face to breakout like crazy! I am not acne prone at all, but after 3 days of this product, my face had pimples all over and is really oily! I initially loved the feel and smell of the cream, but this is unacceptable! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After only using this product one time, I have already noticed a pretty large difference. Upon waking this morning, my skin felt completely different. I have always used moisturizing products on my face for the past 20 + years and I can definitely feel a difference with these products. In particular, using such a luxurious product before bed creates a relaxing ritual that made me feel good about what I was doing for myself as well created fantastic results.

"The night cream is a thicker cream which I thought would take a while to soak into the skin, but it goes on very smoothly and no stickiness. It has a pleasant smell.

"After using this product for a week I have noticed that my skin is smooth and soft. My fiancé has also noticed the change and says we will be buying this product for a long time.

I am very amazed and happy with the results. Thank you for allowing me to try this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Unlike the eye cream and the day cream I. this line the Cell Renewal Night Cream did not work out so great which is a bummer, because the day cream and eye cream in this line are fantastic and I highly recommend them both. The night Cream is found to be much more heavily scented and for me the scent did not disappear for a while after application. I also found the night Cream to be very heavy and thick on the skin.

Well I have been using the night cream for a week now. My face broke out really bad after about three days. I liked the smell of the product but it did leave my face feeling a little greasy. I've stopped using it for now until my face clears up. I do plan on giving it another try though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product is great, a little goes a long way, which means I get a lot for my money. My skin is starting to feel smooth and soft. Also I use to have dry skin, but now that I am using age perfect I do not have dry skin at night anymore. Thanks so much for this wonderful night cream.

I found this cream to be as smooth as velvet and it smells wonderful. In just a few days I have noticed a huge difference in the moisture and texture of my skin. I am very surprised at the difference. Many of the moisturizers I have tried left my skin feeling oily but not so with this product. It quickly absorbs and leaves your skin soft and velvety. Wow I love it ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I actually like the creaminessof the night cream better than the day cream. Love how it makes my skin feel and look...even after a good nights sleep! The smell is also great and doesnt take much to cover face, neck, chest and then I still have some for the top of my hands! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Loved this product...its rich creamy and went on smoothly on skin.

I have enjoyed using the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream! During the winter my face tends to get very dry and flaky but this has helped reduce the flakes. It is easy to apply and I also like the way it smells which is a big deal for me! It takes me just minutes before bed to put it on. I have already recommended it to a few friends and will continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This night cream is wonderful, goes on smooth, absorbs fast and leaves my face very soft. It smells nice but it does leave a residue on my pillow if I lay down too soon after applying. I put it on nightly before bed and I can still feel it working in the morning. It is gentle enough for me to use every night and doesn't cause me to break out. I think this is my new go to nightly moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm used to night creams being thick but this product goers to a whole new level and the smell is so fresh! A little goes a long way and my face was not left greasy. This is one of my favorite ever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I usually use products that are not heavy creams or fragrances. I feel these are a bit heavy on both. I have sensitive skin, so I'm curious to see how it does. Only a few days in and it does make my skin feel smoother. More interested to see how eye cream does. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this night cream is great. In just one night My face was softer and very much healthier looking. The only draw back on this product is that it takes a few minutes to dry but the outcome is well worth it. This is a must have for anyone [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product about a week along with the day cream. This product makes a world of difference in your complexion. Your face is brighter and is definitely noticeable. In a weeks time my face is no longer dry and visibly brighter. It works! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The scent and consistency of this product make it feel very luxurious. It has a lovely perfumed scent that is not too heavy. The thick cream consistency is exactly what I want in a night cream. It is very smooth and delivers a great layer of moisture that lasts through until my a.m. routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This nighttime cream works well but the smell was kind of overpowering for me. I used it for a week and while I love how great my skin felt in the morning I didn't like that I could still smell the moisturizer hours later. If they would tone down the scent this would be a fab product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a great cream. I have oily skin. With this cream, when I wake up my skin isn't as oily as it used to be. I've been very pleased with the results from these renewal creams. I've used then just under two weeks and have already had noticeable improvement! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this night cream. The texture is thick, like shea butter, and it doesn't leave my skin greasy. By the first morning after use I could feel that my skin was softer. I noticed visibly improved texture in my forehead in just five days (the box says full results in 30 days). I've even seen a reduction in breakouts, which was unexpected, but likely due to less dryness. I'll definitely continue to use this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cell renewal Cream is rich and very luxurious without feeling greasy.. It glides on beautifully over the cell renewal serum which is really nice. It has a nice subtle smell to it which is very refreshing. I have only used this for the last 3 days, and already I noticed my skin is brighter and more supple. Really looking forward to the results after 1 month's use. I would definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This night cream from L'Oreal performs very well on my skin. I have skin that is slightly dry and older, and this cream provides wonderful moisture and keeps the fine lines at bay.

People never guess my age because my skin is so smooth, and I believe the cell renewal cream deserves some of the credit! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I haven't had this very long, but I love how it makes you skin feel by the morning. L'oreal age purfect cell renewal is a light non greasy skin loving cream I will use from hear on.

"I love the packaging of the Loreal Products. The size is not to big and the Jar has a wide mouth for easy access to the cream. The jar also is easy to open. The cream is silky and soft, leaving your skin just as soft and silky as the cream. The night cream also has a pleasing fragrant smell a little strong when you first put it on but that calms down quickly. Overall an excellent product.

The his L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream is amazing! The cream is really thick. I thought it would be really heavy on my face. Boy was I wrong! It glided on so easy and quickly absorbed into my face. When I wake up my face feels smooth and hydrated! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this night cream! It goes on silky smooth and leaves your skin so soft. It absorbs into the skin fast and does not leave behind any greasy residue. It has a pleasant floral scent that I really like. Since I have been using this product, my skin looks softer, healthier and has a nice glow to it. I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how this cream moisturizes my skin. I used my own cleanser however it may be a good idea to use the cleanser that is part of the product line. The cream smells great! The packaging is appealing. Right after application my skin felt soft and theven cream is light weight and it's not greasy which is nice for my oily skin. Use for at least a min the before you see results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Here´s the thing, I´ve been trying the night cream for a few days now and I just cannot get over that greasy oil feeling on my face all night, it almost feels like mask because it does not absorbs well, so that is a No, No for me. Not all is bad, the cream smells very good and makes your skin brighter almost instantly, so it kind of works. I would change the oily texture for a light and fresh one.

"I used this product overnight and was a bit skeptical that it would work. Well, I have to stand corrected after just 1 night I woke up to glowing, supple skin. The formula went on smooth and luxuriously, making me feel like I imagine Hollywood starlets of old did doing their nightly regiment. In the dry winter months I welcome any extra moisture and this definitely packed it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So, I tried the Age Perfect L'OREAL cell renewal night cream and...I...LOVED IT!! It's a nice think cream that comes in attractive packaging and makes your face feel amazing. In the winter months my skin gets so dry. This cream has helped tremendously and it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this before I go to bed along with the eye cream and it is so amazing the results I see every morning. Crowsfeet are slowly disappearing along with my under eye bags. With continued use I am sure there a well be a very dramatic difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just received the L'OREAL Campaign in the mail and I'm so excited to get started with the products. You see I have always had trouble with dark circles under my eyes and just recently I have noticed some line forming around my lids too. As far as the Cell renewal for night and day my face has always been bumpy and had dry spots so I'm can't wait to to see the before and after. I will be sure to share the photos with all of you too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I normally don't like night cream because they feel so heavy and greasy but this one is great. It feels so moisturizing and it's not at all greasy. I put it on before bed and wake up with such soft skin. It even smells awesome. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I began using this line of products 5 days ago and I must say I'm hooked! The Cell Renewal Night Cream feels wonderful and has a very nice smell. I dislike medicinal and overly scented products, but this one is perfect. I started off just using on my face only, but after a day or two I began using it on my neck as well. I definitely will continue using this night cream. It's cashmere for your face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cream had a pleasant smell, but it was a bit strong. The texture itself was a bit thick and I would wake up every morning feeling oily still. I didn't mind it overall and I believe that it did have some positive affects on the overall aging of my skin just wasn't the right cream for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only been using this cream for about a week but so far I like it. It is very thick. The cream looks like a thick butter. It has a nice smell that does not linger. I have sensitive, acne prone skin and have not noticed any breakouts. Has not done anything for my fine lines but it is way too soon for any results to show. The packaging is nice and heavy, looks better than some really high end brands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As soon as I got my night time shower, I applied the night cream. It has a very nice smell and a little bit definitely goes a long way. I just don't like the way it makes my face feel after applying it. It made me feel oily and shiny and I really wanted to go wash it off (but I didn't so I could see what it would do). It just wasn't for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the night cream every night (after washing my face) along with the eye cream. I start at the neck and gently work my way up causing as little stress on my skin as possible. I really like how my skin is feeling since starting the regimen with the L'Oreal skin renewal. I have rough dry skin on my face in the winter and so far my skin is staying smooth and soft. I will definitely give this 5 stars if it keeps doing this well!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a fantastic cream. It is so soft and creamy. I have been applying it every night for about a week now and I definitely notice that my skin is much more radiant in the mornings and over all. This night cream works wonders on my dry skin. I am very please with the product. It just feels good to go to sleep knowing you will wake up looking more refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this night cream for about a week now and I really like it. It has a nice, subtle scent and it feels good going on. My skin feels soft and moisturized. I notice that when I wake up in the morning, my skin seems fresher and plumper. I suffer from very dry, flaky skin. I've noticed that since I've been using this night cream, the flakes on my forehead and nose are gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This night cream is one of the best I've tried. I love the velvety consistency, and I love how soft my skin feels the next morning! It has not caused any break outs or irritation, and a little goes a long way-so this jar will last months and months. A great value and a great product!

I have been using L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect cell renewal night cream and I love it. My skin looks and feels younger. My step dad saw me at Thanksgiving and then Christmas Eve and noticed I look a lot younger. I would recommend this product to all. I love it. It's the best anti aging cream I've ever used. I loved how my skin looks and feels [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The night cream is slightly mose solid so you just need to rub your fingers over it to get the small amount you need. I have sensitive skin so one of the first things I look for is if it makes me break out. Happily it doesn't. There is no residue left once your skin absorbs the cream. My skin looks brighter and more smooth. I also really love the scent of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream is by far the best night cream I have ever used. I have tried high end products that can not compare to the results I have been noticing in my skin. I wake up in the morning my face feels so soft and I feel like I look younger. It doesn't feel sticky or greasy and smells great. It's definitely affordable which is the best part! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used the night cream for a week now, love the smell! However the product states that you see results after a week, I have noticed no results as the product states. I give it 4 starts because I can feel a tingle on my face as if it may be doing something and will give it more time to see if there are any results.

This night cream works wonders on my skin. Im 31 years old and i feel like its time to change up my skin care regemin. My skin was beginning to become dry and it scared me a bit. The reality im not 20 anymore is sinking in and i need to fight the signs of aging. This cream is really thick and creamy. It has restored the moisture to my skin. It has given it a youthful look and glow. Im very impressed and im in love with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the night cream for about a week now. It is a thicker product than the day cream but is not greasy at all. It stays on my face and not on my pillow. My face seems brighter and my face feels smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Before I try this product, I have been using department store name brand. But I would say, I quite surpurise this product is very thick and absorbs when you massage in circulation after couple nights I feel my skin smoother and softer. It smells very good.

I think this product is amazing. I've had a head cold and my nose was dried out i put this night cream on and in the morning my face and nose was moisturized like i had never had been sick.

I will definitely keep using it to see what else it does. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Package looks great! Opening the container and the perfume smell was not over powering like I expected. I added the night cream to one side of my face. It made my face feel so soft so I put the cream over my whole face. After a few nights my face feels softer. I did not notice anything else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This stuff is awesome. I have used it several times and can tell a difference in the feel of my skin. I have been pairing it with the day cream. Can't wait to see how much more that it can do to my wrinkles even. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My face feels so much better and more moisturized and I've only been using it for 4 days!!! I wish there were better directions for use on the bottle. I have tried the day cream but only in the shower. Tonight I will start the eye serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked it well enough. It wasn't to heavy or greasy. I have been using it in conjunction with the day cream and eye cream. Seems good so far. Face does feel soft. As far as making me look years younger, well maybe a year or two lol. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Loreal cell renewal night cream is wonderful. I used this cream every night before bed and watched my skin transform to look amazingly younger more radient and beautiful. Also i have extremely sensitive skin yet this cream was great an perfect for any skin type. 5 stars [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think I always need to buy this Night Cream, as I always must buy the Day Cream. So so so good. Luxurious feel, wonderful scent. A great value. And I love it that a little goes a long way. I would recommend this to everyone......men, too....they have skin, too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It was smooth as I put it on my face. It seemed to work great. The only thing i was disappointed in was that it is a little greasy once it stays on your face. I got up the next morning and still felt the greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Amazing job with this product L'Oréal! It feels so great going on and when I wake up the affects are jaw dropping! I feel like I have brand new skin overnight with the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream! I can't wait to use it every night! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After trying the eye renewal and the day cream I was looking forward to the night cream. This was just ok for me. I couldn't rub it in enough. With this line a dab is enough. I think this should come with an overlay to put on your face to protect your bed linen. Kind of greasy, but it seems to work. My face seems more hydrated and refreshed. More pros than cons. I'll continue using for the benefits of great skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"L'Oreal night cream is fantastic, it does make your skin look resilient and radiant. It works as if you' ve had a mini facelift in your sleep; I think this is one of the best products I have used in a long time. Compared to Olay skincare products this is by far is a cut above the rest. my skin has never looked better and has never felt so smooth. People already think I look younger than my age but now they really compliment my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Really excited about this night cream. The texture is amazing and the feel of it when applied is smooth and soothing. Can already tell a difference in my skin even with this incredibly harsh winter weather. I'll continue to buy Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream from Loreal even after my sample is gone! Trying this is loving it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I put the night cream on before I went to bed to see how it would work. Never used night cream just day cream only. Woke up my skin was soft and felt younger than before. I tell all my friends about it so they can try it. Before I buy a product want to make sure it does what it saids. Very happy with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the night cream; it was rather heavy this would be fine if when you wake up and its absorbed well this still felt very heavy on my face. My skin was very soft but it had a greasy feel to it. This is a good product if you have dry skin. I was hoping it would feel like the day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The first thing that I noticed about this product was the packaging. The brushed gold jar & shiny gold lid gives a distinctly luxe appearance. The fragrance, while pleasant was a bit heavy for taste. The cream itself was very light & absorbed into my skin quickly. It left my face feeling smooth & hydrated, not greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This night cream was definitely a surprise! First thing that made me extremely happy was the wonderful smell! This smooth cream has a clean perfume fragrance that I enjoyed. The cream itself is somewhat oily but I noticed in the morning that my skin was dry and smooth. I'd suggest using a small amount for your entire face. Overall I'm pleased with this product and would use it as my facial regimen in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how thick and creamy this night cream is! I just put it on and my skin feels very soft. My only complaint and the reason I gave it only 4 stars is the fragrance. I am very sensitive to scented things. I'm hoping I don't have a reaction to it but so far so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The formula is not to heavy for a night cream and wears light on my skin. A small amount goes a long way. Make my skin feel amazing in the morning. The smell is a little too sting that is why i gave it a 4. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am a bit sensitive to fragrance. That being said, when I put on this night cream it was really hard to deal with the perfumed smell. It did feel like my skin was soft but I just can't continue to try this product because of the strong fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a little nervous to try this night cream, as my skin is sensitive and I break out easily; however, I have not had any issues with this night cream. My skin is nice and soft and when I wake up in the morning my skin still feels hydrated. Very nice product. I also appreciate that is doesn't have a heavy scent. Great product by L'Oreal.

"it's important to keep that skin fresh day and night, especially in cold winters with drying heat circulating in our dwellings.

"I have a lot of issues with products, due to having sensitive skin. I've only had the product for a few days and already noticed a difference. My skin is smoother and looks healthier.

"First of all let me say it smells amazing just like the accompanying day cream. Second, it is super greasy. I broke out the first time I used it.

This product helped my skin not feel so dry and fatigued. I could feel a real difference after just one use. I do feel the product should be in a lotion type bottle so there is ni getting too much. It takes very little of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoy this product and I now have a back up of it. I was recently using ""yes to blueberries"" eye cream and I didn't really see any change to my under eyes. I usually get puffy eye when I wake up and was using that to try and solve the problem. After using the L'Oreal I can see a real change. Along with my under eye makeup applying a lot easier. My puffy eyes have be noticeably less puffy. You don't need a lot and it covers your whole eye. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've added this product into my night time regimen. I use it before applying a sheet mask and it has been giving my skin a great moisture boost. I have oily skin and it doesn't give me a heavy feeling and absorbs really quickly into my skin. Though I don't like using my fingers to take product out of a pot. The product is to creamy for a pump. and it has a strong fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This product is very rich and it is super moisturizing. It's perfect for the winter since I tend to get really dry.

"First impression right out the box was ""wow I love this packaging with gold"" and how solid the products felt in my hand. I love the smell!! I was well surprised to noticed this product had a nice creamy texture and wasn't oily on my skin.

Some products I have tried leaves a sticky feeling after applying it but that definitely was not the case with this product. It left my face feeling renewed and silky. It doesn't leave a heavy feeling either which is a plus! It does have a scent to it but to me it's more of a refreshing smell. The picture below is before I used the eye renewal. So if you would like to see the difference I left a review on the eye renewal as well. Works well together especially if you have bags under your eyes.

"I have been using the eye cream for 3 day now and I have already noticed a difference in my dark circles. I was amazed at how quickly this worked! I am hopeful that it will completely remove my dark circles. My puffiness has also decreased, but not as much as the dark circles. I can't wait to see what my eyes look like after a week! If dark circles are your biggest eye concern, this is the product for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is the best night Cream I have ever tried. It's not too thick like many of the others and it's not greasy at all therefore it doesn't get on your pillowcases/sheets. I'm rating it 5/5 because it does everything it's suppose to! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As a mom, I try not to put sticky, smelly or harmful any things on my face because I'm always holding someone! I have always been afraid to get my lotions on my babies sensitive skin or have horrible smelling stuff near them while rocking to sleep.

I tried the loreal cell renewal night cream. I have noticed a slight diminish in the wrinkles on my face. Has a very pleasant scent and feels smooth. It quickly absorbs into skin so going to bed with it on is not a problem. Definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First off it smells wonderful! My husband even commented on how my face smelled so sweet! It could be a little overwhelming if you may be going straight to bed but I do my nightly routine a few hours before actually laying down to go to sleep.

Okay so my first impressions ... I really like that this night cream has substance to it. It's thick and a little more scented than my personal taste though not omg too much. It goes on easily and my face just sucked it up. It feels really nice on my face.... Not greasy. We'll see how the renewal part works out and I'll keep you posted.

I thinks these great product love them very creamy and silly love the way they feel on my face...the eye serum is so smooth and velvety and silky like butter.

I bought this product about a month ago and I love it. I can feel it working as soon as I put it on. It feels great!
I love the way this smells and I love how soft my skin feels. It's thicker than the day cream (like a thick body cream) so it seemed to take a little more to rub in. Not greasy like the day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal cream is light and creamy. It goes on smooth and light. It gives my skin a chance to breathe while I am sleeping. I love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The only thing it doesn't do is out you to sleep faster so far so good u really like it. My skin (using this Loreal product 3rd day) is softer to the touch. Lovely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think they did get, didn't leave face oily mad it soft, I highly recommend the whole set. Never thought that using the night cream while I slept would help during the day. I am glad I tried this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've tried this product the past 4 nights only difference I can tell is my skin feels firm. That is a good thing. Definitely need to give this product more time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The fragrance is too strong for me. My asthma was triggered by this product. I would definitely be interested in an unscented version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was very rich and felt nice on my skin. Didn't really like the fragrance- but it seemed to fade quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This night cream made my combination skin Super oily. I tried it for a few nights in a row, and had the same experience. Now I have massive break outs on my face. :( [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've noticed my skin is another and younger looking, after only a week. The product feels really nourishing to my dry skin. I love the packaging, and it definitely feels high-end. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm in LOVE! I have this patch of extremely dry skin on my cheek and after just 2 days of using this product it's gone. My face feels fantastic and oh so smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
