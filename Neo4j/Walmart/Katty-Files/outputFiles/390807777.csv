I am so grateful for Derma RPX. I am not self cautious about my puffy eyes in the morning anymore. With the product a little goes a long way. I have seen an improvement in my dark circles as well. I apply it under my makeup and it is as if I didn't put anything on. I like that it is not oily and that it blends well with my makeup. I also apply it when I don't wear makeup and its as if I didn't put anything on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After Derma RPX usage, my forehead lines are not visible. I apply it nightly after makeup removable and skin care. It tightened the area where wrinkles are visible. I apply with 2 fingers in a circular motion and im impressed with its results. Im 54 years old with forehead wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this for my wife as a birthday gift. She's been talking about bags under her eyes and wrinkles and that stuff. I will say she's always been one to moisturize and take care of her skin, but now as we're closer to 50 those little aging things are showing a little more. I think she looks beautiful no matter what but it matters to her so it matters to me. Overall she likes the product. It's helped bring a little more glow back under her eyes. It's a keeper for her.

"This cream is excellent for my skin. It adds moisture and hydrates my skin, making it feel soft and smooth. My skin is clear and glowing. Redness is going away. I put the cream on at night, and I wake up with hydrated skin! I would recommend this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this several times around and under my eyes and really did not see much difference. It does go on smooth without caking. However, it feels similar to kids glue as it dries just pulling skin slightly taunt. It leaves a flaky, dry, scaly residue. I really did not see any obvious results after 5 or 15 minutes or after several application uses of this skin cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the Derma RPX hoping to get rid of the appearance of my fine line wrinkles around my eyes. The product says it can work in as little as 5 minutes!! I wasn't that lucky. I foloowed the directions completely, but I didn't notice any change for about 30 minutes, and then it only worked on my very fine lines but didn't change the appearance of any others. I am going to keep trying this product to see if it works better over time, but so far I am not impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been skeptical about products claiming to reduce fine lines, under eye bags, etc, immediately, short-term. DermaRPX site offered 2 for 1 deal and I couldn't help myself, lol. At least I now know to continue on with my skepticism. This product did nothing to improve anything. The only difference I could tell was my skin felt smooth, the same as it does if I use a primer."
"I was extremely excited to try DermaRPX because of fine lines under my eyes. It claims that it is a fast acting wrinkle reducing cream, works in as little as 5 minutes and smooths skin under eye. Sadly, these claims were not true, as it did nothing for me. It did go on smooth though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this around my eyes as directed. There were no adverse effects, but not a really big change either. It kinda feels like a dried thin layer of school glue or something, just sort of stiff where I put it. Not really sure that this stuff is capable of the miracles that it promises.

"I was skeptical at first. But, I did notice a difference in my skin. Their were fewer fine lines. My skin was noticeably softer. I kinda had a glow going on. I will use this product more often. Smell was jot overpowering either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This stuff works well. I will continue to use this for some time to come. I really like the way this glides on and makes wrinkles minimize. It feels weightless and is not noticeable at all. I put my makeup on over it and wallah feeling great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"To be really honest. I can't tell too much of a difference using this product. I've been using it for about two weeks and can't really tell a change. However, maybe if the directions were more specific it would be helpful. The directions state to wash your face and put it on. So I guess it goes under makeup? Morning AND night? It says to ""avoid overuse"", but no indication of what that means. I wasn't impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My wife loves Derma RPX! She has very light wrinkles under her eye and just a little on her forehead. This makes them less noticeable it pulls the skin slightly making it taunt and wrinkles are gone. I highly recommend this to anyone who need just a touch of wrinkles to be less noticeable [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Was so excited to use this, hoping it would work on my wrinkles around my eyes but it was a bit underwhelming. I did not really notice a difference, maybe a tiny tad, but it felt kind of sticky. It felt like it was pulling on my under eye areas so it felt more like a lightweight glue. It was easy to apply though and seemed to get less sticky as it dried but it still felt like it was pulling on my eyes. I will use it a few more times to see if I get a better result.

I chose the Derma RPX to try. I like it because it improves my skin! I would definitely recommend this to my family and friends! It helps with wrinkles and fine lines! Definitely a product to have on hand! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Derma RPX is a great eye care product. This is a great brand. It does it job and make my eyes look even younger. I use everyday not putting much under my eye and it work great. Love it. Best to use everyday on the go. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the Derma RPX. I find it works good, but for me it took more than five minutes to see a difference. It did not work on deep wrinkles, just the light ones. If you have light wrinkles than I would recommend the Derma RPX. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this multiple times to see if it lightened or tightened my under eye baggage and unfortunately there was absolutely no difference in any before / after photos I took. I was very excited to give it a go because I'm very self conscious about it but it fell short. It did make my under eye makeup apply better but I'm afraid that's as far as it went. I guess I can always just use it as a makeup primer? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
this is junk. it did nothing to get rid of puffiness under eyes or fine lines. don't waste your money on this product.
It doesn't do what it says. Very disappointed!! I waste my money
