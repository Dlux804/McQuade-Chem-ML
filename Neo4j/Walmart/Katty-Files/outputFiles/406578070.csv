"I'm 23 but I have horrible under eyebags. I used this, and I noticed a difference right away. It softens and brightens my skin like nothing else! Over the past few weeks, I even started using it (sparingly) on my whole face. This product works wonders!"
Started using revitol lift eye cream and day cream about 3 years ago. The product is amazing the compliments I get every day on how young I look and house great my skin looks tell the story. Now at 45 I'm finding that when I wake up in the morning my skin is dry which has never happened before so now I'm going to try the bright lift day product to see if that helps create additional moisture and see even the skin tone even more will keep you posted
I love this eye cream! I've been using for over 15 years. It greatly decreases the appearance of fine lines and dryness without making your face feel or look overly tight. It gives you a all day Dewey healthy glow. I ALSO USE IT lightly over my entire face especially on the lines around my mouth and forehead. Even after you have your makeup on you can use it throughout the day to lightly touch up around your eyes and smile lines.
"I've been using Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream for well over a year now and I love it! It's the perfect weight without oily feel of other creams I've tried. Also, it doesn't over moisturize causing eyes to look more puffy."
"Love, love, love! I wake up in the morning and can't wait to see my eyes. I don't look tired any more! I use it in the morning and at night. As a matter of fact my husband has noticed the change as well."
"The results of this cream are almost instant, my bags and wrinkles appear smoother and less visible. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have a question. I have been using Revitalift day & nigh cream for years. I am 76 and every one thinks I am younger. My last jars I bought did not seem to feel like the prior ones I had used. My face and neck seem to wrinkle overnight. The jars did not indicate retinol. My question is did you change the ingredients?
"i like the smooth texture of this eye cream and it's very soothing to my entire eye area...i have allergies, so I am constantly rubbing my eyes and this cream helps to soothe the dry, irritated skin around my eyes"
I like this product. I use it around my lips too. It's light-weight and makes my skin soft after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My favorite Revitalift product. I have had horrible puffy bags and dark circles for years. I didn't realize the difference the eye cream was making until a month of using this eye cream. I was applying makeup and didn't need to use anything more than foundation under my eyes. I had been needing a mix of heavy corrective concealer, but not anymore. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Revitalift eye cream for over 5 years and have LOVED it, but yesterday I purchased it and you've obviously changed something. My eyelids used to feel more moisturized when rubbed all in, now it feels more tacky to the touch (and LESS moisturized). I have to use much more product and it still is not good. The old packaging said Pro-retinol and Stimuplex, now it just says Pro-Retinol. I am looking at other brands because the new formula is awful."
"Y'all.. this was a random drug store impulse purchase because I'd been noticing extra ""smile lines"" or ""crows feet"". It was cheap enough and I figured.. what the heck? A week later and I SWEAR they are near invisible. I'm younger, 25, so maybe my skin bounces back quickly but I'll continue to buy this until they stop making it."
"I actually just bought this product today and within the first 30mins of applying for the first time 90% of puffiness is gone and I can't see any dark circles anymore. I'm super impressed and can't wait to see what it does for my fine lines! Compared to other (significantly more expensive) products I've used, this is the fastest I've seen results. I will definitely be getting more from this line! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried various products over the years to minimize the bags under my eyes, some of them quite expensive. This one works! It is important to use it EVERY day. I see a difference if I don't. I forgot to bring it on a weekend trip and could see the difference on Monday. By the way, I am 73 and have been dealing with this problem for many years!"
I've been using this or years. Getting t from Jet is so convenient. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used a ton of different eye creams, including some very expensive ones and this is the only one that actually made a difference. The little crows feet lines around my eyes are fading and my skin looks much smoother around my eyes."
I've only been using it several days and can already see a difference. I have sensitive skin and have tried several other drugstore brands to no avail. This one is a winner!!
"This is a nice eye cream. I cant say anything particularly wow'd me about, but it did do a nice job of making my eye area feel hydrated. It did firm nicely too."
"When I used this product I could tell a difference right away. The skin around my eyes was noticeably softer. I don't have too many wrinkles yet, but sometimes I have darkish areas under my eyes and this brightened them some."
I am so surprised at how well this works on your crows feet by your eyes. It has been lessening them over time. Just started using it so I can't wait to see more results.
I have always struggled with dark circles under my eyes. This cream has been great at helping brighten up that area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a free sample from @Topbox Circle and I like the LOREAL Wrinkle Expert eye cream as it does feel good around the eye area and also feels smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have super sensitive eyes - I can't normally wear mascara and I've had trouble with eye creams, but this it hasn't bothered my sensitive eyes at all! But - while its gentle - I'm seeing less puffiness even during allergy season. I'm sold! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
this cream is great for my skin and make me feel younger
I've been using this eye cream for years and I only have a few fine lines in my under eye area even though I am in my early forties.
"I was very pleased with the product, I would definitely buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Bought it for my mom and she said it's nice and comfortable! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It really does reduce puffiness and reduce fine lines! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I was younger, I was a little lazy at times about protecting my eyes - but now, I can't afford an eye lift or botox and i need to do something about it. This eye cream is absolutely creating smoother, firmer skin the area around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this for four weeks, but I didn't see much improvement with the dark circles under my eyes. I can't really blame the product though. I honestly, have not had the most luck with eye-creams. My dark circles have been with me since birth and unfortunately, it looks like concealer is the only thing that will ever successfully camouflage the dark circles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a beautiful eye cream. Just a tiny bit under my eyes and on my upper lids moisturizes, firms, and reduces the appearance of fine lines. It's not super heavy so I can use it both at night and in the morning before I put on my makeup. This is some good stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This eye cream is phenomenal. I am only 23 so I don't have any eye wrinkles yet, but I have been cursed with terrible dark undereye circles. This cream is the ONLY thing I have ever tried that almost entirely gets rid of them (and I have tried $40 department store creams). Highly recommended...works like a charm, and you can't beat the price!"
but this product works wonders for retaining moisture and reducing undereyes
I'm in shock with this!! Why haven't I gotten this before?!
I have been using this product for years. It helps to reduce fine lines around my eyes. Love it.
"Very good product, i recommend to everyone this product"
"I use this around my entire eyelid at niight, my eyelids skin feels smoothe"
Effective for under-eye woes and dilemmas! Amazing
Makes my skin feel soft and reduces wrinkles. Awesome product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A little expensive but very good. I would reccomend this to people. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Have used your products many years, been satisfied until I tried this eyec cream. Absolutely no improvement/change , VERY disappointed with this product. Have used product for over 9 months, so SHOULD notice something by now."
"I tried this for 3-4 weeks. After the first 10 days, I had a noticeable decrease in puffiness and fine lines. I absolutely recommend that anyone looking to try a quick, easy regimen that will definitely show results within a few weeks, try the Loreal Revitalift Anti Wrinkle Firming Line. My family is getting them for the holidays! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using L'Oreal Revitalift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream for almost 4 weeks and I'm a little disappointed. I was very excited to try this eye cream because I have dark circles and fine lines but I didn't see any improvement. It is in fact a good moisturizer for the eyes delicate area but that's it! My dark circles and my fine lines are still there like day one. I'm going to keep using it to see if my eyes need more time to get improved. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the RevitaLift firming eye cream from L'Oreal for about 4 weeks now along with the day cream from the same line. I do feel like the eye cream has improved the appearance of the skin around my eyes. I feel the puffiness has gone down and some of those fine lines are not as noticeable. I thought it would be a pain to have to use multiple products, but it has quickly and easily become part of my routine. I am glad that I had the chance to try out these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I've been using this cream for weeks and I love it! The eye cream has made such a difference. I can tell my dark circle are lightening up and my wrinkles aren't as bad. Being that I'm 40 now this is definitely something that concerns me. I have now found my go to products for wrinkles. My skin is so much softer too. I highly recommend Revitalift Firming Eye Cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Just turned 40 on 11/24 so this eye cream came at a great time! I believe I have saved my youth (I work at 2A sometimes) by drinking coffee and GREAT EYE CREAM! THIS one is great wear it at night and morning with my makeup!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Wow! I can't believe I have already seen results. My eyes have less crows feet and the ones I still have are less noticeable. One reason I didn't like to buy anti aging creams as took so long to work. Didn't know if working or not. I feel so good about this. So glad I got to try this. Can't believe this stuff is already working. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this product for almost a month and am thankful for the routine it helped me establish. The eye cream was my favorite from the line. There was a small but of a noticeable difference but definitely not what I was hoping for. It smelled like a hospital so that wasn't very appealing but the texture was nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I don't really dark circles under my eyes but I thought I would try the eye cream anyway. I only had a few weeks to try it so the results weren't too noticeable. I did see that my eyes were less puffy. I didn't see too much difference with the darkness that I do have under my eyes. Like I said I didn't have much time to see results but I'm still using it. I think I'll notice a difference when I use it for a few more weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked this eye cream. Although I didn't notice any anti wrinkle or firming going on, I like the way this eye cream feels on the skin around my eyes. It is refreshing, and I enjoy putting it on in the morning and at night before bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream for four weeks and saw no improvements in wrinkles, puffiness, or dark circles. On the plus side, the product did not irritate my skin or eyes, which typically happens with other products I've tried. I wouldn't recommend this or purchase it for myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the eye cream at night for a couple of weeks now. I don't notice a huge difference in wrinkles disappearing, but what I have noticed is that the blue skin tone I've inherited underneath by eyes has gone away. Wonderful stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The RevitaLift Eye cream was a little thick and I found it difficult to smooth in completely without being overly rough on the delicate skin. I did enjoy the cream as a moisturizer around the eye area, but did not notice any firming or wrinkle smoothing. I think one jar will last a long time though and I will continue to use it until it is all gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have never used an eye cream. I was a bit unsure what to expect. However, I must say that I really like using this RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream. It is smooth, non greasy! It doesn't make me worried about gross oily residue. This will definitely be my go to for future eye cream!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this cream for 4 weeks and I love it. I usually do every single day under my makeup. Is 100% fragance free, non greasy and give to my skin everything need it. Reduces dark circles and my skin looks smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really loved the way this contour cream feels on my skin. Im not sure my skin looks firmer or not, but my skin feels super soft. I tend to break out from many products that i use and this didnt give me any clogged pores or pimples. I would definitely get this again and i am super thankful to Loreal and bzzagent for givibg me the chance to try it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's a good moisturizer. I didn't notice any extra tightening, but I only got a couple of weeks to test it out. It usually takes closer to 6 weeks to notice a difference with OTC products. If you're looking for immediate results, you'll want to look elsewhere. But I truly believe given the proper amount of time it would have a great effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The eye cream goes a long way and is easy to apply and smooth under the eyes. It made my eye skin feel good. My skin was moisturized and looked smoother. It's a good way to get more youthful-like eyes without having to work hard at it. It does need some continued use before you start seeing results but you will most definitley see a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I give this a 4/5 because I really can't see a difference in my under eye area. I try to pay attention and see if there's noticeable improvement. I will say my skin feels softer and smoother. Does that mean it's firming my under eyes up??? I like it and will continue to use it. It goes on smooth, soaks in nice and doesn't leave me feeling greasy. Great application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Old age is starting to catch up with me and it's showing under my eyes. Help with bags and droopiness is much needed. Right away, I could feel under my eyes starting to firm up when I put this on before bed. I could see the difference when I woke up and looked in the mirror. This will be going into my regular beauty regime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
While i liked this product im not sure how much of a difference it truly firmed the skin under my eyes. I however didnt have much sag under eyes so maybe that is why. I did use it faithfully for about 4 weeks but for me do not feel its s product i will need everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have enjoyed using this eye cream, absorbs quickly and not too thick or heavy or greasy. It also works well with makeup, doesn't make foundation or concealer cake up under your eyes. Just remember to go easy, you only need a little, and it goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like that this is not as sticky as other creams i have used in the past. The scent is light and barely noticeable. Doesn't take much time to dry, so you can put on your makeup and go. It does tend to make it easier for makeup to smudge/etc, but i don't mind too much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the eye cream. I apply it each night and see an improvement after 3 weeks. The fine lines on the corners of my eyes are barely noticeable. The dark circles under my eyes are better, too. I am anxious to keep using this product to see how much better it will continue to get. I do like the aroma of the products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm liking this product more and more as I'm using it. The consistency is nice. It's think but not at all greasy. I like that theirs no fragrance that I can tell. On the other items like the day cream the fragrance isn't my cup of tea... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This Amazing eye cream has worked wonders for the puffiness under my eyes. However I couldn't really tell about the dark circles which was one of my major concerns, but I havent seen much of a difference with the lighting of the dark circles. Its only been 3 weeks so I will continue to try this out it may take a bit longer to see improvements for the under eye dark circles that i have. But I love the creaminess of the product and its non grease texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Really Love this hydrating eye cream. I look forward to applying it every night after cleansing my face because the lines and arrange around my eyes need it!!! Call me stingy.. but I am trying to use it only once a day so I don't run out. This is good stuff! My wrinkles aren't as noticeable, skin as lose dull or dry, and I start out the day looking younger. Anyone, regardless of age or skin type, can benefit from this little bit of magic for your eye area!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The price was very good compared to what I have been using. did not like the markings on the jar hard to tell from neck cream. I ended after two days using a sharpie and writing on the lid face. product seemed to feel sliggtly tacky even after a couple of hours. I wound not buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've had bags under my eyes for years. It didn't matter if I had enough sleep, they wouldn't go away. I've been using the eye cream twice a day for a few weeks now and have noticed a significant reduction in the puffiness. Don't mean to brag, but I look great!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoy using the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream mist importantly because it doesn't irritate my eyes. It's very gentle and soaks in easily so I don't have to press around the tender areas around my eyes to apply it. It lasts all day without feeling greasy. After it dries, I can apply makeup over the top of it without it smearing my makeup! RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream Even has a nice light scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream works beautifully! It soaks in very quickly so it doesn't leave a greasy mess on my pillow case. My skin feels moist while wearing the night cream and feels soft, smooth and rejuvenated after washing the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Night Cream off in the morning. It feels like it really makes a difference on my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Firming Eye cream goes on smooth. it took a bit to sink in my skin, but it felt good. It didn't leave a film. I've put it on now for the last week, but I don't expect results in that amount of time. So I can only review how it feels on my face. I think it's a great product and will continue to use it to see what the results may be! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found the firming eye cream to be very nice. I've not yet seen the affects of the eye cream, but it's only been 10 days. I love L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift products and recommend them to all my friends and family! Before trying this product, I had not found one worth talking about. Keep us the great work L'Oreal!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream is a nice fragrance free product that is safe for contact lens wearers like myself. I don't have dark circles under my eyes, but my under eye skin is not as firm as it was during my younger days. The cream is not greasy and goes on well. I didn't notice a big difference under my eyes, but I will keep on using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. My eyes don't have that tired look anymore. They look like I got some rest, even if I haven't. I will definitely be continuing to use it and I'm not a beauty cream kind of girl. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A little goes a long way with L'Oréal RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream. This eye cream is perfect for my dry, sensitive skin. I have been using this eye cream for over two weeks and I have seen changes to how puffy my eyes are and I've also noticed a smoothing of wrinkles under my eyes. With consistent use, I believe that this product would significantly reduce my crows feet and under eye wrinkles. I'm impressed with this product and will be buying it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have enjoyed using this product for the last 3 weeks. At first I thought my under eye area was fine, didn't see anything wrong with it, but I went ahead and used it twice daily and I have noticed a difference. My under eye area firmer and more youthful looking! Best of all is how quick and easy it is to throw on, just rub some in on the area and go about your business! I will continue using this product daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the eye cream was very nice, smooth texture and cool to the touch. After using for three weeks, I'm impressed with how soft my eye area is. I'm hoping to eventually see some of my fine lines disappear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Every night for over two weeks I use the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream am I am still waiting for any noticeable results, unfortunately. Even when I apply the cream, there is no tingling or tightening sensation at all, what so ever. Therefor, I genuinely feel that this product does not live up to the expectations. L'Oreal is such a well known brand, I am surprised by the products lack of performance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the eye cream for 3 weeks and unfortunately, have not seen any significant results. I don't have many wrinkles in that area, so I was really looking more for less puffiness in the under eye area. Disappointed that I haven't seen better results. I would not buy this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've only been using this product for about 10 days and I've noticed a difference around my eyes. My crows feet aren't as pronounced. I will definitely buy this product when my trial is finished. It makes me look less tired. THAT is an accomplishment! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the RevitaLift Firming Eye cream for a few weeks now. I do notice an improvement in the firmness of my skin. The cream was a little heavy for the eye area, but not uncomfortable to wear. If it was lighter and a little less fragrance, I would be sold! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cream feels good, and like it's working, but not sure I see any real difference at all. I am hoping and waiting for my under-eye bags to disappear, but maybe that's just too much to hope for! I will keep using it and expect the change it promises. It can't hurt to try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been trying the whole line of revitalift. I was unsure in the beginning anything would work. I have been using the products for a few weeks and I'm really starting to notice a difference in my whole face. The eye cream has been taking away my dark circles and it's starter to look smoother around my eyes. Mind you, these products didn't work over night after a few weeks you will start to see a difference. So don't give up after a few days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this product, it goes on smooth and it's not overly greasy. I use it every night after I wash my face. You don't need to use a lot because a little goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this product to others! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think it likely cost more than its worth. I expected alot more from a loreal product. It felt nice but I didn't see much if any result. Maybe it was just me and others will have a better reaction. But this just isn't for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream worked really well for me. The cream applied smoothly and absorbed easily. I was also happy that the fragrance was not overpowering. I've been using it for over 2 weeks and notice that the skin is brighter and more hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream every day and night for the past week and I can already see a huge difference! I used to have deepening fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and it was especially bad after waking up and it would last through the day. Now I don't have to worry about it as long as I use this cream before bedtime and after I wash my face in the morning. It's so wonderful and I will use this forever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the RevitaLift eye cream it is gentle on your skin and I notice a difference in the brightness of my skin. The texture and smell is also pleasant. I will keep using this cream to see if the skin around my eyes seem any firmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product has a nice feel and nice fragrance to it. It goes on evenly and is not greasy. I notice improvement in my skin's elasticity and it's definitely not as dry. Fine lines are suttlely improving. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the L'Oréal Paris Eye cream with doubts in my head. I began my two week trail thinking I would not see any difference, but I was wrong! The fine lines around my eyes are less noticeable, the dark circles I had are almost gone, and the skin around my eyes feel tighter and seem to have more lift. It feels good on my skin, it is not greasy, and smells pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the eye creme for several days. There was no medical issue beforehand but even the first day my eyes watered. The reaction increased daily with nasal problems as well. Until I stopped the product. Within two days my watery eyes were dry and my nose stopped running. L'Oréal is a good name but even good products have some people allergic to them--I guess I am one of them [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the L'oreal anti- wrinkle and firming eye cream and I feel although it showed and provided a great deal of moisture, I didn't really see a difference as far as wrinkles of firming. I did love the fact that it made my skin feel like I was doing it a favor! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Eye Cream is nice and firm. It feels amazing on my face. It is sensitive enough to not cause any damage to my eye area. I could feel the product working on my face. I think it does exactly what it says it will do. I love using this product and will continue to purchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am a sucker for eye cream and I am a strong believer if you are gonna use anything it needs to be eye cream. This one seems to be pretty good. It's not super oily and not too thick. It goes on great and blends in well. Your eye skins feels tight and smooth after. I've been using for about 3 weeks now and think my eyes look great and a little bit goes a long way. I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye cream is a fabulous product. I have used it the past 2 weeks and love the results. I have tried many other creams and this one is by far the best. It goes on smooth and silky and blends well into my skin. It doesnt leave a heavy feeling. I think this is a great product for any kind of skin. I have combination skin and it works great for me. I highly recommend this product to all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So far so good! Especially this time of year - the skin around my eyes gets extremely dried out and looks wrinkled. Since using the firming eye cream, they are not getting dried out and I feel like my skin is really glistening. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product it is so ease to disolve on skin, it made the dark spots I had under my eyes lighter. Minimize the bag I had under the eye. i really like this product. I recommend it if your looking to dismiss dark spot & bags under the eye. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Have been using this product for about 3 weeks now and I love it. It has helped with""crow's feet"" and puffiness under eyes. It feels great going on and has not irritated my quite sensitive eyes. Definitely will recommend to others [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream (0.5 oz) works really well. I have been using it for a couple of weeks and my eyes look brighter and younger.

"I am 50 years old, but am lucky to have skin that still thinks it's younger. This eye cream is light enough for my skin, but still effective in reducing the fine lines around my eyes. I love it and will not go out without using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a pretty decent product. It was easy to apply, smells good and isn't oily after application. I don't really see a decrease in fine lines yet, but it's only been about 3 weeks. My skin definitely feels and looks better, though. You don't really need to know anything before trying this product. I have pretty sensitive skin and I didn't have any problems.

Now that I have been using this eye cream for over a week I can really see results. The wrinkles around my eyes aren't as noticeable. The dark circles are starting to fade and the puffiness is gone! I have been bzzing to everyone I know! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been fighting age lines under my eyes for 3 years. I have tried many different products, but with no real results, so I gave up and decided just to live with it. After using the L'Oreal Eye Cream for 3 weeks I felt like I was looking better. Then one night, out of the blue, my husband looked at me and said, ""Wow. What have you been doing? Your eyes look amazing. "" I was so floored that he noticed I teared up a bit. This stuff really produces results-- [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This eye cream was exciting to use, I didn't realize I had a problem under my eyes until I saw a difference. Having no scent for this area was also appreciated.

"I'm enjoying the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream quite a bit. It's one of the higher rated eye creams without dropping a lot of bucks for it, and I'm quite optimistic that it's improving the looks of things. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very sensitive eyes and the L'Oréal Revitalift Anti-wrinkle and Firming eye cream hasn't irritated them at all. I have noticed a slight difference in some fine lines around my eyes. Being in my 30s, I am looking to prevent some aging and this is great for that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use a lot of high end skin care. This has been a better product than many that cost several times the cost. I have notices lessening of fine lines and definite tightening of the bagginess I have had for years! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love the anti wrinkle + firming eye cream! It really works great! I can't believe how it helped with the bags under my eyes and the crows feet! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has these issues! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the Revitalift Anti Wrinkle + firming Eye Cream for the past week and a half and I can see a difference in the puffiness and winkles under my eyes. I also feel as though it is helping with the dark circles I normally have in the mornings under my eyes. The cream feels silky to the touch not oily or greasy to the skin. can't wait to see the difference in a months time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am already using Arbonne's under eye refresher, but have added the Firming Eye Cream to my daily/nightly regimine as well. My skin looks and feels very soft, since beginning this routine 3 weeks ago. I hope to continue to improve my skin's appearance and health. I only use a dab under each eye and I think this product will last for at least 2 more months. The smell is pleasant and feels cool on my skin. No complaints here! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried lots of different eye creams and this one is very good! It is creamy and goes on smooth. It is easy to wear under make-up too. It feels good on your eye (less dry and absorbs quickly). Many eye creams cause my eyes to be irritated or be itchy, but not this one. I even put it on my upper eyelid (below the brow). It really helped smooth and hide the fine lines in this area too. Best of all, this product really works! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The eye cream is my favorite product in the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle line. I use the cream at night and also in the morning. The cream is smooth and not oily compared to some eye creams I have use. )The weightlessness reminds me of some gels that I have used.) This is great because it does not irritate my sensitive eyes and I can wear it under make up! Plus, little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved L'Oreal Paris Revitalift anti Wrinkle and Firming Eye Cream. I use it every single day after I get out of the shower. I love the way it fills, Soft silky smooth. It is amazing.

"This was my favorite product out of all four provided. I really feel that it made my skin smooth and in turn reduced lines, wrinkles and areas of age/stress. Did it remove the problem areas completely? No, but that should be an expectation for an over the counter, reasonably priced product. It does what it claims to do and is very easy to use.

I wake up in the mornings with puffy eyes. I used this and within minutes the puffiness was gone. I will definitely continue using this product in the future and recomend it to friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think i found the best eye cream for my dark circles and, crow's feet... Thank you for the chance to try this. Without trying,I would not have found Loreal RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle +Firming Eye Cream. And thanl you BuzzAgent too! My husband even noticed a difference in the wrinkle reduction. Im happy!

I think RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream is a great addition to my beauty routine. I almost immediately noticed a difference in the color and puffiness under my eyes. With continued use more improvement is being seen. This product is the most satisfying under eye cream I have used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this eye cream. It goes on so easy and it leaves my skin looking conditioned and soft. I definitely had a problem with dry, wrinkled skin before I started using this but no more. I used this in conjunction with the face and neck cream and the night cream. The container is also very nice, I can sit it on my counter without having to look at an eye sore. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been looking for an eye cream so this came at the perfect time! I put it on every night before bed (if I dont forget). I have noiced a slight difference in the fine lines smooothing out and feeling softer underneath and to the sides. 4 stars becasue i feel like it will take a couple months before you will really be able to tell a big difference.

I love the revitalization anti wrinkle firming eye cream I have been using the eye cream everyday Since I have been using it I see an amazing difference underneath my eyes First of all it's not Greasy so u can put make up over it without smearing. My eyes no more have bags and smoothed it out wonderfully. Hands up tonthis product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this eye cream for the last 3 weeks and although I did have a few wrinkles they weren't something that bothered me too much. I have noticed an improvement and have seen the wrinkles become less noticeable. Light scent and goes on smoothly and a little bit goes a long way. Overall a good product that I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Of the set of RevitaLift creams I have seen the best results with the eye cream. First of all a little bit goes a very long way. Since using this my eyes definitely don't seem as puffy. I'm 32 and don't have wrinkles but I do have some fine lines around the inner corners of my eyes that also seem way less visible. Like the other creams it goes on smoothly and absorbs pretty fast. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using RevitaLift Eye Cream twice a day for a couple of weeks I am seeing fine lines diminishing. There's barely a scent and I don't smell anything once I apply it. As long as it keeps the fine lines at bay, I'm good with it. I will continue using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In my opinion I do not feel this eye cream made a difference. It feels nice, but the dark circles and bags remain the same. I was also using the night cream, but decreased my use to every other night as it was too greasy for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream has a soft scent, fragrance free. I wear contacts and it doesn't bother me like other creams do. It feels smooth and light going on and feels weightless on my skin! Loving this eye cream!!! I have two babies under two and thought the dark circles were there to stay but this L'Oréal revitalize anti-wrinkle + firming cream made them almost disappear!!!

This eye cream soothed and solved my eye area problems. The crepey eyelids and the dark skin are gone after 2 weeks use. It was light in texture and scent. Nice to use a product that really works for a change! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that after using this eye cream that it has helped my eye area feel firmer and have a few less wrinkles. It helps with my problem of very dry skin to keep the skin softer which helps with the wrinkles. I believe this is a great product and will continue to purchase so I don't lose any changes to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the Revilift anti wrinkle and firming eye cream and LOVED it! It helped with the wrinkles under my eyes, and the ""tired"" look that I usually have in the mornings. i love it and it will be a part of my normal morning routine from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't really have crows feet around my eyes per say, but I did notice the skin as being more stretchy in that area. I wanted to try the firming eye cream as a preventative to crows feet and it worked wonderfully. The skin around my eyes is much more firmer and hydrated after using for only 2 weeks. I can't even imagine what the results after 4 or 6 weeks would be. I'm going to continue using the product, because I really like the results I got. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As a gal who has tried many different brands of eye cream, I feel confident in stating this is one of the best. The lotion is lightweight and absorbs in quickly. In the past I've found eye cream has a tendancy to work itself into my eyes, ouch! Not a problem here, the lotion stayed put. Made for nice primer on the off chance I used eyeshadow as well. Seemed to reduce puffiness under my eye, and definitely leaves a radiance to my cheekbones. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have always hated the deep lines around my eyes...not only because they are very noticeable...but also prevents me from wearing makeup because it makes it look even worse. Since i have tried the L'oreal firming eye cream i notice the lines are a little less noticeable and that makes me a bit more confident in the way i look!! I will continue using and hopefully notice even more change!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'OREAL eye cream has enhanced the area around my eyes. My skin has become smooth. soft and vibrant. The depth of my smile creases is less, leaving the appearance of younger looking eyes. L'OREAL eye cream is definitely worth a try. My husband says' ""Hey good lookin'."" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm on my 30 and I think is time to have care of my eyes area. And I was trying this eye cream for a couple a weeks and I really love. Firm skin, and reduces dark circles. I feel my skin smoother and I saw less wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this eye cream! After using the firming eye cream for 3 weeks my mom asked what face products I was using because my eyes were looking fresh and youthful and I got carded at a bar. I hadn't gotten carded in years! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is one of the best eye creams I have ever used. It is not greasy and just glides on your face. It is rich and you can feel your skin absorbing the moisture from this cream. Honestly my wrinkles didn't seem to improve, but they didn't get any worse. Loved this cream and would recommend highly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's a nice light cream that goes on easy. It's a small jar but a little bit definitely goes a long way. It smells like regular lotion and absorbs pretty quickly. After a couple weeks of use the area around my eyes looks smoother and not as tired looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This soft smooth cream helped with revitalizing and smoothing out the fine tired lines around the eyes. It goes well under makeup and at night as your daily face cleanse and moisturizer routine. I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

There was no irritation to my sensitive skin either I would recommend this to all my friends [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ive tried many eye creams throughout the years and this is one of the better ones. It goes on creamy yet not greasy and it got absorbed very fast. By the time I put my moisturizer on the eye cream was absorbed. I like how it went on. I haven't used it long enough to know whether it actually helps with wrinkle or firmness but I like the texture so I will keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As a mom, sleep is overrated. With work, kids, pets, family and more, there are just not enough hours in the day to get the sleep you need. As a result of this, dark circles and bags under the eyes appear and are hard to get rid of. I used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream and within a week noticed the bags starting to disappear. I continued to use it and the raccoon eyes actually got lighter and I look like I sleep great. I have younger looking eyes now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream is exactly what every Mom needs! The dark eye bags are the worst, and mom's can't escape them. But this cream diminishes the darkness and makes your eyes look brighter and more awake! Definitely a must have for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a very nice light eye cream. I use it at night before I go to bed to allow it to soak in well, without putting makeup over it. I've been using it for 2 1/2 weeks now and I notice a difference in the skin around my eyes, it seems softer and the fine lines are much less noticeable! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to reduce bags or lines around their eyes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a very non greasy formula. It made my eyes feel so amazing. I did notice a lessening of fine lines around my eyes. Did not bother or irritate my eyes at all. I felt like it helped my tired eyes relax. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I did not like that you had to use a separate cream for your eyes, prefer and all in one product. Was unable to use long enough to notice a difference in my eyes after using.

I've tried many eye creams and I have to say I was impressed with this. It's been about 3 weeks now and the puffiness in the morning has definitely improved. Works better than some of the more expensive products I've tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love how this product takes care of those under eye bags, dark circles and any other item that is just plain annoying. It only takes a little bit and your set. The texture is a great non-greasy formula that is easy to apply and lasts a long time. My face looks younger and I feel it as well. I love all those compliments I have been getting from many of my friends and co-workers. Perfect for everyday use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very light, smooth, low fragrance. The skin absorbs the non greasy lotion quickly. I have been using the entire regiment for about three weeks now. There has been a subtle change in the appearance of fine lines under my eyes. I'm looking forward to more changes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I never thought after using this cream for over a week people would notice a difference, but I was completely wrong. I received compliments from my kids, husband, friends and coworkers. It is great to see such results. I would purchase this product again and recommend to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am an stay at home mom to two (almost 3) kids. All my time is focused on them. I am tired and my eyes show that. I was excited to try something to help with the wrinkles around the corners and to firm up the under side of my tired eyes. I however have not noticed much of an difference at all. The cream smells really good and it goes on very smooth. It is not greasy or watery. It just does not seem to help with my tired eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I always feel self conscience about the puffiness under my eyes.i just hate it.so when I received RevitaLift firming eye cream I was thrilled to try it out.Ive been using it for a few weeks now and have truely seen a difference.my eyes have less of a puffy look .i never forget my eye cream now because it works!

"Now this one is the most effective of all so far. I've noticed a huge change in my eye contour already. I always have baggy eyes that make it look like I didn't get any sleep the night before and it was frequently embarrassing with people asking me too many personal questions to make sure I was fine. With this product, it looks like I've gotten sufficient sleep and I look like I have more energy. Feeling good about myself creates energy too! Definite must-try product.

"I was skeptical at first but after having used the product for a few weeks now, I would recommend using RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream. The product feels light weight and doesn't feel thick or greasy. I don't believe a few weeks is long enough to tell if there have been any permanent results but I will continue to use it regularly as a moisturizer.

"At age 63, I have been trying different eye creams for over 15 years and haven't found 'The one' yet that showed improvement with firming. The RevitaLift eye cream is a lovely, thick, butter-like cream that goes on so smooth. I think because it does keep the eye area super moisturized and soft, that it would definitely prevent fine lines and wrinkles. After using it only three weeks, I feel with longer use I'll see the results of firming. I will stay with this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for one week. I began applying it as soon as I received it. I need to wait longer to see results. I kind of notice dark circle disappearing but need to wait longer. I like how there is no odor to the cream and applies smoothly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"In trying Loreal Eye Cream, I was not able to continue with the use of this product. As soon as I placed the cream around the area of my eye, my eyes immediately started watering. It may be a fabulous product but my eyes are too sensitive to know how well it could work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. I have been using it a little over a week now and have seen a difference in the texture of the skin around my eyes. Its not greasy and is light on your skin. I use it during the day under my makeup and alone at night. Also, find the price fair and accessible to most. Happy girl here! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
While I have super sensitive eyes....and this makes them water....the benefit of smoother skin versus more crows feet far outweighs my issue. Very light and does not have an overpowering scent; which I very much appreciate. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream to try through BzzAgent. I absolutely love this cream. It goes on smoothly, is lightweight, and absorbs quickly.

"The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream my favorite of the products I've tried. It causes no irritation which is especially important in such a delicate area. I've noticed definite improvement after using it a few weeks - the dark circles are nowhere near as prominent. As someone who rarely wears makeup, this is important to me.

I have been trying the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream day and night for 2 weeks now. I really like this product. I can see a reduction in the wrinkles around my eyes. The area under and around my eyes looks brighter. You only need to use a scant amount of the cream to go around your eyes and it is absorbed very quickly.

I have been having problems with dryness under my eyes and this very much so helped with the dryness. It added moisture and also a subtle sheen to my under eye area. It also made the area very soft.

I felt a burning sensation on my face when I applied around my eyes. It also smelled overly floral and unnecessarily scented. All moisturizers for the face should have NO SCENT AND MINIMAL INGREDIENTS. I would never buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After using this product for two weeks I was very happy with the results. I used it at night and had noticabily smoother skin. I suffer from dark puffy circles under my eyes and this product reduced the puffiness and brightened my skin. I was need less makeup in the morning now as a result of this product. I recommed if you are looking to reduce puffiness and want smoother skin in the eye area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Now this is a product I will buy. The dark circles under my eyes are far less noticeable and much smoother. I would definitely recommend anyone trying this. It only takes a little to do the trick and I have found if you use a cotton swab it is much easier to apply. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked this product. I liked the way it felt on my skin and its not greasy or thick. It absorbs into your skin nicely. I have very dry skin and I have been using this product on my eyes.

I had the opportunity to try this. I love it. I've been using for about 3 weeks and I noticed results with the first 10 days! It's amazing how the wrinkles around my eyes are slowly diminishing.

"I will start by how much I like how soft my eye area feels and I've noticed that I don't wake up with as much water fluid ""bags"" under my eyes. The one problem I have is that my eyes feel tired. I've never noticed it with any other eye cream before. I first thought it was allergies but it has been a few weeks now. That's the only complaint I have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this cream because my face was definitely more moisturized. I even looked more awake now. It feels good to spoil myself a little by taking care of my face including my eye area. It's definitely important not to neglect it. Looking brighter and awake makes you look younger too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oreal Paris RivitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream will not disappoint! I wasn't really sure if anything would help the little wrinkles around my eyes but just after a couple of days I started noticing the difference.

"Great product. Very light consistency so goes on very easily without ""tugging"" on the sensitive skin around your eyes. Non greasy and was able to apply my eye makeup afterwards without smudging and having it run down my face...always a plus! I've noticed some reduction in the fine lines around my lids and under eye area. I'm sure this will continue to improve over time with continued use.

"I was really excited to try this cream since I have very dark circles that nothing seems to fix. I haven't seen any noticeable difference in the dark circles, but I have only been using the cream for about three weeks (it states it takes about 4 weeks to start seeing diminished circles), so I will continue to use and see what happens. I do have to say that he skin under my eyes does appear to be smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle and Firming Eye Cream for a few weeks now. I absolutely love how soft my skin feels under my eyes. I feel like my circles and wrinkles disappeared a little.

"I have actually tried all 4 RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle Firming creams. I have been using them for about 2 weeks now. I was so worried that with my sensitive skin I would get a rash or zits with all the creams but nothing. I also don't have the oily feel on my face when i put them on. I use them every day and I can see a slight difference. I will probably see more the more I use them. I would totally recommend this product, in fact i already have. Best product I have tried so far.

"After using this cream a few times, I can say that I am seeing a little bit of a difference as far as ""depuffing"" under my eyes. My skin is moisturized around my eyes. I don't have wrinkles around my eyes yet to know if it works in that aspect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The eye cream really helped with my dark under eye circle. It is great how light and absorbable the cream is. It has a nice gel like consistency with make it cooling to put on. It's spreadable so I don't need to tug at my delicate eye area. And because of the retinol-a, I am hoping to see the fine lines in deminish. But in the mean time, I am enjoying putting this light jelly pack under my eyes every night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is such an amazing eye cream! Both my mother & I tried the Revitalift anti-wrinkle + firming eye cream and both she & I are very impressed. She did applied hers at night , while I applied it both at night as well as before applying my makeup for the day. We both saw a difference within 7 days, my difference was a bit more. I'm pleased to say we both plan on adding this to our permanent routines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoy using the eye cream. The cream is a nice thick texture. The smell is pleasant and overbearing.

"I've only had the cream for a little over a week, and I was expecting at least a small change in the skin under my eyes. No one notices anything looking different, at least, not yet. Perhaps it takes longer than a week of use for results. The cream goes on smooth, though it does feel slightly greasy. The smell is ok too. Thank you for letting me give it a go!

I really love this product. I have tried it for two weeks now. I have felt a difference in two days. I received my L'ORÉAL Revitalift Anti Wrinkle and Firming Face Cream one week ago. I've been using it every morning. The cream is wonderful! It feels like silk on my skin! The eye cream is not greasy nor tacky. It absorbs right away!

I plan on using this product from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My eyes are shinning bright again! L'Oréal's Firming Eye Cream is really amazing. The biggest problem I have with eye creams is that they make my eyes water. I have been using it day and night for 2 1/2 weeks, and I haven't got tears in my eyes. The crows feet are diminishing, and my eyes look great! It also works really well for a base to make up.

I really loved the eye cream because I specifically saw a change in my dark circles after using this product consistently for several days. The reason I could not rank it higher is because I did have some eye irritation from using the cream. I will continue to use it but probably once a day instead of twice.

I'm amazed that I have already began to see a difference in the skin around my eyes. I have less fine wrinkles and I think the darker circles around my eyes have lightened. I'm excited to see what kind of differences I will see by using the product for longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the eye cream, it isn't super greasy and you don't need a whole lot for it to do its job effectively. I use it everyday and am very pleased with the results, its something that I would definitely recommend to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this product for over a week now. I have already noticed the difference in the firmness around my eyes. It does not have a strong odor like other products similar to it. I am anxious to see how much better it will work over the coming weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Love this eye cream. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and it looks like I barely touched it. U just need a tiny dab and it retains its moisture all day and all night to help lessen the effects of wrinkles [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The eye cream is very light and moist. I can feel relief in around my eyes as soon as I apply it. I use it with the night cream as well as the day cream. I have definitely noticed a softening of wrinkles around my eyes and the tired look is gone. I'm looking forward to continuing to use the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream.

"I tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream for about two weeks. I never thought I'd say I love a moisturizer but seriously- this stuff is amazing! I have always had an issue with puffy eyes but after two weeks of using this stuff, no more bags! I would definitely recommend to those with under eye baggage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this eye cream. Noticed a difference right away. After one use the puff black bags under my eyes where smaller and less dark within 10 mins of using the eye cream. As the week has gone on I have noticed the bags and darkness under my eyes are very slight. I will keep using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this eye cream for about two weeks now. It hasn't been long enough to really tell if it's firming my eye area much yet, but I do feel like I can tell a slight difference. I also enjoy the refreshing feeling it has when I apply it. I hope to see more results in the weeks to come! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I normally do not use an eye cream but I have to say this was great. I can't tell any results yet but It does feel buttery smooth when applying. I will keep everyone updated its only been 1 week since i began. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I can tell it's already working and using all the products together I am firm believer now. I will be sure to tell all my friends and family about what a great product it is. And hope others will run out and get it today. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Unfortunately, I have not had much time to use this eye cream before submitting a review. I haven't noticed any significant benefits in wrinkle reduction around my eyes yet, but am hoping to as I use this longer. I can say that the eye cream is gentle, and provides great moisture to my eyes. In the past I have had reactions to eye creams on my eye lids, and I have not had any negative side effects with L'Oreal Paris Eye Cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product smells and feel great, but so far I am not getting any results. Maybe I am too expressive and my crinkles and crepy skin is difficult to firm? I am not giving up yet! Possibly I need more than 4 weeks to attack these lines to the point that I notice. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have applied this eye cream for the past 3 days. I like the thickness and the texture. I don't see any real Ganges however I think over time I'm going to feel good about using an eye cream and I think this one will be a good one! It makes me feel like I'm doing something good for the thirsty skin around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This eye cream is sensational I use it two times a day, in the morning and before sleep. I see the difference about a week using the cream. Is no sticky, no odor, is a light cream. If you are looking for a cream that really work I recommend this Loreal Revitalift EyeCream, this cream really works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this eye cream has been a great added item in my beauty routine. I have allergies and things are getting hectic with the holidays. So I know I'm looking very tired lately. I few dabs of this under my eyes and it feels less puffy and more awake. I also like to stick it in my fridge for a cool feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this product as directed around the eye area, but did not notice any noticeable difference in my eye area. It also made my eyes red and watery, and they stayed irritated for some time after application. I would not recommend this product to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"No desired results so far, but my eye area can be quite sensitive and has so far been just fine with this product. Hoping to see a reduction in dark circles soon! Suggested it to my boyfriend as well, who has dark circles he's eager to see diminish and equally sensitive skin around the eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a good moisurizer. I didn't have a chance to use it long enough to notice any firming, but I did notice it moisturizer my skin. I am not crazy about the smell, but I am pregnant and have super sensitive smell. Overall great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this anti wrinkle, firming eye cream more than I ever thought I would! I used to use a premium product for a premium price and still did not see the results I have seen on this in just 3 weeks! It feels smooth and light on my skin. I definitely recommend this to anyone who asks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It says that it takes 4 weeks to show improvement and I haven't had 4 weeks yet so haven't seen much difference yet. I do like the cream though. A little seems to go a long way. It also doesn't make my face greasy which is a huge plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Definitely has helped with my dark circles. I have 2 young children, so sleep is not in my vocabulary very much. But since using this cream twice a day, I definitely see it helping. They definitely aren't gone but are not as dark [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE this cream. Over the past few weeks I have seen the most noticeable changes around my eyes. A hug reduction in under eyes bags and crows feet. It smells great, and does not leave a greasy feel like some of the other creams. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not sold on the firming eye cream. I've been using it for about 3 weeks and see no change. The cream is a nice consistency. You only need a little, it goes a long way. I do think its helps soften and moisturize the eye area, but no noticeable firming. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the product for almost 3 weeks. I loved the eye cream cream it does not make your pores feel clogged or make your skin feel oily. It has a nice fragrance and it did seem to help with the wrinkles. I will keep using the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It does a very good job for moisturizing my eyes, but I didn't see a result for firming the skin under my eyes. I have been using it for 2 weeks FYI. I would say it is a good eye cream for its price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Revitalift eye cream is a light cream that goes on gently. I like how it makes my skin feel but haven't been able to tell much difference yet in the firmness around my eye area. Adds a nice layer of moisture around the eye area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this eye cream for straight two weeks now and I see some changes in the wrinkles under my eye. It started to diminish little by little. As first, i felt the burning sensation of my eyes, but it is tolerable. So I stopped using it for a day and went back using it again and doesn't bother me anymore. I used it twice a day to see the result. I'm giving it a month of use to see what else this eye cream can do. For the meantime, I'm satisfied to what I'm getting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the eye cream not as directed (only once in the morning) for two weeks and it seems to make no difference to my skin. A tiny dab goes a long way though! Even with reading the package instructions, I'm a little unsure where I'm suppose to apply the cream. I'll continue to try to product for the recommend 4 weeks to see if I have better results, but I'm sure I'd have better results if I used it twice a day as directed.

"Even though I have not been using this product very long, I like what I see happening around my eyes. The lines have become visibly less noticeable and the puffiness is disappearing. I use RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream both morning and night after I go through my cleansing routine. I will continue to use this cream in hopes that it continues to ""heal"" my eye area. I love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the consistency I f this cram. It is thick and light l it goes on well with no greasy after effect. The cream seemed to help my under eye puffiness alot. It also minimized the dark circles. I do, however wish it had a different scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product for two weeks and have not noticed an improvement in the dark circle under my eyes yet. I have noticed the skin under my eyes is more hydrated. Results are supposed to be noticeable after four weeks so I will continue to use this product and see if the dark circles fade. I wish this product came in a tube rather than a small jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Loved that this eye cream did not cause my eyes to water or feel irritated in any way. I use this in the morning after my shower and it helps to reduce puffiness and my crows feet are not as noticeable. It absorbs easily into my skin without feeling greasy and my eye make-up goes on easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have sensitive eyes, so it's really hard for me to find an eye cream that suits me, but with that one It is really a miral, with its moisturizing no perfume formula I can use it every day without any problem [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This eye cream has given me fantastic results. I've been using it for a week straight now and I can honestly say that the skin under my eyes looks healthier, firmer and younger. I don't even have to use my undereye concealer anymore! I'm in love with my results. Thanks BzzAgent and L'Oreal ❤❤ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"One of the areas that I feel really shows my age is the puffy area under my eyes. Since I've begun using the Revitalift Eye Cream, The puffiness has definitely been reduced and I feel like the skin has been rejuvenated. No one tells me that I'm looking tired anymore! One other plus about these products is that I love the scent. It has a nice smell without being overpowering. I am so glad it doesn't have a medicine like smell! Do far, so good with these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I see a small difference after 2 weeks of using each morning & night. I am happy with the result (which I didn't notice until I looked act my before and after pics) My skin is firmer. I like the cream. It's not too oily. It smells great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked this product. I liked the way it felt on my skin and its not greasy or thick. It absorbs into your skin nicely. I have very dry skin and I have been using this product on my eyes. I feel like my eyes look brighter and the skin feels tighter. I have also noticed a decrease in the darkness under my eyes. I am very happy with this product and will purchase again in the future.

L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream (0.5 oz) has become a new luxury in my skincare regimen. A little goes a long way and absorbs nicely around the eye area without any greasy residue after each application. I have been applying this product twice a day morning and night with ring finger patting in a gentle motion. The results have revealed a firmer more youthful appearance. Will continue this product everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream for about two weeks now, and it works like a charm on puffiness and dark circles. I actually went out in public sans makeup for the first time in years! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I generally don't use a lot of product; I've been blessed with good skin. However, I thought this would be an interesting product to try. I've been trying the entire suite of L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Anti Wrinkle + Firming creams and have been impressed so far. My skin feels very moisturized and the eye cream helps me to look not so tired! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for two weeks now but the photo I am providing is after using the product for one week. I have tried many eye creams but this is the first time I have seen results right away. They aren't drastic results but you can see a difference in the fine lines around my eyes. I am excited I found something that really works. I will definitely be recommending this product to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream is really working on my under eye bags. Didn't believe it was possible but I am proof. The older I'm getting the worse it was and now it is in reverse. This is after only 3 weeks of using day and night. Love, Love Love this product. Received it free and now I will always buy and use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As I have gotten older I have gotten puffy purplish slightly swollen under eyes that crinkle with lines. Not bad but you can really tell the difference after using this product. Firming has reduced the swelling and smoothed the winkling while diminishing the purple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the lightness of this eye cream.i will have use for awhile to see is it helps with wrinkles. I like that there is a light fragrance. I am highly allergic to alot of products for eyes and get spots usually but not with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although I don't have any wrinkles , this product I find is a great product for skin moisturizing. I like the jar it comes in and the smell. I like that you can apply it to your face as a moisturizer as well as your eyes. I also think the price is a reasonable and affordable price . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this under eye cream for a week and am already seeing results! It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. The jar looks small but I think it should last at least a month. So excited about this! As a mom of three, if one little jar can help me look less haggard and more rested, I am all for it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"By now i have used all products as suggested. Like the feel of the eye cream, truthfully have never used one before. Use face cream and that is it. Would i buy it , truthfully do not know. Will see. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the eye cream, and I absolutely love it. I like that it is not greasy and that it has a pleasant smell. Being a stay home mom of three very active kids, I am constantly sporting dark circles under my eyes. While using this product for the last few weeks I have noticed a significant change under and around my eyes. This product works and I would recommend this to everyone.

"I love this eye cream! The texture is super light and silky - it absorbs *immediately.* I have been using the eye-cream for the last several weeks as part of the RevitaLift regime and have been really happy with the results. As a Greek-American, I often wake up with dark circles under my eyes. Since using the eye-cream, my eyes seem brighter and more ""awake"" seeming. I plan to definitely keep this eye cream as part of my day & night skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used L'Oréal products for years and thought I would try their special eye cream. The product is for circles under the eyes and wrinkles. After using it for several weeks I did not notice any difference. The cream went on well and was soothing but didn't help me at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very impressed with the immediate results I noticed from the eye cream. After just a couple of applications, I noticed firmer, brighter skin. I just recently Turned 40, and don't really have a skin care routine, and lately have become more concerned about fine lines and wrinkles, especially around the eye area. I am absolutely going to continue to use this product, and re-evaluate the results after using longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how it make my eye look after I been using it. It made my eye look healthy and firmer. My eyes look so much better and no bags like mark under my eyes anymore. It goes on so easy and it smell so good too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first started using the eye cream, I liked it because it was smooth. And, I will say it goes on easy. However, over time, I have noted that it doesn't dry completely unless I wipe it with a tissue. If I don't do this, it gets on my glasses, and interferes with my vision until I wash my glasses once or twice. As far as any permanent results, I haven't yet seen any. But, as with all the other products, it has a great scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am so thrilled with the results. I especially love the Firming Face & Neck Contour Cream. I like the way my skin just soaks up the Creams ~ all of them, no greasy cream left on skin like other products. This set is a win/win for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As a chronic fatigue sufferer, it's common for me to have ""tired eyes"". After using this product for only 6 days, I noticed a remarkable change. Not only did I notice, but so did my family! I was asked ""wow, are you finally getting good sleep?"" The puffiness and black circles under my eyes had almost seemed to disappear! Love this product and will be using it daily!

Wonderful. Uplifting. Smooth. This is my favorite eye Cream. I have been using it now for over a week. Was not too certain on the product at first but the more I used it the more I love it. Makes my skin feel so much smoother and brighter. It's even lessening some of the crows feet around my I And a cute small glass jar. The look of the jar makes it feel more expensive. Also this cream has little to no scent. Which I like that part of it. I'm not big on scented creams [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have a small wrinkle line on the side of my left eye and this has made it less noticeable. I've really enjoyed using it, a little goes a long way so the jar would last a while. I just dislike that it doesn't come with a spoon to scoop out the product, I don't really like using jars I prefer pumps. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Revitalift Eye Cream is a great product. I don't tend to buy separate eye creams so I was excited to try this one. It's silky and absorbs nicely and it does not irritate or burn the sensitive eye area. I am noticing a difference in the fine lines under my eyes in just a couple weeks time! Will definitely continue using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product only two weeks and I can't tell much of a difference. It is supposed to firm your skin and I'm sure if I could use it for about three months, it might help. I do like the way it makes my skin feel, but that is about all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a fine eye cream. It melts nicely into the eye area and does not cause any problems with applying my eye makeup on top afterwards. I have not noticed a huge difference in the condition of my eye area, but it has only been a couple weeks. It does have a scent that is bit strong for my liking, which makes my eyes sometimes sensitive. I would have preferred an unscented eye cream instead.

"Using this product has made a world of difference! I tend to have dark circles under my eyes and always look tired. Well, I am, I have 2 little ones at home. Lol.

One week into using L'Oreal Paris Revital anti wrinkle +Firming eye cream and I'm starting to see and feel a difference . This may be my favorite product out of the anti wrinkle + firming line . There is no strong order to the cream and Since day one I could feel it working. It's also gentle on the delicate eye area . I'm loving the results and can wait to see the results after four weeks . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this is going to be one of my favorite products from now on. This eye cream goes on smoothly and absorbs in very quickly. This is important to me because the easier it is to go on the less I have to dab into my delicate eye area. This cream also does not have an irratating odor like some products I have tried before. My eye area looks a little less dry after a few uses. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this eye cream for a couple of weeks and am loving it so far. My skin is sensitive so a lot of eye creams leave the area around my eye really greasy, but this eye cream doesn't. It absorbs pretty quickly. I haven't seen any changes as far as wrinkles or fine lines, but I'll keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At my age, the skin around the eyes starts to get dry. Eye shadow doesn't go on the way it used to. Good eye creams are very expensive. L'Oreal eye cream works, in my opinion, just as good. Goes on smooth and melts right in. Smells good too. Has a very light smell, almost none, which is what I like. Will finish this product out to see the difference in my skin around the eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product states that it produces smoother, firmer skin in 4 weeks. I used it for 1 week and I can see already my skin around the eyes a little firmer. It has a smooth non-greasy texture and is very easy to apply. I definitely will use this cream in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this eye cream for two weeks, I've noticed that the skin around my eyes is softer. This makes applying makeup easier, with less pulling and creasing (which is especially important as you get older). The cream is easy to apply, doesn't take very much, and doesn't have the strong smell that other products in this line have. This cream is definitely in the ""purchase again"" column.

"After 2 weeks, the little wrinkles around my eyes are gone. This is great stuff! Several of my friends have noticed the difference and I told them about the Revitalift products I've been using. The ladies at my Wednesday class are impressed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is really great as a moisturizer. It made my skin feel soft and smooth. It smells nice, which is a plus. But I didn't see much in the way of my skin being tightened. It didn't really make much of a difference in my skin at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do not feel like this has done much for me except moisturize some. I have not yet noticed a difference in wrinkles, dark circles or puffiness. I will continue to use this to see if I notice a difference after a couple more weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product for a week and I must say I did see a difference in wrinkles around my eye. They were less noticeable and the cream also helped relieve the dark circles under my eyes. The cream was thick and not too thin. The smell in my opinion was quite pleasant. It had a male musky scent to it. I will keep trying it to see it it still works but so far so good [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used Loreal Revitalift Eye Cream and I actually am seeing fewer lines around my eyes. I find that a little bit goes a long way. Too much and it is way too greasy. That little jar should last a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream for 10 days and realize my eyes are watering all morning. I think it's too strong for me. It smells great and blends in well when e I did my makeup. I love the cool feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It is a good moisturizer and I will continue to use it. I have only been using it for week and a half but have not seen any difference in the few wrinkles around my eyes yet. Though I really don't have deep wrinkles yet either. The instructions say you will see a change in 4 weeks so I will continue to use it to see if there is a difference. However, it is a good moisturizer. It is not greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Im so pleased with the results of this product it's amazing what it has done for my wrinkles around my eyes they are gone i feel 10 years younger this product has lifted the skin around my eyes and took away the puffiness and dark circles that i had before if anyone has the same problems that i had before i had used this product i recommend that you give this product a try it's a great product and it really works.

"The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream glides on so beautifully & it felt so great on a delicate skin area, it smelled very pleasant too some are strong chemical scented so the fresh scent was a nice bonus.

L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream feels light and goes on smooth. It doesn't make my skin have an oily filling and pairs good with other products in the same line. There is great results in the puffiness under my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great product. Light and easy on the brow and under eye. Will make this product a regular part of my daily facial ritual. absorbs very quickly. I have to admit it was hard switching from the products I use regularly but once I got started it was great. I'm totally impressed and amazed at how well my facial skin looks. This is truly a wonderful product. I will definitely purchase the RevitaLift products once my jars are empty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using all four of L'Oreal's firming creams, and they work wonders! I am on week two, and my skin is unbelievably smooth! My fine lines are going away!! You gotta try all of these products. Morning and night, after washing your face, apply the eye cream, then the face and neck cream, then either the AM or PM cream...you'll love the results!

"I think the L'Oreal revitalift eye cream is great! I have been using it for about a week now and I definitely notice a difference. My fine lines are getting smaller and my skin around my eyes is getting tighter. The texture is silky smooth, very moisturizing, but also tightening. It has a small perfume smell but nothing overwhelming. I am very smell sensitive so this is good. I love this product, have already recommended it to friends, and I will be purchasing myself when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the product is wonderful ! It feels cool under my eyes. It is not greasy and my makeup stays on better throughout the day.

"This smells like the same stuff my grandma had. I didn't enjoy that. I would think it could have had a better smell, I wouldnt buy this due to the smell. I was happy to try it because I haven't used any anti wrinkle cream before. It did feel nice and I noticed softer skin. With the set there was somany containers it would have been nice if they where stack able. That would have made the set fit nicer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this product!!! My eyes have never looked so good!!! The cream is light weight and not greasy at all! I have been using the cream for only a week and the difference I see already I s amazing!!

I recently tried the firming eye cream and I must say that I LOVE IT! The dark circles and bags under my eyes have seemed to go away for the most part. I work second shift and have 3 kids I need to get on the bus early morning- so I get about 6 hours of broken up sleep a night... and this helps hide that lack of sleep.

"This eye cream is very moisterizing. My eye area tends to be dry with some fine lines forming (in my 30's).

I saw a significant difference in how my under eye looked within 10 days. It looks smoother and brighter. Plus I really like the formula - it isn't too oily or thick like some other creams I have tried. Highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this eye cream for a week now. It works very well. I apply it after i wash my face...it goes on quite smoothly and seems a bit cool (temp.wise)to me. Also, smells fresh and light. I noticed the dark circles diminished. I will continue using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have this a shot. I don;t typically use eye creams because it strangely makes me breakout around my eyes. So I tired this one sparingly, 2-3times a week. It feels luxurious and we all want that right? I don't feel there are any creams on the market that can fix wrinkles. Maybe temporarily plump, but not for long. So I think this product is best if you want to keep that under ear area supple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
In just three days I can tell a huge difference in the areas around my eye's. My skin is firmer and smoother. The cream goes on smoothly and is non-greasy. Being fragrance free is a huge plus. I was so surprised that it did not irritate my eye's (I have had that problem in the past). I can't wait to see more of the results in the next few weeks.

This anti-wrinkle and firming eye cream is amazing. I used to not leave my apartment without concealer to hide my bags under my eyes; now that is one step I can skip in the mornings. I have only been using this product for week and I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I feel that this eye cream is simply amazing#Loreal Revitalift eye cream. I am 52 years old and have little crows feet around my eyes and also dark and saggy skin. This little miracle in a jar has made under my eyes smooth and firm . It even has evened out the dark circles and almost have eliminated my little crows feet. I have been using it for about 21/2 weeks now and I am loving every minute of it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So far I am in love. I'm not noticing huge changes, but I am noticing some. My eyes don't look as sad and tired anymore. Maybe it's just my mind playing tricks on me, but I honestly feel like my eyes are looking younger! I feel like my eyes are one of my best qualities and the cream is bringing out the best in them. I feel younger and more beautiful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product for over a week, and noticed a difference in that short time. I usually wake up with puffy eyes, but the RevitalLift Anti Wrinkle & Firming Eye Cream made the skin around my eyes tighter. Truly amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In just a short period of time I could absolutely see and feel the difference in my skin. My skin feels better than it ever has and looks it's best! If you're looking for an amazing product that feels lightweight, makes your skin look and feel incredible and shows results.... you have to try this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Being that I tried 4 different L'Oréal revitalift face cream products, I felt the texture of their eye cream in specific felt a little creamier than the rest of the line which feels to me that it's lighter for the most gentlest part of your face, the eyes, I really liked that!. What i want consumers to know is that a dab of this product goes along way so while the bottle is small I feel it will last just as long as the bigger bottles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the eye cream! I see a difference in the wrinkles under my eyes. I have been using it in the morning and the evening. I would definitely recommend this product to people and will continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Not greasy. Does not break out your face. Does not smell bad. However I have seen no results around my eyes. I will keep using it though. Maybe my desired results will take a little longer to achieve. Everyone's face is no the same [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream . I applied this cream to my eyes, after cleansing my face, for 7 days: morning and night. The pros are that it is lightweight and absorbs with fair ease unless you put to much on, as I did initially. A little dab will do, literally. The cons, however, are that after 7 days and nights, I saw no change in the puffiness, firmness, or wrinkling area around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is loving this! Great texture,not too heavy and very noticeable results. I'm wearing less concealer and foundation and I look ""well rested"" even on a few hours of sleep. This will be a skincare staple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the L'Oréal RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming eye cream and I really do love it! I can definitely see a difference under my eyes. My skin feels so good after I apply the cream and it is not greasy or heavy. I can tell that my skin is firmer after using this product. It's really great to find skincare product that works and is gentle on the skin. I will continue using this cream and I will definitely recommend it to my family and friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At first I was quite skeptical, but after a few days, I noticed my dark circles and bags fading. Even my husband, who notices nothing, even saw a difference. A little goes far, but its nice and cooling under my tired eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am loving the anti wrinkle and firming eye cream. I have very sensitive skin and eyes and have not experienced any problems other than perhaps my eyes feeling a bit dry. I like how smooth the cream is and how it feels going on. My eyes feel refreshed almost instantly. Now if I could keep this feeling all day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I havent used this product for 4 weeks but the 2 weeks that I have used it have made me a believer. It definitely firms and smooths the skin under the eyes. It made the fine lines around my eyes less visible. The effects of this product lasts all day. It is creamy without being greasy and absorbs fairly quickly. It made my coverup go on smoother and easier to blend in. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"For the past week I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream. I can say that my skin under my eyes are not dry, but with regards to anything else I really can't see that much of a difference. I have used other firming eye creams before and usually I can feel the skin tightening almost right away, I didn't get this with this product. It just didn't feel like it was working. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The first time I used the L'Oreal RevitaLift eye cream it made my eyes burn and water. The next time I used a little less and while it did not hurt I did not notice any difference with using it nightly. I will not be continuing to use this eye cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Easy to use. Not sure I've seen any real results yet, but only been using a few days. Like the way it feels under my eyes. It is not greasy, but very creamy which makes it pleasant to apply. Reduced dark circles, will continue to use for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
T liked how it firmed up my eyes gave me a youthful look. I recommend this product ladies. I do it at night and in the morning Im cute. It is very skin friendly because I have very sensitive skin and I didnt have a reaction to the product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I've had dark circles under my eyes since I was little, but as I became an adult it got worse. Nothing I tried worked until I tried out this product!! It is amazing how much of a difference I've seen in the past 2 1/2 weeks. My dark circles are almost gone and I feel like a new person. Everyone in my household has seen a difference and are impressed too. If you're looking for something to help firm up and reduce dark circles under your eyes I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product! The eye cream works wonders! I had the typical tired mom eyes. Dark circles and puffiness were so stubborn until i tried L'oreal Revitalift eye cream and they are disappearing before me. Ive tried the entire revitalift line and i feel so moisturized. Aging is inevitable but these products basically give you the chance to freeze time. It is so light and creamy and not oily at all and it smells great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Yet another big score for the Revtalift line of creams. I have noticed some of the under eye puffiness and fine lines around eyes smoothing out in just over a week. No irritation at all for my sensitive skin and the ever so light fragrance is very pleasant. I use with the Firming Night Cream which is the perfect for waking up feeling beautiful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried so many different products like this one and have yet to find one that actually works until now!!! Just in the short time that I have been using the Eye Cream I have noticeable changes. The bags and dark circles are starting to fade in just short weeks!!! The skin around my eyes are tighter as well. This is amazing!!! The fine lines around my eyes have started to fade. This product is all around a GREAT product. I will definitely continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Super product! Long staying and able to put on eye cream/shadow even after the application! Saw results of firming and anti-wrinkle in 3- weeks. I will be purchasing this for myself. I urge you to try it also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am 61 years old. I have numerous fine wrinkles under and around my eyes. I have been using this product for 8 days, and I can truly see the difference. They are lighter, and less noticeable. Love the product. L'Oreal--your great!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this eye cream for at least five years and I really like it. It's very thin in consistency and a little goes a long way. Yet, you still feel it in the morning when you go wash your face. Does it help with wrinkles? I don't know, but I like using it and it's not overly pricey . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product to sample. A little goes a long way. I've only been using this product for about 14 days but I do not see much of a change. The cream goes on smoothly but unlike other creams it doesn't have a cooling sensation with it which I really like in eye creams. I will continue to use this product, it may take a little more time to see a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this eye cream for about a week now. I'm only using it at night since it doesn't have SPF. I definitely thing that would be tremendously helpful and encouraging me to use it more. But for the little time I've been using it, it has definitely moisturized my eye area. I wouldn't say I've noticed any drastic changes or firmness. But it is very soothing and gentle on my very delicate eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Believe it or not, I can already notice a difference. I'm using it morning and night (trying to speed up the process!?). The consistency is nice and goes on easily. The best part if I do feel like my eyes are less puffy in the morning which is great. I also have zero irritation from this eye cream. I've tried may others, including realllllyyyy expensive ones and have had to discontinue using because it either stung when applying or irritated the area after a couple of days applying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using the product as soon as I got it in the mail and it did lighten my dark circles and caused my sunken eyes to appear less so! Even though I became sick a few days after receiving the product I am once again restarting to apply the product to bring my skin back to life. Even though it might not work for everyone depending on the skin elasticity it did work for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been looking for a product to minimize the bags under my eyes and haven't had much luck. I started using the RevitalLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream about a week ago and am starting to see results! The bags are not as pronounced as they used to be and my skin seems a little lighter. The only thing I do not like about this product is the oily feeling - it stays that way all day so I am constantly trying to massage it into my skin to avoid that feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
OMG!...crows feet are starting to lesson....my facial skin and neck are more supple. Im just loving this regimen. All I do is talk about it to my friends and they are seeing the results on my skin. Hope they are jealous!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am a loyal oil of olay eye serum user for years I have used this for only two weeks and I see the difference and so does my husband he said I look younger more recently. I showed my sister all the products and she tried them all and wanted to share with me but I only gave her the names there is no way I am parting with these products this one is a keeper lets just hope its not to expensive in stores..

"I have been using the L'OREAL eye cream for about a week now, and I like the way it makes my face feel. I feel it has tightened around my eyes and I see less wrinkles. I will continue using this product. I am excited to see my results after three more weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't really have a strict face regimen but I went ahead and tried the Revitalift eye cream and it was great. I have a newborn so sleep is interrupted in the night, and I have noticed since I had my baby that I was getting a little darkness under my eyes due to lack of sleep or energy. The cream has reduced it and helped reduce the wrinkles appearance on the sides. Love this product since it works, and is not too oily or heavy and it allows me to go makeup free each day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although the container seems small, it lasts! I love the scent it has. It is very light and easy to use. I don't feel like I'm coating under my eyes with something super thick. When I first started using it I realized I wasn't using as much as I probably could. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My experience using this eye cream was nice. I never use any product for treat this area and when I started to use it I have noticed the eyes with less wrinkles and without eye bags. Finally it is smooth and have good fragance. Thanks, L'OREAL. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Great product for the sensitive eye area. I wear contact lenses and am always cautious about what I use on or near my eyes. I have lots of fine lines and some under eye puffiness especially in the morning. Can't say I've seen dramatic changes but I do see some improvement. Have only been using about two weeks will definitely keep using and give it a chance to show more improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using this product for a couple of weeks, I caught a glimpse of myself in a mirror and suddenly noticed that the lines around my eyes were fainter. I've never used an eye cream, but I will continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the RevitaLift Firming Eye Cream nightly for a week, and am pleased so far with the product. The cream is very rich, applies easily and absorbs completely. There is no obnoxious scent. While it's a bit early to report anti-wrinkle benefits (only reason I didn't give all 5 stars), I like using this cream. Based on the good reputation of L'Oreal products, I expect this will be part of my on-going routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed trying the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream. It goes on so smooth and doesn't have a bad odor to it at all. I feel like it is doing all great job in reducing wrinkles around my eye. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It made my skin feel so much younger. I love this stuff. Try it you will be hooked too....that is if you want beautiful younger skin. Thank you bzzagent for letting me try your products. Keep them coming. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Every morning I woke up I was excited because I felt like the bags under my eyes were less noticeable. I finally took a photo after 1 week of use and could not see any difference. The box says that it takes up to 4 weeks to see results, but after 1 week I don't notice any difference at all. I will be continuing to use it and hope to see a result. It's not greasy or too heavy. It is very comfortable to put on and wear on my skin. The smell is not overwhelming or even noticeable to me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I couldn't give this 5 stars because it when I wore it under makeup (foundation & concealer), it made my under eye crease really bad. So I wore a different eye cream during the day with a cream I know doesn't do that and this eye cream at night. I really loved it because it was moisturizing without over doing it. My eyes felt every smooth and felt firmer. Great product, just not under makeup, at least in my case. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been trying the Eye Cream for 2 weeks now and am noticing that the circles under my eyes are lightened and also not as puffy. The cream is very smooth and cool to the touch and also not very oily at all. The scent is decent, not horrible or overpowering . I will continue to use it in the future as well. The price point is great and affordable, I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a new eye cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is the best eye cream that I have tried in a long time. It was very easy to apply with the directions located on the back of the jar. I started to see a difference after a week and a half after the first application. My skin under my eyes looked great. I would definitely continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My eyes get very dry and painful in the winter so I am down to try any eye cream. Most, honestly, fail. This stuff is a little more thing that what I usually use and soaks in so quickly that the hydrating sensation quickly fades. Ithe did leave my eye area smoother and even got rid of the puffiness I have had lately. I also noticed my wrinkles are practically gone and my eyes look younger. I recommend this, especially for dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I personally did not see any difference but I also do not have much to firm around my eye. I would not knock this product down but still I say give it a try. If you have sensitive or acne prone skin, be very careful. I did get a bump beside my left eye a day or so after trying the product out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't think this product stands up to the other RevitaLift Products. I have been using twice a day since I received and have yet to see any signs of reduction in the dark circles or puffiness under my eyes. Normally I have great results with L'Oreal, unfortunately this is the one product that just doesn't measure up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really loved the way it helped the wrinkles around my eyes, not only that I feel it brightened them as well. This product may be a little more expensive but well worth the money. I will definitely recommending this product to all my friends [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When people look at you you want them to actually notice you, not how tired you may look. I love this eye cream! I noticed a difference from the first night I used it. The next morning under my eyes definitely looked brighter. I use this every morning and every night and have been for a little over a week and the fine lines and wrinkles are also starting to diminish. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the RevitaLift Anti-Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream. It feels good going on and immediately helps the look of wrinkles around my eyes. It doesn't cause any breakouts or redness. It does seem to feel a little bit greasy by the end of the day, but maybe this is part of the process to help keep wrinkles at bay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the RevitaLift eye cream for a week. I love it! I can already see a difference in my fine lines. My foundation and concealer even look better. I love that a little bit goes a long way.

it is costly in the store but i may have to start buying it. i can see a difference and even friends are seeing it even though i wear glasses. i had no idea that the wrinkles were that prominent. i have been squinting die to needing new glasses and i guess the wrinkles kind of set in. i have the new glasses and now this product and there is a difference [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I know that L'Oreal is a trustworthy brand. But almost every eye cream promises an excellent result. But I really like L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream (0.5 oz). It works definitely better than my previous eye cream. I had a dark circles under my eyes. I use this product more than a week 2 times a day. Condition of my skin is improving. I like the texture, the smell and the result. I'm happy to find a product that visibly reduces dark circles! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Perhaps I have not used it enough yet. Perhaps it is the fact that I have a ""flock"" of crows feet that would need more of a cement base to firm up my eye area but if I am being honest (it's what I do!), I haven't seen a huge improvement or reaction yet with this eye cream. I will say it isn't over greasy but so far it isn't as great as the line's other products for me. Once I have used it a full two months, I will update my results.

"Very light weight, couldn't tell I had any on, noticed immediately how soft muy skin was it literally was smooth like a baby's bottom.

I have been using this product morning and evening and can't say enough about it. I didn't realize how tired my eyes looked before using this cream.

"I have tried a lot of eye creams over the years, and I am really impressed by RevitaLift Eye Cream. It is not too thick and yet has enough substance so that you can see a difference in rejuvenating the delicate skin in the eye area. It also gives the skin a dewy feel. The eye area has the most delicate skin and is one of the most important areas for a more youthful look, and RevitaLift Eye Cream does a great job of helping counter the natural wear on the eye area skin.

I have been using the RevitaLift Eye Cream for about 8 days now. All i have is one word AMAZING! This product has made the dark circles under my eyes practically disappear.

I'm so happy that I was picked to try this out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"In the week since I started using this, I have noticed slight changes in my skin. My eyes seem less puffy and smooth underneath. I had no issues with irritation and the cream has a slight fragrance that I enjoy. While subtle so far, I have noticed a slight improvement, so I'm hoping after a few more weeks I will see more of a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Since I have been using this product I have felt the skin around my eyed tightening as well as my dark circles are quite so pronounced. The product absorbs quickly into the skin and I have had no problems applying make up shortly after. I am very pleased with this product and would purchase it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have only been using this eye cream for about two weeks, so it is too soon to tell whether or not it is going to work. I wear contacts, so I make sure to take them out before applying the cream. Thankfully, I have not experienced any burning with my eyes from this cream. I will continue using in the hopes it will reduce the fine lines around my eyes.

"I was hoping for some sign that the eye firming cream worked. I will say I have only used it for a week and they say 4 weeks.... Something about the cream has irritated my eyes, so I will not use it anymore. I do know how to apply lotions by me eyes, so I don't think it's user error. It seemed to put off an odor that was the irritation. I can't say I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I felt a difference immediately. The skin was softer, smoother and looked better. After using several days there was a marked change in the appearance of dark circles and puffiness. Will definately recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Firming Eye Cream did not seem to be much different than the Night Firming Cream. I really could not tell the difference. The cream was light and non-greasy, which is very important. I do not have an issue with puffiness, but the wrinkles are creeping in. Due to nice feel of the cream, I will continue to add this to my routine nightly in hopes of keeping the ""crows feet"" at bay. The scent was pleasant making that worth while.

"Loving this eye cream. After using it for just a few weeks my eyes couldn't look better. Dark circles are going away, no puffiness and even fewer wrinkles. I would recommend to anyone who thinks their eyes could use a little TLC. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product goes on smooth. It isn't greasy like I thought it would be, and I'm certain you could apply makeup over it with no problems. It does burn on my skin a bit, but I have extremely sensitive skin, so I will chalk that one up to me, not the product. I do feel like it moisturized my skin and made it feel smoother in a short period of time. My only complaint, and the reason for only four stars, is the smell. It is just so strong! All in all, this product is worth trying! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The eye cream feels so light and great! Not greasy at all and I swear, I can feel my eye area thanking me. I have never used eye cream before but you can be sure I will continue to use this! My skin is feeling more firm and looks very healthy now. I always had dark circles under my eyes, not from being tired, it's just genetics and they are gone! Love this stuff!!!

"So far I haven't noticed much of a difference in the way my eyes appear. It hasn't been very long since I received this firming eye cream, so I'm not losing faith as of yet! I am not totally crazy about the way it smells. Info like the creamy texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like that this cream is not super thick. It is light weight and goes on easily. It has helped the texture under my eyes. It seems to have improved the fine lines but have only been using for about two weeks. This is a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not really one to use a different eye cream from my moisturizer, but the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream has changed my mind. It is like a cool drink for the skin around my eyes and unlike others I have tried it does not burn if it gets in my eyes. It completely soaks into my skin and does not run into my eyes when I sweat. I really like the way this makes my eyes feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use the eye cream every morning after washing my face. Since using this , my dark circles has decreased, and my crows feet are not as noticeable.

"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream is different than the other brands. It's a lighter cream for the areas around your eyes that tends to wrinkle. I've used it for about a week and love it. Because the area around your eyes is so delicate, this product delivers just the right type of luxurious cream to firm and brighten the skin around your eyes. You'll love the creamy smoothness, richness and! feel of this cream. And it really works [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This eye cream goes on so smooth! It doesn't have the best smell, but that doesn't make a huge difference for me. It's smooth and not greasy or sticky at all.

"I noticed a difference within a few days and began receiving compliments from people I see on a daily basis that I look less tired, which I am far from being, so I wholeheartedly believe it is the result of using this product! It did feel a little greasy when applied but not much worse then other products I have tried and didn't have any of the ""tightness"" that I have experienced with other products like this. Definitely would recommend to other people. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thanks to a buzzagent I've got this eye cream to try fot free. I feels nice, soft and moisturising. It didn't give me any rash or puffiness. On the other hand, I really hate jar packaging: you're trying as hard as you can with spatulas, but you'll end up dipping your fingertips in their anyway. Plus, I don't like way too much parfum. It's not beneficial for skin and actually annoy me. Bottom line: I won't buy it or recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I would consider buying RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle products in the future. Thank You for sending me the products :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this for a week now and it's a good moisturizer that does seem work at making my skin smoother and firmer and reducing my dark circles it's also got a nice smell to it which helps being so close to my nose as I don't like overpowering smells while it is making the dark circles lighter I don't think it's going to be super light also there's only so much firming it can do being it's just a cream but you can use it day or night which is nice [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I do not usually use an eye cream, but after using this, I can feel how hydrated and refreshed my eyes feel. It says that it removes under eye circles and I have not used it enough to notice this yet. But I really like the feeling of it when I put it on and then I put my foundation over top of it around my eyes and it seems to smooth on better with this eye cream than with just a regular moisturizer which is what I have always done. I will continue to buy this cream after this jar is gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Revitalift Anti Wrinkle +Firming Eye Cream for about a week and love it. My eyelids were puffy and saggy but after trying this product they seem much better. The eyelid skin seems firmer and feels smoother than before I started using it. I would recommend this product fully if you have puffy, saggy eyelids.

"It's only been a few days but I do believe it's starting to work. I can feel a difference in the skin under my eyes. It feels tighter and the ""crows feet"" at the corners of my eyes are becoming less visable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's hard to get the same lighting in before and after pictures, but after just one week I can see a difference in the bags under my eyes. As someone who swore by more expensive cream, I can truly say this is changing my mind. This product is silky smooth & has virtually no smell. A little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that there is this product made specifically for targeting the eyes. Since that skin is so thin and easily wrinkled, I'm hoping to see a noticeable difference soon. It seems like a little product goes a long way with this eye cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this eye cream. It is so light and creamy. I use it twice a day and it seems to be working well. I have only been using it for a week so I can't say what it may do for lines and creases around the eyes. But I like it well enought to continue using it. Up till now I have been using Clinique eye cream and I find I like this much better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I only received this product about 3 days ago, so I am hopeful that with a little more time I will see more results. However, in the few days I have used it, I have really liked it. My face seems to be a little better. I have not yet bought the cleanser, but would really like to try that as well. This product did not make my face feel to oily or greast. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first few days that I used this eye cream, I followed the instructions on the box and used it AM and PM. What I found was that my eyeliner would run into it, which gave me a very tired look. It does have a nice silky texture, and works fine as a nighttime moisturizer. So far, I have not noticed any reduction in dark under eye circles, but I have only been using it for about a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for a little over two weeks and will continue to use it for the rest of my life! I have dark circle under my eyes as well as puffy eye lids and this has work very well to help with both of these problems! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this cream and I can't say that I have noticed any difference. May it requires more time than I have used it. I will continue to use this until I run out and then see if I can tell a difference. On the plus side this is easy to use and feels pleasant on my eyelids. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have only been using it for two weeks so I have not seen a huge change but I think with a couple more weeks usage I will. I love the consistency of the cream. The smell is great and again it is so easy to apply and soaks right in. Hopefully in another two weeks I will be telling you of the difference it has made for my eyes. It is from my favorite brand!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am loving this product. It goes on light and smooth, and is non-greasy. I've had NO problem with burning eyes, which many other products caused me. I will continue using to see if it actually erases under eye circles. I have yet to see a difference(1 week). 4 stars because it's ingredient list [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for around two weeks and so far the eye cream is great. It has a smooth creamy texture and leaves the skin around my eyes looking fresh and hydrated. I will continue to use it to hopefully get the best results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although I do enjoy the scent of this product, after continuous use I really haven't seen a vast improvement in the fine lines around my eyes. I have some very serious laugh lines around my eyes and this product has done little to lessen their appearance. I do believe that it may be because I have only been using this product for such a short time and I believe if I continue using it, there could be improvements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream is pleasantly scented and has a nice smooth creamy feel to it. I haven't used it long enough to say it definitely does what it claims to do but I do know that my face feels smoother. And smells good too! This doesn't make my skin feel like I slathered on a bunch of grease. I am going to continue using this and see what happens. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have previously used this eye cream and it is as good today as it was then. Great formula, easy to use. Non greasy. Personally I could see results in about 4 days. Highly recommend this product to anyone with any kind of eye concerns. It works wonders!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great product! It said it would take 4 weeks to see results, but I have been using it a little over a week and the proof is there - hardly any wrinkles around my eyes anymore! Also takes care of the dark circles and puffiness I was experiencing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only had this product about two weeks, but so far, I really like it. I can't say as I have noticed a difference, but I haven't looked at my before picture to compare. I do like that the product goes on very smoothly. I don't have to rub hard, which is nice since it is going on the sensitive area around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Absolutely loving this eye cream! I've been using RevitaLisft Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream for about 2 weeks and am already seeing results. It's smoothing out my skin, lessening the wrinkles, and making it super soft around my eyes. I highly recommend this to anyone who is concerned about wrinkles and the appearance of their eyes aging. Great product and makes me feel good when I put it on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this product. I do however have very sensitive eyes. Even just putting this product on my brow bone and just above my cheek bone caused irritation to my eyes. But that is nothing against the product, I just cant use it. It is very moisturizing though [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this one, i dont think its been quite long enough, its only been 2 weeks but i dont see any signs that prove it to have helped or made things worse. but i am curious to see what happens after the 4th week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this Loreal anti-wrinkle eye cream is a must. I'm 30+ years old and needed a good hydrating cream, this product delivers. I have been using it for over a week and really like the feel of it. It goes on smoothly, feels non greasy, hydrates well and isn't over scented. I haven't seen any wrinkle reduction yet but I haven't used it for an extended period of time. I would recommend this for anyone. I think it is great for sensitive skin like me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried L'Oreal RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream and I love it!!! I didn't have harsh wrinkles by any means, but I was definitely starting to get more visible ones. I have been using it for a week now and can see and feel a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream to reduce puffiness and it worked! I have used it for about one week now and I love it! It is light and smooth to the touch and goes on silky smooth [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product - it goes on smoothly and I put it on first thing in the morning after my shower. it's not greasy and soaks in great! I like how it is able to soften my eye area and while I don't have a ton of wrinkles, it has definitely helped with my raccoon eyes! I even started to get complements about my eye area after the first week, and I noticed it as well! great product, can't wait to see how a few more weeks of use treats my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This eye cream is wonderful. You don't need to use too much, it is very rich and creamy, but it absorbs quickly. The dark circles under my eyes are becoming lighter. The crows feet are looking less noticeable. Even my eyelids seem to be a little less droopy. I have been using morning and night and am very happy with the results. I have sensitive skin and this product has not been irritated at all. Hoping at the 4 week mark I can post some before and after pictures. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is great. I've been using it for about a week now. I can tell the difference that it has been making already. The dark circles under my eyes have already started disappearing. I have been putting it on at night, and my eyes still feel moisturized throughout the next day. This product says it takes four weeks to work so I'm excited to see the results after four weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this everyday for a week now and my skin under my eyes is so soft. I love this because I have really sensitive skin and it does not cause me to break out. I will be getting this again when I run out! I love that it smells good and does not leave a greasy feeling. I would highly suggest this product if you need some life back in your skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product was easy to use. Scent was nice. The eye cream seemed to do some smoothing of my crows feet. I've only used it for approximately 2 wks, but will continue using product for 4wks as recommended by the company for full results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've only been using the product for about a week, so I'm assuming that it takes longer to see results. I'm not really noticing a big difference under my eyes, but I'm going to continue using. I feel like the under eye area needs a little longer to work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This eye cream goes on so smooth, you only need a tiny dab. That's great because it will last a long time! I've noticed the area under my eyes is smoother and softer looking. I don't necessarily feel that they're ""firmed up."" I love the product and will continue to see what benefits it has long term. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this eye cream. I have struggled with the skin around my eyes and have tried many a product. I even considered getting fat transferred. I don't need to do that with this product. I feel like I no longer look tired and older than my years. I literally apply it and forget about it. It's so easy to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have always had trouble with bags under my eyes. No matter how early I go to bed or how much sleep total I get. I still have bags under my eyes. Since I have been using the eye cream it has made the bags less pronounced! I have been using it for only a week!!! I can't wait for a few more weeks to go by. The area under my eyes is not as dark as it used to be. It also looks a little more smooth or firm. Very excited with this eye cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this eye cream. I've used other brands in the past and have noticed little-to-no difference. I have been using the Loreal Eye Cream for 7 days and can already see a reduction in the fine lines and puffiness around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using this product about 2 weeks ago and I can already see the improvement. My under-eyes look less dark and puffy and my whole face just seems to glow from the whole set of RevitaLift Creams. It only takes a few minutes in the a.m. and p.m. and you get great results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the product is amazing! It has a very great smell ! It has started to help with the lines around my eyes! This cream is worth every penny! It didn't leave around my eyes oily or dry it left around my eyes very moist ! I am one satisfied lady this product does it's job . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This eye cream is very moisturizing and did not irritate my eyes. I usually don't use an eye cream because I apply my usual moisturizer around my eyes and it works fine. But I did try this one out and it was pretty good. It didn't make my eyes itch or swell up like most eye creams do. I would not purchase this as I don't think it's a necessary product for me, but I think others out there who need a really moisturizing eye cream would like this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the Loreal Revitalift eyecream is wonderful. I have been using it for over a week and my eyes have less dark circles and my skin is smoother and softer. I look forward to seeing my wrinkles diminish and my skin become firmer as I continue to use it for the best results after 4 weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use just a dab in the morning and again at night before bed. The skin around my eyes appears firmer and fine lines and wrinkles are not as noticeable. I would recommend this eye cream for anyone trying to tighten skin around the eye area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have completed my first week with the eye cream and the day and night creams. While I haven't noticed any difference around my eyes in the wrinkles I can definitely tell that the morning puffiness isn't as bad and my skin feels amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product for a week now. So far so good. It glides on around the eye area and seems to be absorbed into the skin quickly. In the past I have found eye creams that are hard to smooth in, pulling the delicate skin around the eye. The lines around my eyes seem a little softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Eye Cream is amazing. It only takes a little bit for both eyes and within just a few days I could already see and feel a difference. There's no strong scent with the cream either which I felt is a huge plus. The only thing I would change would actually be the instructions on the packaging. Not everyone may know how to use it and most probably wouldn't want to bother having to call and make sure they were using it right if it happened to be the first time they'd used the product.

"As a young woman in her early thirties, Imy extremely concerned and realize the importance of taking time early on to care for thexample most delicate area of your body. The eyes are most delicate and I love the RevitaLift Eye Cream. I noticed a difference in my under eyes. The skin appeared more tighter and youthful. I was amazed at how tight the skin was considering I rarely get sleep. It's easy to apply aND store in my purse for my on the go lifestyle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I been using this every day and at night. My eyelids have become ""crepey"" with age, and I am already seeing an improvement. The skin on and around my eyelids feels more elastic. I can't believe I've found a product that actually delivers on the promises it makes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the L'Oreal RevitaLift eye cream for approximately two weeks, and I love it. Firstly because it does not irritate my eyes or make them water like other eye creams. Secondly, it instantly minimizes the appearance of fine lines around my eyes. It also decreased puffiness in my eyelids. I will continue to use it and enjoy its benefits which is unlike other products I have used in the past. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ive been using this for the past week or so and i love it! I have the baggiest eyes and circles and little wrinkles at the edges (thank you children..) but since ive been using this eye cream i really have noticed that they havent been so baggy and even looks smoother! I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the Eye Cream, it has a light pleasant scent and non-greasy texture. I've only used it about a week, so I haven't noticed any specific benefits as far as wrinkles and/or firming. I do feel like my eye area is more moisturizer though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'oreal revitalift eye cream is a great product . I always wake up with puffy eye in the morning but when I put the revitalized eye. cream on over night I woke up without the puffiness which was great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this for about 2 weeks now with no results noted. I will continue to use it as it may juts take a little longer. But on the up side the skin around my eyes feels firmer and softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the eye cream for about a week now and have not seen any sort of difference. It does have a very fragrant scent which I am not really a fan of. I have been using the eye cream morning and night and and have not seen any sort of firming effect yet. I will be using this product for a few more weeks to see if it needs to be used longer for results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wow, love this Loreal RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle Eye Cream. It is super easy to use, you just need a little and it goes a long way.

"OMG. I've been using this for about 2 weeks and I can honestly say I see a difference. My eye lids have lost their firmness.I used this every day and at night.I already see them getting firmer.

"I've been using the eye cream for about a week. I was hoping it would help with the dark circles under my eyes. I've been applying it twice a day. It's light, goes on smooth, is easy to apply, and doesn't take much. So far I have not noticed a difference in the dark circles or the skin around my eyes, but I will keep using it.

"I've been using the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream for a week now. I use it both in the morning and after I wash my face at night. My under eye does feel extra hydrated. It's only been a week, so I haven't seen any anti-wrinkle benefits yet. This is a great product and it smells really nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is fairly good. I have been searching for an eye cream so i was excited to try it. It feels great going on and doesn't eally have a smell. I like that because several anti-aging products I have tried are overly scented. I haven't noticed any great improvement in my under eye area as of yet so that is the reason for the 3 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This firming eye cream did wonders for my eyes. I have used it for two weeks and the little wrinkles around my eyes has disappeared. I am so happy that i was given the opportunity to try it. It has a lovely fragrance and I am so happy I am not allergic to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream since I received it five days ago. My under eye area looks brighter and firmer with less shadowing. I don't even need to use concealer and my under eye area as well as my crows feet area look noticeably better. The cream is thick and rich and only a little dab will be enough for each application. The cream has a nice light fragrance. I would highly recommend this eye cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that L'OREAL has got the right idea on this eye cream . It's working great been using it for free for the last week .( Thank you L'OREAL and Bzzz for sending these products for free. ) Anyway my skin seems to be softer and I haven't seen any new wrinkles. And my face looks great. Its working for me so far . I'll keep you informed. Thanks again L'OREAL and Bzzz [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the Firming Eye cream for almost a week now. Every night I cleanse my face and put a thin layer under my eyes and rub it in really well. It doesn't leave a greasy feel which I love! I can see a slight difference in the area around my eyes. It looks smoothers, and it also appears that those pesky dark circles under my eyes are getting lighter! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is average. The consistency is creamy and I liked that. Very easy to apply and absorbs nicely. I did not notice any immediate difference in firmness, maybe over a long time. This product does a nice job at adding moisture to the eye area without being greasy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product feels good when applied to my eyes. I haven't used it enough to see if I can tell a difference yet but I like the way it feels. It doesn't feel greasy or it doesn't take much so the container should last a while. I think it is a product that is easy to use even if you aren't used to using anything.

"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream is simply amazing. I often wake with dark, droopy eyes, but using this cream twice a day has made a huge difference! It's nice and thick, but goes on easily. Best of all, it doesn't irritate my super sensitive eyes. I've already seen much improvement in only 10 days. Can't wait to see how much better it gets! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this eye firming cream for about a week now and I can already tell a pretty good difference. I am definitely looking more awake and rested. The bags under my eyes are starting to disappear. I feel like I am having a more youthful look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This eye cream is a lifesaver. It does wonders for my tired and puffy eyes. I wish I had found this earlier. This has really helped the dark circles under my eyes already and I've only been using this about a week. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate my skin one bit! I also love that you can use this under makeup and it doesn't affect or interfere with your makeup regimen either. A total win! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really should be using an eye cream way more often! I'm in my mid thirties and after trying the RevitaLift eye cream I can tell I have not been taking very good care of my skin. This stuff is creamy and light weight and feels in weird way almost cooling under my eyes. I don't really have wrinkles but the under eye cream is still smoothing out the skin. I think it's going to take a little more time to see more results though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love .love .love I have never used any other products for wrinkles expecially for my eyes. I've always had dark circles and puffy eyes. I've been using the eye cream a couple of weeks and I have noticed a big change. No smell to it and doesn't have an oily feel to it. My daughter's have even noticed an difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It firmed up my eyes but it was very slight. You really couldn't tell very much a difference. After using the product it did however make my eyes a little puffy but they were down in the morning and only a short while after I used it in the morning.

"Ive tried lots of different eye creams as im sure many of ya all have. However, L'oreal eye cream made the skin around my eyes feel so soft. My ""crows feet"" are less noticeable also.

"I used the REvitalift Eye Cream for two days and, unfortunately, my sensitive eyes can't tolerate it -- I thought this might be the one eye cream that I could use, but not the case - it leaves me with itchy eyes within an hour of use. Love the other Revitalift products but this is just not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was worrued that this would be too strong for my sensitive eyes but i was mistaken. It did not irritate them whatsoever nor did it make them red at all. I liked the refreshing feeling it left my eyes while i felt tired. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have been using the RevitaLift Anit Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream for over a week and what a wonderful surprise this eye cream is. When I wake up in the morning the puffiness under my eyes has improved tremendously. I also do not have the dark circles as well. I have tried many eye creams in the past and have not received the results like I have with L'Oreals. I will definitely continue to use this product from now on!!

I've only just started using the L'Oreal RevitalLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream but am looking forward to firmer skin in the eye area. While I've always used moisturizer on my face during the day I have to say I've generally neglected the sensitive eye area. I am hopeful that the eye cream will smooth this skin and reduce dark circles in the coming weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using the eye cream for about a week. I have already noticed less puffiness in the morning which has been a problem for me. I have also noticed some of my fine lines starting to disappear.

"I have been trying the eye cream from L'Oreal's revitalift line for about 4 days now and it seems like a great product to help prevent the effects of getting older, but I have very sensitive eyes and something in it makes my eyes very irritated. I do like the overall feel and would recommend it if you do not have sensitivities. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Silky smooth eye cream! You only need a drop and it goes a long way. I haven't noticed a change but my friends have noticed that I don't have such bags under my eyes and I have only been using a week. Great product since people are noticing changes!

"I have always had dark circles under my eyes and have always hated them. I have tried every remedy for dark circles with no success. RevitaLift is starting to make me like my eyes.

"I am so picky when it comes to eye creams. For the longest time I have always gotten Mary Kay brand. I think this one is very similar, maybe even better. The product goes on smooth and isn't greasy or oily feeling. The thickness of the product was perfect. Not too thick or thin. I would highly recommend this product!

"I love L'oreal products, I've never experienced a bad product. I tried the RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream. It just feels like quality when I use it. The cream itself is luxurious without feeling greasy. It moisturizes my fine lines and gives me confidence that they are reduced. Overall, really pleased and I can't wait for the final results!

"I'm really enjoying this product. At 37 years old, this is the first eye cream I've tried and was skeptical of it doing anything. However, it's great at unpuffing your eyes and smoothing fine lines. Very pleased!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE this product. It is so smooth and absorbs quickly and after only 1 week my eyes look refreshed. I work some crazy shifts and I truly don't have that ""tired"" eyes look! This is absolutely the truth and I recommend this product, highly! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After trying numerous items from the Wrinkle + Firming line this is the one product that I would continue to use and re-purchase. It is a nice delicate consistency that absorbs well and feels soft on the skin. I saw some improvement in my under-eye circles and bags in just a few days. I also use it between my eyebrows to help soften up those furrow lines. Its a great moisturizer to add to your routine to give your eyes a little extra TLC. Try it you wont be disappointed!

I'm on day number 5 of adding this to my routine (all revitalift products) and I was so excited to try this for the dark puffiness under my eyes (using the antiwrinkle products to prevent). I have already noticed a slight change! I wish I would have did a before picture so I could show you but this product is working and I haven't even used it a full week. Go buy this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried just about every eye cream on the market. Most disappointed me so I was sceptical to try Revitalift eye cream. The first couple of days I noticed under my eyes were softer and the little lines that had developed seemed less visible. The best part is I finally found an eye cream that does not cause break outs around my eyes. I love this eye cream.....now on day 7 and I will buy this eye cream in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have always had bags under my eyes (joys of being a mom of toddlers) but I have used this product for a little over a week and the bags are going away. My skin is firmer and the dark circles are lightening. I can't wait to see what the next few weeks of using the product entail! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product for 4 days now and I'm quite surprised with the results. It doesn't take much for each use, it's light and no greasy, has a pleasant fragrance. These are all extras though because the results this early have been quite surprising. My skin feels softer already. I don't have a lot of time for a big makeup routine as I work full time and have 2 toddler grandchildren that live with me. But this is quick and easy. I can't wait to see the results in 4 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I waited to review--why! because I don't have really dark circles but I do have stress and lack of sleep .the first place it shows is in my eyes---yikes. since I have been using the eye cream I have seen a difference in the drawn look it has plumped the under eye area up I don't look as tired.the cream goes on well and feels good not greasy just apply and go. I didn't worry that it would mess with my make-up. with many allergies I will have a tired look too. this should do the job. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Just received yesterday; so I have only used 2/x so far, but product is relatively thick; comes packaged nicely although this particular one did not have the seal on the top like the others. It had a pleasant scent also. Based on texture, scent and ingredients I really liked the product. If you prefer a thinner product or scent-free; you may not like this item; however. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all its silky, smooth and absorbs fast. Secondly, it really works!! Also with my sensitive skin (especially in the eye area) a lot of products have a slight burn or irritation around my eyes, even high end brands, and I had no irritation with this product. Love that. Definitely get this #gotitfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think my first week is off with a a bang! I can notice a difference in the baggy eyes. Although it's still early in the process and product states a longer period for results. I did recieve this product as a trial fro. Bzzagent and L'Oréal although this has not effected my opinion [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that it is easy to apply and it doesn't take a lot to do the trick. I haven't been using it long enough to see results so that post will come later. I was really pleased with everything that I received in my box! Can't wait to use everything! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using L'Oreal Paris's eye firming cream as well as the rest of the facial firming regimen and am not impressed. It feels greasy even after rubbing it into my skin but at least it does smell pleasant. So far I am not impressed at all with the line of facial firming creams.

I have been using my Loreal RevitaLiftAntiWrinkle Eye Cream since I received about five days ago. I apply a little cream under my eyes and lids and so far I can see a difference. My dark circles look better and I see some improvement in my fine lines and wrinkles. I love the scent and it is very easy to apply! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been applying the eye cream twice a day- when I wake up and before I go to bed. It goes on smooth and is non-greasy. It does not feel heavy or pore clogging. I already see improvement with the skin around my eyes. My biggest issue with my face is sun damage. I don't really have issues with bags under my eyes, but I feel like the cream is helping reduce the dark circles under my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first thing I noticed was how small the jar was but a little bit goes a really long way. The cream has a clean, mild scent and rubs in very easily without irritating or burning my sensitive under eye skin. I'm on day 3 now and while I haven't seen a major change in the wrinkles and dark circles under my eyes I have noticed my skin is much softer than it was. Overall I'm really liking this product and I'm looking forward to seeing the full difference in 4 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm really enjoying the l'oreal skin care line. I typically have very sensitive skin. The moisturizer is very light. Does not leave your skin feeling heavy. It's day 3 for me and so far I'm loving it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I been using the firming eye cream In the morning and at night for the last 4 days and when I first started using it, I had dark circles under my eyes and my eyes were very puffy. I noticed that the puffiness had gone down and my eyes look more rested, I didn't see any change In the dark circles under my eyes though, but I will keep using it and maybe over time there will. E a change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After my first trial of L'oreal Paris Revitalift eye cream I realized the perfection of its wrapper and container. At first application it was not immediately appreciated, but soon I noticed the natural lift to my upper eye tissue and the below and the circles of my under-eye. These improvements after the first fourty eight hours of use. I noticed a dewy, moist look, to my otherwise sagging eye lids..I believe my success will be excellent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far so good. My second day using L'Oréal RevitaLift Anti Wrinkles. Definitely looking forward to seeing the results. I will post anothe review within the next few weeks to give my update !

I've been using this product for about a week now and already I see less puffiness underneath my eyes. I dont get as much sleep as I should and often wake up with bags under my eyes and this product does a really good job in taking care of the puffiness.

"from the first moment i tried this, super silky without being greasy, eye cream, i knew i was in for a treat. And then days later, the treat is revealed. My under eye area is looking healthier, plumper and less dried and wrinkly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to try this eye cream. I've been searching for the perfect eye cream and this is it. I'm 52 and have fine lines and wrinkles. After using this cream for a couple of weeks I am noticing the lines are fading and my eyes are feeling more moisturized. I have sensitive eyes and this cream does not bother me, which is very important. It's a nice lightweight cream with a slight pleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product for 6 nights in a row, so far. The bags under my eyes have lightened up alot, but that skin does not seem as ""loose"". When I touched it before it felt very soft, almost thin. However it is starting to feel more normal and it looks better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the Anti Wrinkle and Firming Eye Cream during the day and night for the last 3 days. I love how smooth and easy the cream glides on my skin. The smell is also very soothing and invigorating at the same time. My skin in that area does feel more moisturized and look brighter. I also love the jars that the Eye Cream comes in. I keep it on my nightstand so I see it in the morning and at night so I don't forget. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used the L'Oreal eye cream for three days now. I like the smooth texture and the way it feels on the skin . I have used other eye creams, that after applying started to irritate my eyes. So far, I have not seen that with this cream. I look forward to continue using it in the coming weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the eye firming cream for only 3 days. I had become increasingly concerned about the fine lines I noticed around my eyes. I never realized that there was a specific product for this area of the face so I was excited when this product arrived. The product is easy to use and worked well on my sensitive skin. In just a few days I am already beginning to notice positive results. I am excited to see the results after using it for a longer period of time . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is definitely wiry the money! I applied this after washing my face below my eyes morning and night. I can tell a huge difference! I don't think I look so dark under my eyes and my skin around my eyes looks a lot healthier. Get out there and try this stuff guys! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started trying the eye cream last night and then again this morning.. I was running really late this morning and it was very easy to apply. The cream is not sticky and does not have an odor. I am pleasantly surprised so far with this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So this is the first time I try any type of eye cream! I was a little skeptical at first since I wasn't sure what to expect or how it would feel my nose area tend to get a little oily so I was worried about that! I've been using this product for a week now and i LOVE how soft my skin feels and best of all no extra oil!!! I still have 3 weeks in the four week difference but I can already see and feel a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked the L'Oreal Firming Eye Cream. I have a lot of trouble with dark circles and this seems to be helping with that. It is not greasy and does not have much of a smell which is nice in an eye cream. If I had one small complaint it would be that I would prefer a tube to a jar. Other then that it is wonderful! Will be getting again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream was a little too thick, even for an eye cream. it was less creamy and more slippery. It bled into my eyes the first night, which caused some discomfort, but it did make my eyes look brighter and rested to a degree. I probably wouldn't buy this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal anti wrinkle and firming eye cream was so light and refreshing. I stay up late working the night away most evenings and definitely look like the walking dead in the morning. I think this will be an extremely useful cream and I loved how nice my face felt after using it. L'Oreal has done and amazing job with their RevitaLift products. I can't wait to ditch the zombie chic circles under my eyes :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product worked great for me. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream is the second eye cream i have tried. I worry about the dark circle and crows feet which runs strong in my family. I was skeptical on the results i would see if any. To my surprise i did notice a difference in my crows feet! Also i loved how it felt on my skin, another plus was how well it worked with my new routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am very excited to use the RevitaLift Antiwrinkle and Firming Cream. I have dark circles and puffiness under my eyes. I have used this two nights in a row and I already am noticing some changes. My circles are a little lighter and my puffiness is getting better. I can't wait to see what happens in a few more days. This cream goes on smoothly and absorbs very well.

I think the under eye anti-wrinkle cream feels great. I can feel the tightening already after using it. The smell is wonderful and the texture is not greasy and doesn't leave an oily film on your skin. By far this is the best product I have tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is the best by far! Seems that I have lost some puffiness and dark circles already with only a few applications! Thanks Bzz for the sample. I have given out a little to my friends and they love it so far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I think this product is great, it goes on very smooth and does not bother my eyes. The sent is not very strong, and smells great. I can not say if it removes wrinkles, as it does say it can take up to 4 weeks to show results. I will continue to use all products and post results :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just like the rest of the products in this line, this goes on light and has a non-greasy feel. A little definitely goes a long way! I'm excited to see if it makes a difference in my under eye circles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this product! I don't generally take the time for eye cream but I will for this. The packaging made you feel like you were pampering yourself. Nice clean smelling scent. Cream applied easily and was not heavy - a little goes a long way! Would work very well under makeup even though I usually do not wear makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I washed my face and put this on my Eyes and waited for them to dry an it was an instant lift.. I then applied my make up. It was very light an absorbed right into the skin w no oily residue. I would buy this again. I had moderate beginning wrinkles and this made them appear to completely vanish. It also worked over make up just as well dabbing it on.. Try it!

"I really enjoyed using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream. It has helped to reduce the dark circles under my eyes. And its helped to minimize the fine lines that I have at the corner of my eyes. I like that I can use this product under my makeup or even as a stand alone product. Its fragrance free and non-greasy which is a huge plus, in my book! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have received my RevitalLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream and I have to say so far so good. I just received the cream and have started using it. I apply it every night after I take a shower and just pat it on around the eyes. It's very easy to use and smells pretty good as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Today is day one- I used the night time cream, the neck and face firming cream and the eye cream before bed. All were deliciously creamy and made my skin feel like pure silk. I gave it to a 3 because I am just beginning – and I want to see the results week over week. I am currently taking face shots and will have all four at the end of my trial.

I have been struggling with looking so old when I wake up. I have lines under my eyes. I have been using the Anti-Wrinkle and Firming eye cream the last few days. It almost is like magic...how this cream improves the look of my eyes. The cream is light and has a pleasant smell. You need just a little bit and WOW... magic. It certainly has improved the look of my eyes. I really like this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Finally an eye cream that seems to be working!! I have sensitive skin by my eyes and haven't had any problems with this cream. I notice a difference as I am not as puffy as I have been recently. Its only been like 9 days so I am still working on the dark circles but I think this just might be doing the trick! Plus its not greasy and my make up still goes on smoothly and looks great! Wanted to post a picture but it is only letting me add 1 pic. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First night trying the eye cream. I'm not usually the type to buy separate products for different areas of my face but have to admit it did make me feel pampered. I like the feel of the eye cream. Cool to my skin when applied and not greasy at all. 29 days and counting and will continue to review during that time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

First I like the packaging and the size/amount of the product that you receive. I have been using it a week and have already noticed a reduction in the fine lines around my eyes.

"Having a 6 month old baby, I feel and LOOK tired sometimes. This eye cream could not of come at a better time! It has a very light scent and a cooling effect when applied. I only needed several little dots under and around the eye and it applied beautifully with no dragging. It absorbed into the skin quickly and left me looking more awake. I will take pictures after 4 weeks to gain an accurate performance from this cream but so far, So good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Well - I look like I finally got a good night's sleep. This product goes on light and is not irritating at all. I have a hectic life like all of us but even after only one use the lines that appear to be dry and crinkly and made me think of my grandmother, look a little better. Also, as an added bonus my makeup tends to slip or smear during the day after using a night cream and it's almost noon and my makeup is still put. My sister swears by this product and now I know why.

I started seeing my skin's appearance to be brighter and more even toned. The puffiness under my eyes are less and the fine lines are diminishing....LOVE IT!!

I tried the eye cream last night. It was nice and thick and smelt really good. It was also very easy to apply. I am hoping to see results as time goes by as I have noticed a few fine lines in the area. Ingredients are important to me as well as I like to know what I am putting on my face is safe all around. More information as to ingredients on products would be good. However so far so good in terms of quality and presentation [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My items finally came this morning! I have been anticipating their arrival. I have on the eye cream. I put this product around my eyes. I can hardly tell that it's there. This product will be used twice a day so I will do a before and after picture closer to the end of the campaign. I have never been able to use eye creams because my eyes always ended up getting puffy. Here is to hoping L'Oréal Revitalift is different! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Anti Wrinkle + Firming Eye Cream and I love it. It really made the skin around my eyes feel moisturized. The cream was very rich and smooth but it didn't feel heavy on my face and it absorbed really quickly. I tried other creams that were felt greasy and this was very light. I applied it at night and in the morning. I already feel like the skin around my eyes is softer and more supple. I can't wait to see what a few weeks of use will do.

I was super excited to receive my RevitaLift package and immediately applied the eye cream and the face and neck cream. I only have 22 days to test the product so I will see if there is a difference within that period. My eyes are my problem area as they are usually puffy in the mornings and of course I have wrinkles around them that I would love to see fade or disappear! So here we are at day one.....I will start with a lower rating until I know more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have always been skeptical of eye products because they can seem heavy & oily on the skin... so far it feels light & my eyes seem to soak up the cream... it's still to soon to say but so far so good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love everything about this eye cream. Let's start with the container, it is super sleek and look gorgeous on my night stand. Some of these firming creams are notorious for smelling like my grandmas night cream. This is not the case with this product. It smells fresh, goes on smooth with NO OILY residue and makes my skin feel great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

First and foremost let me say that I am an eye cream finatic! I absolutely love trying different brands and I'm very happy when I can find something that gives just the right kind of results for my eyecare concerns.

"I tried this and so far I like this cream. I have sensitive skin, around my eyes, and I don't have a problem with this eye cream. It goes on smooth and doesn't sting. There isn't a strong scent to it. A container has lasted me around 1.5 months when I use it at night.

"as soon as I applied the sample of the Revitalift eye cream, I felt it tingling. It really seems to be working...

"This has a light whipped texture and glides on the skin while providing ALL DAY hydration. I've tried a bizzilion eye creams and I have to say, I really, really like this one.

"Just a few light dabs of this eye cream really help smooth out the skin, hydrate, and make applying concealer a breeze.

"I was recently given the opportunity to try this product out and I am loving it. I have mild dark circles and am starting to develop slight wrinkles around the eye area from squinting. After using this product for a few weeks now, I can honestly say I am starting to see the dark circles diminish and the fine lines and wrinkles fade away. I am obsessed with how light and creamy this eye cream is. AS well as how it instantly absorbs into the skin. I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great eye cream, I noticed a difference in my under eye circles and fine lines almost immediately. After using this regimen (with the day and night creams) for a couple of weeks, my skin was noticeably smoother, brighter and younger looking. It's a great deal for the price!

"This product I Love,Love,Love and have only been using this 4 days, I can see a huge difference already around my eyes. I apply this to my eyelids, above my brow, under my lower lashes and the outer part of my eye (where crows feet would be). Fantastic product."
"I love it! I was tired to try different brands and spent so much many. Before, any product gave me elasticity to my eye area like this cream. Now, I can smile without feeling my skin tight. Other products made me look with more wrinkles. I was looking for an eye cream that moisturize without irritating my eyes. Finally, I found a right product."
"I decided to try this eye cream, and I am so glad I did! Within a couple weeks' use I noticed the dark circles under my eyes and the lines were less noticible. I use it on my lids too and have noticed eye shadow application is much easier and I have fewer problems with creasing."
"After using a particular revitalift product for the past year, I decided to try the eye cream. This product is wonderful. My eyes seem bright, the lines around my eyes seem less noticeable and I hardly have to use any undereye concealer any more. This is a great product at a great price."

Enjoying the texture and quality of the L'Oréal Revitalift eye cream so far... absorbed quickly and not greasy. I typically have pretty sensitive eyes but there was no stinging or itching! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"In two days I've noticed that it has firmed up my skin around my eye areas, they look brighter than normal. I am very impressed with this so far even though im in my mid 20s my eyes look older than my age."
I've been using it for two weeks and it make my skin feel great
I love the way it makes my under eye area feel. It helps my eyes look younger and feel much better.
