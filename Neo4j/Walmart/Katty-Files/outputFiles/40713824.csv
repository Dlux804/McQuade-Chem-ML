"I have been using the night cream and eye cream duo for a month now. I do notice a decrease in my forehead wrinkles and crows feet around my eyes. My skin is also very soft. I am over 50 and realize there is no magic potion to totally erase wrinkles, but this is really helping my overall appearance. I should have started this sooner! Will keep it up and see how it continues to work."
"I am 44. Harsly ever in the sun. I've been using this product a little over 8 weeks. First 4 weeks I noticed my crows feet were thinned out. The lines under my eyes are pretty much gone. They weren't that deep to begin with. My forehead has a lot of deep wrinkles across it. I have noticed they have thinned out about 50%. Box says up to 12 weeks. So, I am giving it another 4 weeks. If i like what i keep seeing I'll keep buying it . I do want to try Neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair too."
"Per a recent episode of Dr. Oz, he noted that the only thing really ""proven"" to reduce wrinkles is retinol. As such, I bought this product and, over time, have seen improvement re my deep wrinkles - I believe this product really performs as it should."
"I used this product for the first time today. After TWO minutes, it completely removed a 'dark/liver spot/sunspot' on my face!!!!!! And it almost completely faded out another one on my forehead. I can't say yet what the long-term effects will be yet. But I'm amazed about the spots disappearing!!! I did just exfoliate my face beforehand. I tried it on another spot on my arm and it lightened up about halfway. I wish I had a before and after photo! Thank you Roc and Walmart for the great prices as well. Lisa Age 54"
I love this stuff in just a week I can see a difference in my face and the bags/ dark spots under my eyes is just about gone. Will be buying more in the future.
"Feels nice on the skin, not oily, seems to be helping improve the look of large pours in my skin, I will buy again"
"I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I noticed a difference right away. It does sting a bit at first but not painful at all. Very pleased with ROC, I will use this again & again"
I purchased this and the retinol is soft and creamy. The undereye cream was thinner but still nice. I returned the product because I'm already using a dat treatment and I think the chemicals conflicted. My skin looked irritated.
