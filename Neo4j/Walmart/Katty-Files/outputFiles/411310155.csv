I think this is doing wonders for my face! Doesn't irritate and makes my skin smoother and I believe the lines are diminished some. I use it every night before bedtime -- not greasy at all.
"From the very start, I LOVE how soft and satiny this makes my skin feel. I have been using it for a while, and I can see improvements in the fine lines and wrinkles. I also use the Natural Collagen and Placenta Creme in the morning ... TOGETHER this is a dyno-mite duo!! Oh... and the smell?? Light and clean!!!"
"Use this product daily, wouldn't be it. good product."
"I bought this before 5yr , and very happy with the results."
Great cream. Makes your skin feel n look amazing. And what an amazing value!
"I've only been using this product for a couple of days, but already I see that the puffiness under my eyes is greatly reduced."
"I ordered this and started using it just this week. Right now, I am doing it only 4 nights a week, because I have read before not to use it too frequently at first. I have noticed a HUGE difference after just 3 treatments! I sleep on my side, and have deep ""groves"" on the side of my face that I sleep on. Well, as of today, they are hardly noticeable! I will continue using this and highly recommend it. I am turning 61 in a few weeks and already did not look my age and now, I am looking even younger! Thank you for selling this!"
"I really like this product. I am on my third container of it. I bought for my daughters as well once I tried it. My oldest daughter really likes it, my other daughter has not tried it yet. I really like products with retinol in them. Also, I don't find this cream to be oily or greasy as I do have combination skin. I like that it isn't expensive either. I highly recommend (I am approaching 70 years of age)."
I really like this cream. I do not know when they started to add fragrance to it. Due to people having so much trouble with unneeded additives why do they need to add fragrance. Please take this unneeded addition from this cream unless the fragrance is natural.
"I was hesitant to use Retinol Cream because I have sensitive skin, I was a little red at first and thought, another one headed for the garbage, not so! I use it three times a week and am happy with the way my skin has responded and the redness is slight and goes away."
"I recently had a compliment from a friend, she backed up hesitated and said, ""How old are you, your skin looks amazing?!"""
"I bought this because I took a WebMD quiz about aging. It suggested using a vitamin a cream every morning and night on your hands. After using this product for just over a week, I have noticed a significant fading in my burn scar on the top of my left hand. On top of that, my cuticles no longer peel and my skin on my hands feels and appears thicker. I only use a small amount (about a nickel for both hands) every morning and evening. I look forward to 6 months from now!"
I have been using this product for about a month now and the appearance of my skin is much better. I am also using a Hyaluronic Acid product before I put this on. With the two (both from Puritan's Pride). I should have started using this before now but at 52 it's better late than never. Both products make my skin feel great as well.
"I am 43 years old, I do not drink but do occasionly do smoke and have 4 boys. I have been serving cocktails, and Everyday someone is shocked by how young I look. I tell them about the retinol cream and how wonderful it us. I have been using this particular brand from PP, and swear by it. It really works....."
"This product, along with collagen, helps keep your face wrinkle free. I use this daily before putting on makeup or whenever I'm not using makeup. It is a daily routine for me. I am 76 years old and my face is wrinkle free, which is noticed by many people who see me. You will never regret using this combination. Just start early. I've been using collagen since I was 37 years old and added the Retinol about 15 years ago."
"I NEVER write reviews for products but this time I can't resist. Retinol cream is very expensive in almost every brand. But this version is a true bargain and it is so effective, I am impressed. Retinol promotes more rapid turnover of skin cells so new cells are at the surface. My skin is so much better textured and the pink blotchy areas are gone since using this for a few months. Even the sun damage spots have faded a lot. I'm in my early 60's and I wish I had started using this years ago."
"I purchased this product and really like it. People have been saying it is greasy, but you can't slather it on. I put very little on my finger tip and apply until it is completely absorbed. If I used it every night like I probably should, I'm sure it would lighten dark spots. It smells nice too. I will definitely buy again."
"I've been using this cream for a while now and while it hasn't gotten rid of my wrinkles it has softened the look of them. The small jar lasts longer than you might think as a little goes a long way. I use it at night after washing my face. It has a scent that is somewhat like citrus, not bad. I will definitely continue to use this product."
This product is very pleasant to use. It absorbs very well and feels very good. I am very wrinkled so it will take some time before I can see if it softens the lines to any degree. In the meantime I feel it will be a very good cream. At least as good as many much more expensive products
"I just turned 52, I only have 2 wrinkles thus far, so I'm trying several different face creams to keep time from giving me more wrinkles. This product is amazing, and I seen results after 3 weeks of using. It's a wonderful cream to layer with other face creams that I use. It's a little potent for my face, so I have to layer it with another product. I really like it so far, and more than likely will continue to use in the future. My face says ""yes"" to this Retinol Cream. Great price also which also makes it a keeper for me."
"Only used for a week, but had issues with the fragrance in it, namely headache and inflammation of the eyes. The cream would have been more effective if it was fragrance-free. The ingredient listing had a high concentration of retinol, which I was looking for. Hopefully PP will bring more skin care products without fragrance to those of us with sensitivities and allergies."
"mineral oil is the cheapest of ingredients, the sort of thing you see at the dollar store"
so I'm surprised to see it here - the cream is not expensive and I use it on chest tummy arms body as I do not want mineral oil on my face! I also mix it with natural creams- it's not horrible but certainly mediocre quality ingredients
"I've been using this retinol cream for over 10 years. I just had my 65th birthday less than two weeks ago. I love this stuff!! I've never been one to be involved in a beauty regimen, but just dabbing a small portion and gently rubbing it into my skin after I've washed my face works wonders. My skin is so soft, and my wrinkles are truly less defined. When asked my age, I have no problem telling it!! I've recently started applying the cream to my ""crepe paper"" thighs--you wouldn't believe the difference!! I love this stuff!!!"
"Dr. Oz recommends retinol cream in the PM and ceramide cream in the daytime for aging skin. I shopped around, and retinol cream was outrageously expensive. I was skeptical when I found it here for such a low price. I have been using it faithfully now for 4 months, and I won't consider using anything else. There is no greasy residue, and the scent is light and pleasant. The lines on my previously dry, tight skin have softened, and my face has a dewy appearance. I highly recommend this cream because it works."
"I have been using this along with the collagen cream for a little more than two weeks, and right away I saw a difference. My face seems to be looking younger ever day! My lines, even the deep ones are smoothing out. This cream works as well as any expensive creams that I have used and really better I think. The price is so reasonable. I do recommend that it be used with the collagen cream."
"Puritans Pride refunded me for my purchase very graciously. Thank you. This product smells like synthetic fragrance so strong, it was impossible to even try. This seems counter intuitive to achieving a healthier body. Please formulate a similar all natural product."
"I gave it a try, bought 2 +3 free 2 oz size for $20. wow I realy like this Retinol cream, i am 63, after using the cream for 1 month I can see my skin needed it ! Next time i will buy 4 oz size and will use it all over my body, not just my face/neck/ chest. Cream is non greasy, not scented, absorbes really fast, I give it 5 stars for sure!!! .The price is great too. Jeri"
"I always read ingredients from what I put inside as well as outside my body. I also do not believe well known brands or expensive products are better, I use what works for me, and I live in Los Angeles ! This cream is an excellent moisturizer and non-greasy. I hope Puritan Pride continues to make these and many more top quality products."
"The Retinol cream has been a favorite cosmetic of mine for years. I have spent untold money on expensive cell regenerators and serums, just to find I always go back to the Retinol cream because it actually makes a noticeable difference in my skin. Nothing can totally undo the effects of aging, but the Retinol plumps the skin almost immediately, giving it a more youthful texture and smoother look. An ""A"" product."
"I have used retinol cream by Puritan's Pride for many years and I am very pleased with the results. My skin is smoother, softer and looks better. I particular like using it at night before bed time in the hard cold winter months in Chicago. It has done nothing but worked for me. My daughter has started to use it too and her face is clearing up and looks much brighter and more healthy. Thank you for a good product."
"I have been using Puritan Pride Retinol Cream for the last few years and it makes your skin so soft and silky. I also use it as a hand cream and it makes your hands so soft. The best part is the price, especially when they have their sales and free shipping! You can't find a better bargain or such a wonderful product!"
"I read the reviews before I ordered my first jar of retinol cream. Several commented on the fragrance and how badly it smells. Well, I was pleasantly surprised to smell at least a perfumy fragrance! I was not looking forward to what several described as a not-so-good odor. Now, this is my first day to use it, but thus far the aroma is a bit strong but not unpleasant at all! Glad I ordered it! Cannot wait to see how it helps my skin! I will write another review when I see the results."
"I have been using this retinol cream for about three months on my neck and face at night and it makes my skin feel like velvet. (Apply with upward strokes.) I have extremely sensitive, dry skin and this cream is so gentle I can even use it around my eyes. I am 58 and people have recently commented on how good my skin looks!"
"I bought some of this to try and I absolutely love it. At night, before bed, I will wash my face and then put some of the retinol cream on. When I wake up my skin is brighter, moisturized, and feels soft and smooth. I only use this at night though because I found if I use it during the day my face will get more greasy then normal, BUT if used at night, it soaks in nice, and does not leave my face greasy when I wake up. Will definitely order more once mine runs out (a little goes along way!!)."
"I used this and the Coenzyme q-10 serum - and the combination is working really well. I used them at night, (serum first and then wait 10 min) and then use the cream. During the day, I use the serum and then 50 spf moisturizing sun screen and the results I am getting are so much better than any high cost creams and night creams from fancy stores or even department stores. It really works... My skin has crows feet and fine lines and wrinkles and was dull... this is just what it needed. GREAT stuff"
"Was introduced to this product during stint at Vitamin World. I never much cared for skin care products or wrinkles removers but my face was always dry, especially after shaving, drove me nuts. Always had dry skin and flakes like rosesea around my nose and forehead, not bad but annoying. I'm 37 and have been using this product for 10+ years daily, plus witchhazel as astingent, and I actually was told at the office how young I looked, seriously???"
I have used this cream for several years and love the results. I am almost 50 years old and when people find out my age they always say you sure dont look your age you look like you are in your late 30'S. They ask what is your secret i tell them I use this retinol cream then they ask where can I get some of this stuff ! I love this cream.
"With so many creams on the market, it's hard to know what to choose. The one proven ingredient that dermatologists recommend over an over for combating fine lines and wrinkles is Retinol. Why spend 4 times as much for ""designer"" products that are filled with other ingredients when you can get this at a fraction of the cost? I love this cream and saw a huge improvement in my skin the first week. I would highly recommend it."
I bought this 4 months ago and notice a difference in my skin. I read the other reviews and see where someone asked that it have SPF. This cream and all retinol creams should be used at night so it doesn't need SPF. It was also called oily but it isn't if you use a small amount. You don't need much.
"I really love this product. I've bought it repeatedly over the last five years or more. I apply it at night after I've washed my face, and it just feels so good. It soaks into my skin quite well. It has a very neutral scent to it, nothing overwhelming. I've never used it during the day under my make-up; I don't think I would like it for that purpose. I use Vitamin C Serum instead for daytime wear. My skin feels so good. I highly recommend this product."
"I've heard for years the best cream you can use for your complexion is retinol cream, so I started looking for it. I found this several years at Puritan and ordered it, have gotten it for others because it is such a good feeling cream and also such a good price on it. I would highly recommend it. I am a young eighty years old and do feel this helps to keep me there!!!!"
"I love this product, I use it every night and have for years. I actually mix liquid vitamin E, CoQ10 with it and that is my night cream. It's awesome, I get complemented all the time on my skin and how I look younger than I am. I would recommend it to everyone of all ages."
"I started using retinol cream all day, but now I use the collegan plcenta night cream too. They are bolth very goog products. Puritan's Pride has great products. Much better than those expensive one's that are in the big stores. My face and neak feels great, it is soft and makes me look younger than I am. When you get a little older your neck shows your age, but these 2 creams makes your neck look smooth and works great!"
"I have used this product for the past several years. When I ran out, there was no substitute for me. Other products looked oily or dried up quickly. This cream stayed on my skin, especially my face and made it look healthy. I like this product very much and recommend it."
"I've started using this product rather recently. I like it. I'm not sure it's made a significant difference in my appearance but my skin feels a bit softer, the product doesn't leave a greasy residue. I've used other, similar products & prefer this 1."
"I have been using this product for only a couple of weeks and can already see improvements. The wrinkles are smoother, and my face looks more even tone, and there is a slight glow to my face. I will continue to use this product to see if my complexion continues to improve. Thank you so much for the opportunity to buy this product at a reasonable price."
"I didn't tell anyone about starting to use this product, but after a couple of weeks I could tell the diffence and others could too. One of the best things about this product is it is so affordable. There are lots of high priced items out there to help with your facial skin, but this really works."
"I first heard on Dr. Oz about Retinol cream to fight wrinkles so I knew it was a safe product and a good one to try. I like it because it doesn't have alot of additives in it like the higher priced commercial creams. I use it twice a day and have noticed smaller pores, less dryness and an all around more youthful appearance to my face. I am 41 but look to be in my early 30's."
"I have used the Retinol Cream for many many years and simply love it the only cream I use now, The Lysine Ointment outstanding I used to have to hunt it down and now after finding it at Purtians Pride I simply place and order and have it very soon. The Retinol Body Soap is all I use now to wash with they removed it a short while back and I paniced so glad they chose to return it to their line up. I give a 5 star of Excellence to all 3 items. Can't say enough good about them all."
"Two days after I began to use this cream, my face started peeling and I began to get red bumps on my normally clear skin. I was encouraged by the reviews before I bought the cream, but I'm sorry I won't be able to continue to use it. I will keep it and use it on my hands and chest that aren't as sensitive as my face. I really wish I could get the results others have been getting...I'm jealous! :)"
"i got retinol cream about a week ago i cant beleive how soft my face is ive tried store brands and nothing, this is a awesome product . highly recommand i felt the difference the first use so if your face is dry get this product and theres no sent on your face."
"Been using this Retinol Cream for years @ least 20 yrs. or more. I have no wrinkles on my face and I'm almost 60. But I do have wrinkles on my neck which, I had read that retinol does not work on your neck? I don't know why it would not, if it works on your face? Been using this cream before it came out retinol helps stop wrinkles on your face, long before it came out in the stores with those brand name brands that cost a lot more $$$.I'm still trying to find something to stop wrinkles on my neck!"
"I'm almost finished with the jar of Retinol Cream. It seems to apply nicely and stayed creamy in the jar (some products get firmer/harder) so that's a plus. However, it does nothing special at all for the skin. I will not purchase this product again. It may work on younger faces, but I'm in my sixties and although I have rather smooth skin with minor wrinkles and some sagging, I was hoping it would do more."
"I have used many different face moisturizers and, for a time, have enjoyed good results. Without a doubt after several months skin irritation begin to appear. No so with Retinol Cream! I have been using this product for 2 years and my skin has never been in better shape. All my friends and relatives are using the product because of the condition of my skin. What few wrinkles I was starting to get has smoothed out. Couple the condition of my skin and the price - - - this product is unbeatable."
"i will never have to look for any other kind of retinol cream anywhere else!.........my search is over.......i can actually SEE the firmness of my skin in less than 2 weeks. i feel blessed. please keep the quality and prices in such a way puritans pride that all can experience what i am. thank you so much..............sincerely, janice"
"I purchased this product because i heard so much about retinol and the great reviews....well, the reviews are right! I love this product. My skin is soft and moisturized. I use it at night before bed. I use the collegen day cream before i apply my make-up. It stays on all day. Both are great products that i will continue to purchase."
"I've been using this cream for a few years now morning & night - with no complaints. Retinol is something great for the skin: face, neck and hands which is where I apply it and skin is soft and subtle. Love it ! The expense is minimal for the benefits derived! thanks Puritan!"
"I have used this product for several years and my daughter says she can really tell a difference in my complexion since I have been using it. My face feels and looks smoother and more hydrated. I never miss a day of using it in the morning and again at night. I not only use it on my face but also on my hands, arms and legs to get that hydrated and smooth feeling all over."
"This retinol cream is the best I've ever used, and I confess, I have tried everything out there! I promise you will love the way your skin looks... It is gentle and effective, delivering all of the nutrients your skin needs without any redness or irritation."
I am 51 and my face and neck have fine lines and wrinkles. I have been using Puritan's Pride Retinol for over a year and my lines have diminished considerably. This is the best product that I have ever used to diminish wrinkles and the cost is so much less expensive than top name brands!
"I love the cream, the way it makes my skin feel, but the fragrance they use is not good. There is nothing ""pretty"" about it! I really do not like the smell of it, but I do, however like the ""feel"" so I will continue to use it. I just wish they would leave the fragrance OUT of it!"
"I've ordered this cream some time ago & started using it as an all over body cream. I so love this cream that I have one at home and one I carry in my bag. A little goes a long way and the results are magnificent!!! You won't go wrong with this purchase. I want to also try some of your other creams to alternate for ultimate results. Puritan Pride, you've got a winner here... Thank You soooooooooo much!!!"
"I've used this cream for a few years now, and it work very well for me. I used it under my eyes every day, and have not wrinkles at all. It is very smooth, light, effective, I recommend it highly to all women who need a little help with early wrinkles under the eye."
"Been religiously using your retinol cream for years now. I've experimented with other otc creams, but I always come back to this one. Can wear it alone or under makeup. Is light and refreshing. Gives my skin a nice glow. Not to mention the price cannot be beat. Thank you Puritan's Pride for another great product!!"
"THIS RETINOL CREAM IS WONDERFUL. AFTER USING ANOTHER PRODUCT FOR MONTHS AND HAVING NO LUCK WITH IT AT ALL,I STARTED USING RETINOL CREAM, WITH IN 2 WEEKS I SAW A HUGE CHANGE. MY SKIN IS SOFTER AND THE WRINKLES ARE LESS DEFINED,IT IS WONDERFUL. I HOPE I NEVER WILL BE WITH OUT IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH."
"I was so excited to read all the great reviews that I had to try this. How could something so affordable be so fantastic? But, alas, this product did not live up to the reviews in my case. Maybe it's because I'm 62 and live in the desert and have spent my life in the sun and heat, but I was hoping it would do more. It does go on easily, absorbs immediately, is very affordable, and the smell is ok...just doesn't hydrate like I hoped it would."
"The cream is light, goes on easy, soaks in with no greasy feeling. I can notice a difference in my skin and will continue using this product. However, please take the ""fragrance"" out. The cream has a very ""grand ma"" smelling fragrance that is strong and lingers long after application. Maybe some people like the smell. I am a 46 year old man (yes, I like younger looking skin too) and I don't want to smell like my sweet little old grand ma. I hate the smell."
First time using this product and it is great. The price is great. I am over 50 years old and my skin looks an feels better This cream any where else would cost money I could not afford. Puritan Pride makes all their proucts affordable and the quality is the best. Thank you Puritan Pride.
"I have been using this for many years and it still works as good as ever. My skin is soft and young looking. In fact, I'm often mistaken for my granddaughter's mother! I think one of the reasons that it works so well for me is because I started using it at a young age and it helped slow the development of wrinkles. I strongly recommend this cream."
"The whole process was a breeze, quick and painless. I received my product right away, without any delays. I have been using it for over two weeks now and have noticed a difference in the fine lines near my eyes and mouth. I love this product. K.S. Belchertown, MA"
I am amazed at the way this cream softens my hands. No other product has maintained this feel and it even has a pleasing scent. The container I have is listed as Perfectly Pure under the same item #. Hopefully when I reorder it will still be the same product under a different name.
"I have been purchasing this product and I am very happy with it. My skin is soft, smooth and much younger. It is unbelievable. Last week, I met my friends whom I haven't seen for 10 years and they were suprised why I have looked younger than before. I refer it to my friends, and they absolutely will order some."
"This is the best skin cream I have ever used. I've been using it for 6 months and definitely see positive results in the texture, feeling and appearance of my skin. I use it nightly on my face and neck and it absorbs quickly yet leaves my skin feeling soft, moisturized and healthy. I love this product!"
"I believe this cream has helped me get rid of or reduce minor lines, but my favorite feature is that is disappears within short minutes so I can apply makeup easily, unlike some creams. It moisturizes without being greasy ."
"I have been using this retinol cream for several years, and use it as a night cream. I am well into my 80's and friends comment on my lack of wrinkles."
I have been using this on and off for years. I have tried other very expensive products but nothing has worked as well as this. I use tretinoin 3 times per week and this cream Nightly.
I absolutely LOVE this cream and I use it every single day and night!! I have seen tremendous improvement in my skin (I am 47 yrs old).... I will continue to use this cream for many years to come!!!
Excellent product but retinal creams should be packaged in a tube or opaque bottle to slow down oxidation cause by light. Will have to consider before re- ordering.
I am 50yrs and have been using this cream from about seven years. I love it. I actually received better results from this cream than an expensive Lancôme cream I purchased.
I am 81 and have been using your Retinol Cream nightly for over 5 years ~ I am delighted that my skin continues to look as flawless as it does ~ I can now get by without foundation ~ everyone thinks I look much younger than my age ~
"I have been using this for several months. I have been told my skin looks younger now. It's definitely more smooth and my fine lines are less visible. I apply it morning & evening, a little goes a long way."
"The best Retinol Creme on the market and I've been using it for over a year. I wouldn't trade it for the world!!! Best value for a retinol creme there is!! Don't give our secret away ladies or Puritan Pride will raise the price,lol!!!!"
I have been using this product for over ten years and I am tremendously pleased with the results. I am 61 years old and people think that I am in my 50's. It is non greasy and I use it in the mornings and evenings. I use it as a make-up base.
I have used this product for years - it's amazing! I have gifted this to friends and family - they too are very pleased with the product. I highly recommend to use this product to help prevent wrinkles.
I have been using this cream for over 30 years! As a result I have very young-looking skin...Most people do not believe me when I tell them my age...I truly believe it is because I have used the Retinol cream faithfully every day.
"I have been using Puritan Pride's Retinol Cream for 20 years. It has kept the skin on my face hydrated, smooth, soft and has minimized wrinkles. People can't believe that I am 80 years old! I highly recommend it especially for people with dry skin."
"Before I purchased the cream, I read all the reviews. Most of the people said that they saw the effect of the cream after 2 weeks. It is more than 2 weeks, and my face still looks the same as before."
"I have noticed a more clear complexion since I have used this product. It isn't comparable to something much more expensive from a dermatologist, but for an over the counter product, I am very pleased with the results."
I rarely write reviews for products unless they are extremely wonderful. This is one of them. I have seen wonderful results with this cream and it is such a great price. Will be buying again!
There were about 16 ingredients listed before retinol. Mineral oil being one of them. Strange smell and felt greasy. Would not recommend and am not going to use. Shipping was timely.
I HATE THE STINK - WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING? NO ONE WANTS IMMITATION FAKE PARFUME IN THEIR FACE CREAM ESPECIALLY. CAN'T USE IT. THE ODOR KEEPS ME FROM GIVING IT A HONEST TEST.
"I have been using this for over 20 years and I am very, very pleased with it. Last year I tried another product and could see the lines on my face returning. I am 65 years old and folks thing that I am in my 50's."
"I was disappointed in it. I have been buying it for years and loved the feeling and texture of it. You obviously have changed the formula. It goes on smooth but only for a moment, then it seems to dry out very fast....nothing like before."
"I will be relegated to using the cream maybe on my forehead and temples, and then extremities, but not my face, as I had hoped. The perfume is overpowering. Where I have used it, it makes my skin feel good. Its just a shame, all the perfume. RH, Va."
"This is a very good product that compares favorably to other products that brand themselves as moisturizers. It goes on well without that greasy feel, and it blends right in."
"This is not a bad moisturizer, soaks in quickly and doesn't leave a greasy feel. But, the smell is horrendous! It smells like my grandmother's old Pond's night cream! I really like the feel of this, but can't stand the smell!"
"I have been using vitamin A facial cream for years and have tried other brands. Puritan Pride retinol cream contains more units (100,000 IU /ounce) than the others I have tried at a more than competitive price. I try not to run out."
This cream is unbelievable how it has made my 62 yr old neck smooth!!! Try it and see what I mean!! I will never ever be without this. Would take a bath in it if I could!!!
I love this cream. O noticed significant reduction and some wrinkles I had in my face. Nice texture . The smell could be a little more pleasant... But overall very satisfied.
I just love the Retnol Cream .. I even put it on the back of my hands..they are soft and looks really great.. but this is the only cream that I ever want for my face.. I give this cream 5 stars
Unless they have changed this in the past year or so...I had to get refunded. This product has a VERY bad smell I could not tolerate it...cant say how well it works....opening the jar for me was enough.
Have been using this product for 10 years +. Wouldn't even think of trying anything else. I am 64 year old and have been told my facial complexion is perfect which I know is due to the product. I use it at least 2 times a day.
I bought this retinol face cream to get the most benefit out of the retinol. I think it works fine and smells good. It is heavy so i wear it at night. I haven't finished the jar yet so i dont see alot of difference but my face feels soft.
"I live in CO in a very dry climate, high altitude which is hard on my skin. This cream leaves my face feeling very moist and dewy.It smells nice, and It is a fantastic value too. Very happy! :)"
My face just drinks in as I apply this cream. I see a huge difference already after applying it at night. My face feels much softer and the price is great too!
Love this rentinol cream. I don't look my age. The only thing that would make it PERFECT is if it contained an SPF -- then I could wear it alone during the day.
"This is my first time using this Retinol Cream, and I will continue to buy it. My face feels so soft and smooth. It does not make my eyes sting like some other face creams that I have tried. I highly recommend this product."
"My Mom turned me on to this cream and I have used it for years now. She is turning 90 and her face is wrinkle free. It sinks into your skin, no greasy feeling and leaves you feeling and looking hydrated all day. I recommend this product highly."
"I have used this product for years and my skin tells the story. It out-performs all other products on the market, and I've tried a lot of them. Do your skin a favor with this cream."
I've been using the Retinol cream for years and love it. It is not greasy and can be used under foundation during the day or as a night cream. Also great for the neck.
"been using this for about 6 months now. this cream is nice and thick, but absorbs quickly. i have been using it both day and night. it's also fragrance free"
I had read about the benefits of using retinol cream with aging skin. I began using this the day I received it after washing my face before bed. I cannot believe how smooth and soft my skin is. I am a very happy customer.
Love it. My sister gave me a jar about two years ago and have been supplying me with it until now. Decided to buy it for me and her this time. Use it every day.
"I have used alot of high-priced skin care in my years. I tried this on a whim and was so pleasantly surprised! No hype just good stuff! My only regret is that it doesn't seem to have any sun-screen in it, as I'm outside ALL summer!"
My wife and I have been using the Retinol Cream for over 10 years. We've also given it to family members and friends who asked us why our complexions always look so good They're also hooked on it. .Great product for a great price with great results.
"I've been using Puritan's Pride skin care products for over a decade. There are better than the expensive department products and much, much cheaper. I use this Retinol Cream and just love it."
Search and compared similiar products and found product to be the best and the price. I can visiblibly see the results and would hightly recommend this product.
"I use this cream nightly after washing my face thoroughly. It helps smooth wrinkles and gives my face a youthful, smooth look. The results are as good, if not better, than expensive creams on the market. The value is great!"
Have been using this item over ten years. This is the only item I will use on my face day and at night before bed. I am 56 and look a few years younger. Great on skin. Sware by this item. Highly recommend!!!
"I use this product as a face cream base for my own blend of aromatherapy oils which I add to it. My skin feels moisturised and soft every day... Thank you, Puritan's Pride!"
"I've use all kinds of face creams and will be 70 before the year ends, this is the first that has major results, thanks Puritan for carrying this product. I love the results! I have only used it 2 weeks but will be a faithful user now."
If you are looking for a miracle product there is no such thing but if you want a great moisturizer that lasts and makes your skin look good at a really good price then look no farther.................................
i truly feel that the Retinol cream does as good a job of hydrating and smoothing my skin as any other product at quadruple the price! i dont usually write reviews but your product is excellent!
"I love, love, love this product! I have used it for several years, the only cream I use on my face in the summer and winter. Not greasy, absorbs into my skin quickly."
Have been using this product through your Company for well over 10 years and what can I say the results are noticeable. Besides Retinol Cream am using various Vitamin and Mineral Products as well to maintain my health status.
I have been using Retinol Cream for about six yrs. Love every oz. of it.Skin is always soft and smooth. I use it as a body cream and have very few flaw's in my face or on my body. Very Satisfied.
I fix this cream with vit C cream which I bought on Puritan. In the morning I could tell my skin more radiant & even toned. Would definitely recommend this vit A cream.
"i have been looking for a perfect cream suitable for my sensitive skin and at last i found pp retinol cream, makes my skin smooth, it doesnt irritate even my sensitive skin...i will continue to use this product !!!"
"I've been using this Retinol cream for a few years now, and love the thick, whipped-like, fluffy consistency of it. A little goes a long way, so it's also a great value!"
"Retinol cream has a pleasant scent, absorbs easily and has had a positive effect on my skin. I see improved clarity and brightness. This product is fairly priced and one I plan to use regularly."
Using for approximately 3 weeks and really like the results. My skin is so soft and is starting to look so much healthier. I am very impressed the the amount of vitamin A also. Will keep my shelf stocked.
"I have sensitive skin, so I only use it at night. It absorbs quickly and makes my skin feel hydrated and fresh. I have noticed a nice glow to my face, too!"
I have been using this cream for a few years. It works wonderfully. It keeps my skin soft and smooth. People seldom realize how old I actually am due to the limited wrinkles on my face.
"Thisis the best moisturizer I've ever used and I've used neutrogena swiss sensitive cream, Lancome moisturizers and others. its the best value at nay price."
I have used this product for about 40 years and have never been
"disappointed. The quality is consistent, to which my 81 year old skin"
is a testament.
This is a great cream for the price. The texture is very rich and thick . I noticed an improvement in my complexion after only a few days of use. Will buy again.
"Great product, love that it is so smooth and creamy, has the ingredients that the more expensive brands have at a fraction of the price, for now ill stick with this! No scent, love it! Especially when they have the special sales, can't beat it!"
"I have used this product (retinol cream) only for several weeks, but I can already see and feel the results on my face. I am in my 60s, and it's really nice to have smooth skin again. This is a great product at a great price."
I have used this product for several years now when I was younger I bough it from a news paper add And later found the web site I think it is awesome I have given this away as gifts to several friends and family members they like it as well
This is the best face cream ever!! I've tried all sorts of products & this one is TOPS! It really does wonders & the price is absolutely AMAZAING!! :):)
"I use this product on my face, neck and chest, especially after a shower. It disappears into the skin and feels great, not greasy. I have been using it for several years and recommend it to my friends."
"I have been using this product for several years. I always like it, but lately the consistency has improved. It used to be a little stiffer, but now it is creamier, and I like that even better. The value is great because I know I am stingier putting a cream on my face and neck that is very expensive. This, I feel like I can use the way it is supposed to be used."
"I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I love it! First of all, the price was right. I love the way it smells and feels when I put it on at night. It absorbs into my skin by the time I lay down and it makes my skin look and feel better. If you are looking for a retinol cream, you can't beat it!"
I saw this when I decided to try the Puritan's Double Vitamin C Serum and decided to give them both a try....I also use a good moisturizer on top...I use the Vit C serum first...then the retinol and then the moisturizer....results have been fantastic...
I have used this cream for weeks and I am very satisfied with the results. It is non greasy and and it feels good and sooting on the skin. I also feel it has helped giving my facial skin a much smoother appearance. I use it daily also on my arms and I am very happy with the results.
"I have noticed a great lessening in the appearance of wrinkles I was beginning to get around my eyes after using this every night. I also use it on the backs of my hands to give them a smoother, younger look. When the weather gets cool enough to wear socks to bed, I'm going to try it on my poor, weathered feet as well."
i just got my order of Retinol Cream to fine out that they changed the size from 8 oz (226g) to 2oz what a difference !
"I do strongly recommend this cream, works so good on my combination skin and leaves my skin so beautiful. I love it."
I have been using this product for over a year with no results. Perhaps you have to be under 60 and don't have wrinkles!
"I am 57 years old, since using this product I am mistaken to be in my 30's!! My skin is softer, smoother and fine lines have disappeared!"
MY WIFE LOVES THIS PRODUCT.WITH USING THIS PRODUCT SHE IS 64 BUT LOOKS 45..SHE ALSO LOVES THE WOMEN`S ULTRA DAILY PACK OF VITAMINS.
"been using the cream for months, my skin feels good, but the fine wrinkles on my cheeks are still the same, zero improvement at 67y/o , ;("
I saw immediate results with this product. I didn't expect results so quickly. Compared to other products on the market this is a great value.
This is definitively my cream. It is better that the creams I used to by for $$ or even for $$$. I would recommend it!!!
"I'M SORRY BUT I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS, SPECIALLY IN LARGE QUANTITIES.. ITS GREASY, AND REALLY DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO YOUR FACE.."
"Retinol A cream leaves my face soft, smooth, and glowing. My friends have begun asking what I use on my skin."
Strangers ask me what I use on my skin because it looks so good. I tell them and tell them how economical it is. I've used it 30+ years.
This cream contains methylparaben. I did not know this until I purchased it and was very disapointed.
"This product is so oily, my make-up slid off my face and I applyed it lightly. It broke my face out it's so greasy. Yuk!"
I started using this 3 weeks ago and have noticed a profound difference in my skin. Amazing product.
"I have used retinol-retina products since the 19800's. This is the best cream and now at 70, I do not have many wrinkles. Love it"
I love the product that I ordered and I also had a an excellent experience with the customer service department.
"I use this cream on my face, neck and chest, and I see great results, still no wrinkles, must follow with SPF, PP has a great price. LUV it."
This product is one of the nicest creams I have ever used. It softens and smooths skin like no other. The price is also amazing.
"Great product. Leaves my skin soft and radiant. A little is all you need. Nice fragrance, non greasy"
"I love this cream. It Is smooth and creamy, but does'nt feel greasy on your skin. For the price this cream Is a must have product."
Best price and quality of anything on the market. I've been using this for at least 11 years and i love it!
I use this cream w/glycerin serum and it works like magic....it has a silky finish and your skin feels like a baby. ...
"I really, really, love this cream I notice and felt a different in my skin in the first week..... I ordered it again..... Thanks"
"Great help for my exposure to wind, sun and salt water while fishing for salmon and crab here in the Pacific Northwest."
"im in love with this cream, i love it , after spending thousands of dollars with so many different creams out there , this does the same or better..."
"I love your product, and I have been a loyal customer for many, many years, my sister and I would never do without your product in our lives."
Just love this product it makes my skin so soft and wrinkles seem to soften. I would recommendit for everyone.
"I really like this, not greasy, absorbs good. I gave my daughter a jar and she has gotten compliments on her skin."
I was not impressed with this cream. I can't see a difference after a whole jar. Felt (and smelled) more like sunscreen than vitamin a cream.
This is the best! It makes a difference in my skin and it's not greasy. I'm glad I bought 3 jars! Wouldn't want to run out.
"This cream is incredible! It is creamy, absorbent, and velvety and has a light fragrance. It is a great value and I am very pleased with it!"
MY SKIN IS SO MUCH BRIGHTER NOW AND MY LARGE PORES HAVE GOTTEN SO MUCH SMALLER .. I USE IT MORNING AND NIGHT AND MY SKIN IS SO SMOOTH NOW...
"when you put it on it seems a bit heavy,but it is absorbed into the skin very nicely. Will purchase again."
I have been using this cream for a few weeks now and I am happy with the results so far. I just wish it was paraben free.
"I have been using this cream for about 15 years. Whenever I have run out, I can see a difference within days. It really works!"
have tried many expensive brand names and nothing beats the product or the price. Got to keep on ordering
This is the best Vitamin E cream I have found. It makes my skin feel soft wihout the greasy feel that most give me. I use it daily on my hands and my lips.
"I had originally bought this product to help with cellulose, but finds it makes my facial skin nice and smooth. I use it nightly, right after I cleanse my face. I also use it on my neck and arms."
"I started using this cream several months ago, and I love it! It hydrates my skin all day. I use this during the day, and the Natural Collagen and Placenta Night Cream at night. Great combo!"
"I love your product, I use it every day and night, I love the feel when I put it on and it blends into my skin so quickly. and leaves no trace., It does not feel greasy, nor messy, I will continue using it, that is my number one beauty trick."
this product works great for me and I will be buying it again. I love this company and their products. I have never been let down by this company or their products.
"This is a super deal. Retinol is considered one of the best skin care creams on the market. If you've done your homework, you know that retinol face products are very expensive. This cream is priced more than right."
"I love this cream...Makes my hands appear smoother and supple, easing wrinkles. Haven't used it that long but hoping it will lessen some wrinkling over time."
"I was a little leary at first about this product, but after trying it I have fell in love with it. I apply it at night before bed. It makes my skin very soft & smooth."
I have used the Retinol cream for 4 years. My skin looks and feels great. I use it on my hands too; they are soft and younger looking. This is a wonderful cream.
Just started using this two weeks ago but already I see a change in the skin. I will continue apply morning and night. Very pleased with this product.
This cream is so awesome!! Its not greasy and a little goes a long way. I dab some on at night and it soaks into my skin to leave it smooth. It immediately softens my skin. I have noticed a big difference since I've been using it. It is the only night cream I will be using from now on. .
"I ordered the same cream last year in 2012, and have loved it. I wanted to re-order them again this year, but the formula changed! If you have used it in the past year, the texture of cream is much thicker and stiffer. It has the same order number, but it is NOT the same product. I am disappointed - if you are returning customer, watch out for change of formula. If you prefer thicker cream, you may not mind the change."
"I bought the retinol cream for my wrinkles but after using it for two months now I havent seen a diiference in my skin, however I love the way the way the cream feels. Its not heavy or greasy & glides on my skin. It seems fresh & light no hidden fragances. For this I will keep using and recommend it to my friends."
"This product has a nice smell and creamy texture. It spreads on skin easily. The one thing I'm not sure I like about it is at first it does feel a bit greasy to the touch after awhile being on the skin, whereas I like a more natural feel, as if I had put nothing on."
"The Puritan's Pride Retinol cream (vitamin a 100,000 iu per ounce) made my skin immediately feel softer and smoother without feeling greasy. I originally purchased this product for my spouse, but tried using it on myself. A very small dab significantly decreased in the appearance of bags under the eyes and crows feet around the eyes. Great product at a great price, especially at buy one, get two free. I highly recommend this product for anyone over 30 who is concerned about wrinkles or bags under the eyes."
I have used a lot of facial creams in my day and really like this cream. It is a really thick cream and goes on smooth.YA little bit of this lotion goes a long way. It seems to really moisturize my face. It is a great night cream. If you use it in the morning you would have to wait a few minutes to put make up on because it does take a bit for it to soak in.
"Puritan's Pride was very helpful and friendly to work with. My package got lost in the mail, and they were wonderful in helping with getting a new package to me. Have just started using product, and like it so far. Looking forward to seeing the long term effects! Good product for the price! Excellent customer service."
"I bought this it really works, i swear by it. iam going to put in a new order."
"only thing I do not like is that it has mineral oil in it, but does have lots of vit. A in it"
I have been buying this product for years and it certainlyhas helped my skin
"Very rich, great for overnight. Pricing and amount are a great deal for retinol cream."
Have enjoyed products for over 30 years - and recommend to all that I know Joan
Retinol cream helps to keep my skin smooth. At age 75 I like people telling me I look young.
It makes my skin nice and smooth. I ordered this product many times over the last a few years.
"My skin f feeling great, but I don't like the fragrance that is in the product."
"I liked it, but I've used better product. But for the price it was OK."

Vitamin A (retinol) is important as we age for our skin and this cream is a very good one.

I have used this product for years. It's excellent in every way.
Originally bought for my wife but this is also a great mens moisturizer
I use it every night. I like how my skin look and feel the next morning.
Seems to be working. Good odor and not heavy. Dark spots appears less noticeable and skin looks smother.
"I bought this cream because of the retinol per ounce ratio. However, I find it to be too heavy for my oily skin. I wish they made this oil-free."
I like the way my face/skin feels the next day after using this cream. I'm glad I started using this product.
"This retinol cream is a great really replenishes your skin. It is not greasy, just enough hydration. Great value, great quality product."
Most health food stores want triple the price. Exceptional value and just what I was looking for. Stasia
I found this cream to be perfect as a night cream and a moisturizer for day use as well. It is excellent quality and the price can't be beat.
"I like this product and have only used it for a few weeks so didn't give it 5 stars. Honestly, I have used a lot of skin care products that cost a lot more and this holds up. I will buy it again."
"Tried to buy the Retinol Lotion for more than a month and a half. Finally I had no choice but to try the Retinol Cream , and it was too Oily feeling and layed on my skin, not being absorbed well."
"It does not work for me - I tried it again and again. It has not done anything to my skin. It didn't make it worse, but it didn't make it better either."
"The Retinol vitaminA face cream is the best!!! I'm a 56 year old man that has never properly cared for his skin, and after using this cream, as directed, my neighbors have commented on how my skin is glowing!"
"I had wanted to try a retinol cream for some time, but did not want to spend a fortune. I use this cream every night and am very pleased with the results."
"I love this lotion. It is a super value & keeps my face looking great. I can't say it is absolutely because of the retinol-a cream, but I am 45 and have almost no wrinkles. I have been using this daily for over 5 years. I love it"
Have been using for about 3 weeks as a night cream and I am very pleased at how my skin feels softer & isn't as dry. I've recommended this product to my daughter who lives in Florida
"This moisturizer is rich, yet quickly absorbed, and I'm delighted with the change it's made in the skin on my face and neck. I love this product, and gave it as gifts at Christmas."
Goes on your skin nice and soaks in fast with no greasy feel. It helps make your pores smaller and your facial skin more uniform in color. great stuff at a great price.
"This is the best cream I have ever tried, by far. I have been using it for several years and I always get compliments on my complexion. You can not find anything better at any price. It quickly absorbs but, is not oily. Highly recommend."
This product is one of the best I have used at any price. I wet my face and then trap the moisture with this night and day cream. I know my skin is protected and always feels so smooth. I Highly recommend using this product.....Paul
This creme smells good and is not greasy. Also it is inexpensive. The true test is to see how well it works. It will take some time for that to be determined.
I love this retinal cream. Makes my skin so soft and supple. My boyfriend can't stop touching my face and neck since I started using it. Thanks Puritans Pride for coming through for me again!
Wow. I was surprised the cream worked since it was very low price. I can now use it on body and hands. Love it. Not greasy. I don't like lotion but I like this product. Puritan customer service is great. Keep up the good work.
"its not heavy on your face, and soaks right in. it really enhances the skin and smells great too. you can put make up on over it too. great for morning and night."
"I didn't expect miracles but I haven't noticed any change in the texture of my skin or decrease in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Not sure that the 100,000 IU per oz. is enough to make any difference in my skin. Will look for another product with higher level of Vit. A when this jar is finished."
"To be honest, I'm not sure this product works. I do like the price and my skin is soft."
I have been using it for ax couple of weeks and have already noticed a difference.
I use it afer shaving and it keeps my skin hydrated band soft
Nice cream!! Not sure that my wrinkles are less but it is a nice cream to put on!
To earlier to fully evaluate but this product seems to help smooth my wife's facial skin.
Felt results immediately -- a little like an egg-white facial. Smoother skin aft. 1 wk's use.
"I love this creme and it works wonders, I use it right after a shower"
"Love this cream, better than the pricy ones and this one does work have been using it for the past 2 years and I love it!"

I am on my third jar. I like the way it feels and smells. I will continue using it. I think it is a good deal.
"Compared to other higher priced products offered to reduce, or reverse anti-aging, this product measures right up there with the best of them."

I recently started using Retinol Cream and I love it. It leaves my face and neck feeling so soft but not greasy as come creams do.

I had been looking for a good moisturizer when I discovered this product. I love it. My face feels smooth and not greasy after using it.
I really like this cream. I havent been using it for very long but I can tell a difference in my skin.
great value.compared to other retinol creams. Didn't care for the smell but would rather have less artificial ingredients to mask that.
"Have been using this product since it's arrival. I just love it , my skin feels good and you just can't beat the price. I'm a convert."
Wise purchase for my aging skin! Mositurizer with Vitamin A and retinol and smells heavenly! I use it every morning and night; the price is right!
I have found pp retinol cream to have met and exceeded my expectations. I received it quickly and it was relatively inexpensive.
"I've only used the product 2 weeks, I use morning and night, I love the testure and the way it goes on. I have good hopes for this product."
"excelent Purchase Ever I had been searching for a product that would help my joints I finally found it.Not only is the quality great, the price can't be beat!"
I purchased the Retinal A cream for my daughter. She has been using this for several years and doesn't use anything else. She thinks it's the best money can buy and always lets me know when she's getting low so that she doesn't run out.
I just started to use this Retinol Cream product as my day make up base. I like it because I got the good deal for a good product. I will definitely recommend to others.
"I was hoping this product would deliver good nutrition to my aging skin. But, it smelled so bad, I had to throw it out.! I tried, and just couldn't get past the awful odor of it. Now I am leery of buying natural products. The reason for the average value, it was cheap. So, I got what I paid for!"
"Made with cheap, crummy, low quality filler -- greasy, not skin friendly MINERAL OIL. AVOID."
"My wife feel fool satisfaction with the results to her face, so and me."
I will use everyday. I see a big decrease in lines. love this cream!
"began using this a couple of weeks ago and found it amazing., good price., good product"
"It goes on silky smooth, and is not heavy. I have been very pleased with the results."
I have used this product for 15+ years and would recommend highly.
Smooth and quick absorbing. Not heavy or greasy. And results are obvious quickly. Love it
"So good for my skin, I've been using it for more than 15 years!"
I haven't been using this one very long but it does seem to be an excellent value.
Have used two jars so far----. I find my skin to be smoother. Great under makeup!
What a great feel to my skin! So Soft! Fine wrinkles plump up and are less visible!
I felt this product to nourish and moisturize my face for the whole day.
so far so good ....nothing neg to say so far...it does make my skin super soft.
"Great value, excellent hydration, pleasant scent and fast and easy ordering and delivery."
Non greasy is the best part of using this face cream. Soaks in leaving a smooth feeling. Very affordable. Highly recommend.
I can see a difference - I am so pleased with my Puritans Pride Retinol cream that I hope to purchase more in the future. Thank you.
I have been using this the the dmae cream for about 4 months I am happy with the results
I use on my face & neck & hands
Love the cream. Only cream that truly works. Shared it with my young adult daughter and she now chooses to use it also.
I have been using the creams on my face and neck for years. I love the price of their vitamins!!! Wonderful Company!
I can't say that I think it has made my face look younger but it does make it feel so so soft. I do give it a thumb's up.
I've been using this product for many years and have never been unhappy with the quality. Goes on nice and is absorbed quickly.
Retinol when exposed to air is weakened and the packaging on this product may be compromised. With other retinols I tend to get a good peel of older cells that does not appear to happen with this product.
This product doesn't have the most pleasant smell but I mix it in with my hand lotion and I see a difference. Thanks for supplying such a good product.
I'm just used for 3 week ..The way that I buyers it because I'm believe in yours reviews.
Good product using it for years makes skin smooth and looks healthy
"Product seems to be fine, just started using it so no details as of yet but so far so good."
USE THIS CREAM ON FACE OR WHEREVER MOISTURE IS NEEDED
"This is an excellent purchase -- good quality, wonderful price and quick delivery! Thank you!"
haven't been using it for long but like the way it softens my skin
"I have been using this product for some time now, and will continue to. That says it all.."
"The product is smooth and not greasy. Great value, reasonable cost. Use it every morning."
"not greasy, apply at night, skin feels soft and smooth. My sister and my daughter ages 68 and 43 are well pleased with the same results."
"I haven't use this long enough to tell about lasting effects, but I like using it as a moisturizer"
I use this cream for my face where I have thin skin and believes it helps... to each their own?
Excellent product. Review too sort?! O.k. (last time). This is an excellent product.
This retinal cream is great along with the price. I will be this cream again when I run out.
