"The consistency is just right, not to heavy for a sunscreen I really love it!!"
"I really love this moisturizer- it is so easy to apply and smooth over my face, it has a pleasant and light scent, and I love that it has SPF and helps to combat wrinkles. This leaves my skin feeling soft and looking dewy, and I love wearing it under my foundation & primer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
absolutely loved this product. I thought the moisturizer was going to be completely oily as it felt a bit liquid-y but was pleasantly surprised. It didn't have a distinct smell to it and applied smoothly I used it under my makeup with no problems.
Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Wrinkle Daily Moisterizer with Sunscreen goes on smooth & feels good. All in all a great SPF moisterizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer did leave my skin feeling smoother, and it is absorbed easily. A little bit goes a long way, so this tube will last a while. Although I'm not a fan of the scent (I typically prefer unscented lotions/moisturizers), it doesn't linger long so I forget about it as soon as I'm out the door."
Would definitely recommend and will probably make this my daily moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product was so lightweight it was light wearing nothing. I expected it to feel greasy since it has sunscreen in it but it wasn't. It was so smooth. The only thing I'd change is the odor. It's not bad, just not like the iconic Pings cold cream."
"This one was a pleasant surprise for me - I expected the sunscreen to leave a white cast since it is zinc/titanium dioxide but it really leaves a nice finish on my skin - not too white and moisturizing without being too oily. The only thing that I wish for in this product was a fragrance free version. The scent is not bad, but I prefer scent free products and it is safer overall to avoid fragrance in skincare products since you could develop a fragrance allergy."
Most moisturizer I have used kinda felt greasy but this didn't and it also made my pores look smaller not sure how considering it's for wrinkles
I like this product very much. It leaves the skin nice an soft. The only thing I didn't care for was the medicinal smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product did not work well for me. I only used a small amount and I ended up looking as white as a ghost. This is coming from a dark skinned black woman. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"THIS PRODUCT IS LIGHT ON OU SKIN YET KEEPS YOUR SKIN MOIST. OTHER PRODUCTS I HAVE USED WERE HEAVY AND LEFT AN OIL FLIM. I FOUND THIS PRODUCT IS PERFECT ALSO AS A PRIMER FOR POWDER MAKE UP. ON TOP OF BEING SO LIGHT I USE IT IN THE AM, AFTER A WORK OUT AND BEFORE BED. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It goes on nice and feels good on my skin. It's not to heavy and doesn't feel like you have to much on. It is just a little greasy feeling but not bad. I like that it does have SPF in it because that is very important to me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using the next day I received it on the mail. I recommend this product, it is not only a sunscreen but also a moisturizer. Your skin doesn't feel or looks as with the regular sunscreen. I used mine every day before going out and seems to work. Thank you Ponds! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I did not like this because it dried my face out and left a powder like residue on it. I will stick to my Ponds cold cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This product was amazing. I can feel my face soft and looks more white.i really recomend this sunscreen [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin felt smooth and silky soft. Easy to use. l
I like how it does not feel heavy like some products with sunscreen do. It provides very good moisture for my skin during these cold months.
Does a good job for the most part. Not too thick. A little bit goes a long way. I like that. The smell isn't terrible but I don't love it either.
Great application very hydrating cleared up alot of my dark spots and uneven tone [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
