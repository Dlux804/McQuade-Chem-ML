"It clumps and I wonder if it's old, but it feels like that wherever I order it from it leaves these coloured balls on my arms and it doesn't dissolve into my skin. Yet I order it over & over! We will see the end result. Yes it's achieved the result in the end every time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product makes my skin smooth, clear and even."
pleasant smell. goes on easy and skin stays hydrated.
I have been using this product for some years now and people always tell me I have great skin and want to know what skin care product I use. I tell them Skin Success Anti-Dark Spot Fade Cream. I have tried other skin care products but I always end up going back to Skin Success Anti-Dark Spot Fade Cream.
I use this during the winter months to help even out any blotchy tones I have when transitioning from my summer tan. If you use this along with the soap you will definitely notice a difference. Just don't use it after shaving or waxing as it can cause some irritation. If anyone is wondering I have medium/tan skin.
"I've been using this product for many years, not only even tone my face skin, but also remove the freckles and other dark spots from my face and neck."
"I use Palmer's Fade Milk with a daily anti-aging body scrub and body brush. My skin has a beautiful even glow, retains moisture and extremely smooth to the touch."
I really wasn't going to write a review until they asked me for one.
"We have different skin, and all tend to react differently in my case this lotion did not work for me at all other lotion from another company overproduced. I had to mix the Palmer's lotion and the other lotion to get the result I was anticipating."
"I used for a couple days and started to see a rash develop and itch, redness around the area where applied. I stopped using and the rash eventually went away. There was a medicinal smell to the lotion, not very pleasing."
"A week after I bought this product it began turning into a dark brown colour. Not sure if that is normal. However, it did not fade any of my dark marks, figure it is not meant for brown skin tones"
I had dark spot all over my back and this lotion clear it all up. Now I'm not ashamed to show my back anymore.
"A very good product, Got it a month ago and I've already seen signs of the my blemishes fading away...."
I've been using for some years and still in love. I've also introduced my family and friends to it since they love how beautiful my skin looks!!
"Works great! My skin looks beautiful, toned and moisturized!"
I love it.
Thank you! Great product. .............
"If they would add more Retinol or Hydroquinone, it would be more effective."
This product really helps brighten your skin tone and fades acne scars!
