"This product has improved the quality of my skin by a great portion. Ever since I use this, my skin has never had: excess oil, dryness, or irritation. I would recommend this and all products from Neutrogena® for treating acne."
"I was initially skeptical to apply a moisturizer, but this works fabulously, not greasy, and keeps away breakouts."
"My mom bought this product for me and I have started to use it 3 days ago. I used this product with the foaming scrub and rapid clear from Neutrogena. My face has started to clear up! Even after 3 days, my face has started to feel so fresh! Thank you Neutrogena for clearing up my skin!"
I bought this a couple months ago and absolutely love it. Make sure you use an acne cleanser as well . I highly recommend Neutragena Stubborn Acne too!! They are all amazing!
This works way better than any sallylic acid face wash I've tried. Within two days after using it two of my pimples formed a head. I put it on at night. I will mention that I've seemed to develop a couple of tiny tiny bumps on the lower part of my cheek which are typically dry and acne-free. I think they're going away though this is only my third day using this product. For this price this is a good product.
My acne has decreased a lot and my skin feels great
I have tried so many things to get rid of my acne and I have really bad acne so I found this and I thought I'd try it.The third day I saw a big improvement my acne was almost gone I absolutely love this product but I don't recommend putting this on skin that's clear it will make your skin peal.
"I'm hoping this product will work out in the long term. For years I have been very satisfied with a different face lotion sold by neutragena. Unfortunately it has been more and more difficult to find. I'm a little scared that it may be discontinued! The lotion I have used in the past has 2%salisilic acid. This one only has .5%. That's a huge difference! I'm hoping this one works out in the long run, but that remains to be seen."
Is there anyway that neutragena could bring back the other one?
"I bought this about 2 months ago and used it along with another moisturizer I always use, and love. When I used it, I woke up the next morning with what I can't tell were pimples or hives. The following morning was even worse. I stopped using it for about a month and tried it once more just in case it was a one time thing; and it happened again!"
I bought this product a month ago and tried out. It make my skin so much changed and clear. I would recommend this product. But i have a question if my skin have no more acne can i still continue using this product? because that cream make my skin peal. Btw i'm so in love with it don't wanna stop using it.
"I'm old, 63 to be exact, and still getting more breakouts than when I was young. I hate to not moisturize because I'm not really oily, I have normal skin. This has seemed to stop the deep, sore pimples and keeps my makeup looking good longer. I'm very pleased with my new skincare."
My face is so oily especially when applying makeup. I saw this moisturizer online and gave it a try and I love the results.. totally worth it
I bought this product about two weeks ago and worked it into my daily skincare routine and I absolutely love it. My acne is starting to clear up and my face looks great!
"I used this before I knew more about skin care. I don't like the fragrance and it's just an unnecessary ingredient. The texture is nice and it does smooth into the skin nicely. However, this caused my skin major irritation. I know it's not the salicylic acid in it. It has to be the fragrance. It's basically like spraying perfume on your face"
"I am very satisfied with this moisturizer! It doesn't make my skin greasy, leaves my skin moist, and it smells heavenly. My only problem with it is that I have to put on more moisturizer than I would prefer for it to work, but that's probably just me. Just make sure you test the product on one part of your face once a day for a couple days to make sure that you don't have a bad reaction to it."
"This product made my entire face break out in a red, itchy rash, and made my face very swollen. I don't really understand, since I've used nothing but Neutrogena products as my skincare for years. I'm allergic to benzoyl peroxide, but didn't see that ingredient listed on the bottle. The rash lasted for two entire days, and even now it hasn't gone away. It's left my skin dry and itchy, and I'm very disappointed."
"I had a breakout on my face that had lasted almost 10 months, and other pimples that popped up around my face regularly. I have tried a few different acne creams and when I tried this, I noticed results immediately! The breakout cleared, with only a few remaining (as I'be been using this for 3 days only I'm sure they will be the next ones to go. Amazing product, and affordable price!"
"My skin is super oily and greasy and gets really bad pimples and redness in the summer. After a week, I noticed my skin was softer, the pimples were gone and my skin was a lot less oily. It is a nice smelling, soft, non greasy lotion that works with minimal product leaving you with more for your money. Love it!"
"Bought this product after doing some research!! I made the decision on purchasing this product and along with the other pink grapefruit products. By day four I notice a difference in my skin! Started to look soft, blemish free, red pimple free and not over drying my face!! I will be using this product and others from the pink grapefruit line"
I highly recommend this to anyone that has oily and acne prone skin!!!
It definitely moisturized my skin without leaving the greasy feeling. I had a small break out when it arrived so I tried it out for the rest of the week. It didn't really help clear my breakout. It dried up some of the area but I broke out even more after applying it in my oily tzone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had some fresh acne on my face, so I used the moisturizer. It wemt away in 2 days. It didn't my skin dry instead provide the just the right amount of moisturization. I am not sure if it's good for daily use when I don't have any break outs [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Absolutely in love! I struggle with persistent acne, oiliness, and dry patches and this product is the relief I desperately needed. I've been using this product for months and I can honestly say that this is phenomenal! I wash my face and apply this twice daily and it leaves my skin silky and smelling great. It keeps my acne under control and although it doesn't completely get rid of my acne, I no longer get huge breakouts! Well done Neutrogena! Would definitely recommend!!!"
"Wow, this moisturizer works amazing for me! I've been prone to very dry skin, but this moisturizer keeps my skin smooth and not looking greasy! This moisturizer seems to apparently be helping my stubborn mild breakouts as well. I use this twice a day after washing with Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Wash and my results are pretty good!! I can't speak for everyone who uses this, but I definitely recommend!"
"I absolutely love this product! I bought it a couple of months ago to try it out and I fell in love with it. Previously, after 4 hours of putting on moisturizer my skin was super oily and shiny, but with this product, my skin becomes a little oily in 8 hours! It is also amazing for clearing acne and marks. I use it in the morning and at night paired with the Acne Stress Control cleanser, which is also amazing."
"i have been using this product for a year now and i haven't had any problems with it but last night i used it after a shower and this morning i woke up with my face all red, my eyes were burning, and i was crying. So right now i'm not very happy with this product."
"I have used several brands of moisturizers and face washes over the years and they either left my face feeling oily/greasy or dried my skin out. Thank goodness for Neutogena! This moisturizer plus their grapefruit exfoliating face wash has replaced my flakey, blemished and sometimes oily face with clear, smooth skin. I have used this duo for several years and now have started to use their serums to tackle those faint, but annoying little wrinkles. I am a Neutrogena girl for life!"
"I started to use this one like a moisturizer (duh) before the on-the-spot acne cream but my skin is a little sensitive so my face was really dry the first days. i had to apply this one like 4 times a day for like 3 days to have a normal skin again. but this two products control my acne very well so i'm gonna still using it, and i love the grapefruit smell of this moisturizer"
"After two uses, I was breaking out on my cheeks with rashes. I didn't think this was it, but I've never had this happen to me before. Then, I saw several posts where others had the same occurrence. Wouldn't recommend at all. Didn't work my skin, but may work for yours. Just do your research before buying anything!!"
"I bought this awhile back to check it out because I had seen other people use it. The first day I used it I woke up with new painful pimples on my forehead, I continued to use it thinking that it wasn't the thing that caused it. My skin continued getting worse so I stopped and it returned back to normal. I then tried it again, to give it another chance and like the first time, it broke me out. Wanted this product to work because my skin is very acne prone."
Ive been using this for a while and every time i use it i have to use dermasil day cream because this product dries out my face. I was thinking about getting a cetaphil moisturizer instead.
i brought this a year ago and it worked amazingly. i also purchased another one just 4 days ago and the change in my extreme spotty skin is wonderful within 4 days it's cleared and i have 0 spots!!! highly recommended.
I have tried many types of acne moisturizers and this is by far my favorite one. This product smells great and helps my acne stay under control as well as disappear.
my skin has cleared up a lot since I used this product. feeling softer. not as oily. I even made my son use it to clear his up as well it doing wonders.
I bought the product for my daughter and she has been using it for about a week. I have noticed her skin is softer and has not had any break outs. She likes the product and can't wait to find it in stores!!
This is a good product. My only complaint is that it goes on feeling a little greasy which you usually don't get with an oil free lotion. I also wish it was a bit more moisturizing to my dry facial skin.
I recived this as a free sample and omg the smell is so good I use it after I shower and it has made my face a lot clearer it doesn't leave it greasy at all I would definitely keep buying this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Non greasy light weight and clear my breakouts I wished I found about this earlier I love this so so much I have oily sensitive skin and I can't live without this!!!!!!
This is an okay face lotion. It is for acne but I don't feel it really helps in treating or preventing breakouts. The smell is absolutely wonderful though!
"I used this product on my cheeks and nose, and broke out in a rash across the entire area. I've used products with salicylic acid before, so I'm not sure what ingredient caused the reaction, but it has lasted several hours."
Neutrogena Oil-Free Acne Moisturizer Pink Grapefruit feels incredibly lightweight and not greasy at all. You are moisturizing and treating existing acne plus preventing future breakouts!
I started using this product about 5 days ago and i can already see my skin improving. It is so much softer than it used to be. There is little to no redness with my pimples too. I'm so happy that i got this product and i highly recommend it.
"I have been using it for almost two weeks i thought it would moisturize my skin and help my breakout, but it made it ten times worse! I am very mad, I hoped this product help."
I just bought this item because I took the quiz neutrogena has on there website & it recommended the grapefruit moisturizer & I absolutely love it! It makes my skin feel so soft refreshed!
I used this for a week and I am not joking my entire face is peeling off. It's terrible. It's supposed to moisturize but instead it completely dries out your face in the end causing MORE acne. Maybe that's what they meant by “acne moisturizer”.
I recieved this fast and I like it it smells like grapefruit. I mix it with Vitamine E oil and apply it to my face. The two gives your skin a nice glow.
"This stuff actually works wonders for my skin. It has helped my skin become more clear. I use it two times a day. Its not the best at keeping moisture in, as sometimes my face feels dry afterwards but overall, it has been great. I am getting a little sick of the scent. It gets old after a while."
I have been out of this product and cannot find it.
Love it so much it's super moisturizing and I love using it every night
"The Neutrogena oil free acne moisturizer was a good staple in my skin care. I'm glad I got to try this product, because now I get to use it on my face everyday and it doesn't leave my skin feeling dry (which I have dryness of the skin) and non oily. Thank you for letting me try this product. I recommend to anyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My cheeks are usually the most dry spots on my face, and this moisturiser really did help when the dry spots were getting too harsh. When applying it onto the skin, it feels like a light coat - not greasy at all! My oily forehead also benefited from this product!"
"Lately, I have suffered from acne and it was always so frustrating having to put a moisturizer and then my foundation just to cover up my acne. With Neutrogena Oil-free Acne Correct and Cover up I can moisturize and cover up at the same time and it goes on light and looks great, leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth and I love the scent! I recommend this to everyone who suffers from acne and I love Neutrogena, they are the best products nest to Olay"
"I'm wantint to buy this product for after I cleanse my face, is this a cream ?"
I am a teenager with acne problems but when I used this it helped to clear my skin.... It makes my face not only look soft but to feel soft also!!!
MY DAUGHTER WILL NOT GO OUT WITHOUT THIS MOISTURIZER. IT CONTROLS BREAKOUTS AND IT HAVE A LOVELY SMELL.
It is light and has a refreshing scent. It leaves my skin feeling soft and fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This lotion smells great!
It left skin smooth and not greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Dried my skin out and caused painful breakouts all over. Left my skin feeling more oily and clogged.
"It's a no frills moisturizer for acne prone skin, doesn't clog pores, see for yourself! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I borrowed some from a friend and was instantly hooked. It's the only one that does its job and clears breakouts
This is good it cleared help clear up my breakout with my daily routine I think you should give it a try
Estuve varias semanas utilizándolo y si eliminaba algunas espinillas pero reseco mi nariz y barbilla hasta crear un color obscuro en esas zonas
Tenía la piel mejor antes de empezar a usarlo
"I bought this 2 weeks ago and my face wasn't dry at all ,and it had like no acne! I used it everyday and now my face is super dry and I have more acne now"
"I used this moisturizer and my skin broke out in a rash. It made my skin inflamed and itchy. I loved the smell of this product and was hoping for the best, but this product just did not work for me."
"As with really anything from neutrogena I would reccomend this product.the only downside is I felt like there wasn't much of a kick in this moisturizer, it was a little lifeless but worked well alongside the rest of the product line."
"Great moisturizer for medium to oily skin, Didn't make my face feel so dry and gave me the perfect hydration it needed! Smells amazing. Will be buying again. Can't wait for more results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been really enjoying the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Moisturizer. It made my skin feel so soft and hydrated, it also slightly helped me with my breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used this product in the past and recommend it for anyone who is acne-prone and prefers their moisturizer thinner and less oily. The only issue I had with this product was that it didn't really help with my acne and the smell was a bit unnecessary since I prefer scentless face products.
My skin is abnormally oily and will always be because of genetics. Most products targeted for acne prone skin don't work. They either are too harsh or too greasy. I use this along w/ other Neutrogena products. I love their products and especially this moisturizer! I feel like Neutrogena is the only brand that truly understands the balance very oily skin needs. Thank you Neutrogena!
"My skin doesn't get big break outs or even more than a few small bumps a month around my period. However, this moisturizer kept even my few period bumps away! My skin didn't feel dry or greasy at all, just soft and supple! I absolutely love the smell, the feel and the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this product. The product felt non-greasy and hydrated my combination skin. My skin is also acne-prone and I felt as though the salicylic acid in the moisturizer helped to soothe it! Will definitely repurchase when I'm out of product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this moisturizer once and her whole face had a reaction to it. I woke up with a swollen eye and then later that day my face broke out with little bumps all over it. I discontinued use but it has been 3 days and I still have the bumps. Not sure what to do for them. I usually have great results from your products.
I've used this product for years and it's simply the best there is for oily skin. I also have rosacea therefore my skin is sensitive. This doesn't irritate or burn. I find the smell to be quite pleasant. The off brands of this product simply don't compare. Worth the extra money.
"I bought this moisturizer a few weeks ago, and ever since my breakouts have been decreasing everyday, and even when it's that time of the month from mother nature, I've noticed that the breakouts don't last nearly as long as they used to. 110% Amazing Product. I only hope they'll look into a Glycolic Acid Mosturizer next."
"Good Afternoon, I don't like this product because it gave me an allergic reaction today. So last night after I took a shower, I used this and in the morning when I woke up my face was all red, and my eyes were burning so basically I would be crying every few seconds, and I had a runny nose. I don't understand because I've used this product before yesterday and nothings happened, espeacially for early teens."
This stuff is awesome. My mom loves to it when she comes over.
I bought this a month ago and it made my skin breakout way more
It smells soooo good and it makes my skin feel so good and awake!
I liked the top can be locked and unlocked so it can be put in a bag so it does spill
I bought this yesterday with the exfoliating scrub. I noticed a difference right away in my skin. It mosturizes without overdrying.
This lotion actually broke me out and caused irritation. I would recommend the hydro boost water gel instead 100%.
It works pretty well and I love the smell! Other people complained that it irritated their skin but I didn't have any problems.
This product leaves my skin feeling more dry making my skin produce more oil. It doesn't absorb well into the skin.
This moisturizer combined with the grapefruit face wash make a perfect pair. My skin is clear and smells great.
It works it feels like my skin is clearing from breakouts [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recently bought the grapefruit moisturizer for the first time and I'm impressed with this product. It doesn't leave a greasy shine or feel heavy after applying. Also was reasonably priced.
"I was breaking out a lot, because of my oily skin. I found this product and started using it, within a week, my skin started clearing up. Not only does it help with acne but also contains SPF to protect you from the sun."
I just like this product for moisturizingvand it is not greasy . For clearing the acne doesn't do any thing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Neutrogena seems to be my favourite brand, everything I get to try by brand becomes my every day routine helpers. This one moisturizer not an exeption, this my fav for sunny days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Loved it. I saw a difference after the first use. Didn't dry my skin out like most products do. And my face felt fresh and super clean. I'm going to buy when this one is gone. Thank you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"The oil free acne moisturizer saved my skin, this summer. It being so dry my skin would be uncomfortable so the non greasy formula added comfort to my face with a pleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the product for awhile now and I absolutely love it! I use it twice a day in the morning and at night it moisturizes my skin without making it greasy which I love, PLUS IT SMELLS AWSOME!!"
I bought this moisturizer because of the great reviews tried it and made my skin breakout very bad I have tried other Neutrogena products and they all seem to make me breakout. It would be nice if we could get some sort of refund because I've tried different moisturizer and spent money and can't use it since it makes me breakout.
"I recently had bought this moisterizer, the acne skin cleanser, and the on the spot acne treatment and my skin has become super sesitive. I had a lot of acne on my chin and that was the main place I put these proctucts and my skin had started burning, and my face got super dry. Although i do see a difference in my skin it has become more clear."
"Overall if felt okay on my skin. The smell was really strong and at times after application my skin would burn. However, the moisturizer is very light and does not feel heavy on the skin especially for those with more oily prone skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love Neutrogena® Oil-Free Acne Moisturizer Pink Grapefruit. It is now going to replace my go-to moisturizer. Not only does it smell great, but it keeps my skin clear and moisturized! I used it in the morning and at night. It was a great refreshing way to wake me up and to also wind me down to go to bed. I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found that I really like this acne moisturizer. I have dry skin and though it's not the most hydrating moisturizer, it isn't super drying either. It's more moisturizing than most acne moisturizers I've used and I really love that. I can definitely see myself purchasing it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was hesitant on trying the moisturizer because I had a bad reaction to the grapefruit facewash, but thankfully I didn't have a reaction to it. I am pleasantly surprised at how hydrated my skin feels and how well it got rid of dry patches. This moisturizer soaked into my skin and left it very soft, however I still get oily after a couple hours. I will definitely keep using this product and wait to see my skin in a few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My face gets really dry after I wash it, I started to put this on it everyday, It's super light and oil free. Seconds after putting it on, you can't even feel it. You don't get that heavy/creamy feeling.it's great for daily moisturizing. I received the product for free, but my review is 100% honest [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Haven't tried it long enough to see any changes BUT this would be my number one pick if there was SPF added to this. I cannot wear this everyday due to SPF not being included. I won't add layers and layers of creams and product to my face. I would like just one option. If this had SPF 15 or 30, this would always be my go to and the only moisturizer I would by. I also love love love the scent! Light but fragrant! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was so excited when I received the email that I would be getting this to try out for free but I was a little skeptical on if it would actually keep my skin moisturized needless to say it does the trick and it smells amazing. The fact that it fights acne as well is an added bonus that I am very happy about. I will be adding this to my normal every day skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is definitely the best moisturizer for people with acne. It softens the skin, absorbs readily without any greasy residue. I personally didn't like the grape fruit smell, but the product delivers as promised. Would definitely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Neutorgena is a staple brand in my home but this product really excited me. Not only does it hydrate without giving an oily look or feel but the smell is awesome. I highly recommend this product and will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have never tried anything like it. When I think of product that fight the acne on my face I usually get dry skin in the process. Neutrogena not only cleans and helps with the acne on my face but it also leaves mu face very soft. I love it and recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"As soon as I received my package I knew I was up to something good. I couldn't wait to use the bottle, I took off the cap and the scent is amazing. It's almost as if I was smelling a real grapefruit. When I put it on my face it felt so cool and hydrated, the pimples have gone away faster. Thank-you to Home Tester Club and Neutrogena who provided me with a free sample in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the Neutrogena Oil Free Acne Moisturizer Pink Grapefruit. It felt really good on my skin and made it feel fresh and hydrated. I love that Pink Grapefruit scent too. The product did seem to help with breakouts and helped to clear them up faster. The product itself was light on my skin, and did not leave my skin with a greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved it. Smelled great too. No greasy residue and left my skin moisturized. I have a very sensitive acne prone skin. And have used many expensive name brands. But this works quite well as actually even better than some! It calms my skin, makes it unbelievably softer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This smells amazing! The sent is very light and not over powering. A little goes a long way. It feels okay on your face but I think it is kind of greasy. I didn't see any results as to clearing acne either but maybe it will help over time. I did like how moisturized my face was after using it though. You also have to make sure that it is completely dry before you can apply any foundation as it makes it cakey and streaky if you don't. Overall i would reccomend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The smell is amazing. Usually these products make my face “burn”, but this one didn't. My face felt so amazingly soft afterwards also. I will definitely be buying this product."
My son & husband tried it as well. And both loved it. So it's a big hit in our home! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is all that it says, my daughter's skin is clear of pimples after just 3 uses and it's not dry at all! I will continue to buy this product since it works better than all we tried. I definitely recommend giving it a try. Very pleased overall. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It has a refreshing smell, my skin felt soft and hydrated, I like the shape of the bottle and that it was pink, my favorite color. I could smell grapefruit for some time after I put it on my face, and I liked that. I will reccomend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm 58 and tried this and love it! Dry inexpensive compared to others...was skeptical but so love it...keeps my skin clearer and moisturized. I can add maracuja oil to it in winter if I need to, but this really surprised me, cause I was trying to save money and it works just as good as really expensive products!"
"This Neutrogena pink grapefruit oil free acne moisturizer is amazing! My skin feels so smooth, clean, glowing, hydrated, and healthy. And it smells fantastic, with perfect notes of grapefruit. No oily residue left behind, goes on easy and washes of smooth and clear. This face product is amazing for skin prone to breaking out. I will absolutely be buying this product in the future and I definitely recommend you give it a try. A+++ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this 2 weeks ago and have been using Day and night. I had a few small pimples before deciding to give this a try. However, since using this my face is horrible! I am 28 and didn't have this bad of acne even in high school! I stopped using it 2 days ago and already my skin is starting to clear up some. This made my skin super oily!!!! Every ones skin is different but this absolutely made my face worse then it has ever been! I'm extremely dissapointed!"
"I don't like the feel of it, but even worse is the ""fragrance"". At first you think it smells like grapefruit, but in a couple seconds you realize it has a horrible smell like some sort of chemical. I tried to give it away, and nobody will even take it because of the awful smell. Money wasted!!!"
I love the smell of this product and it feels light weight on my face. I'm glad it's oil free. It doesn't seem to work as a moisturizer as much as I hoped and I did get a pimple with this. So I will get another moisturizer for my face in the future. But if you Iike grapefruit smell or have a real acne problem this might be for you too drying for me. Great price too.
"I have very, very oily skin. I was in the market to find a lightweight oil free moisturizer. I could not find one that was affordable and water based. Lo and behold, I found this moisturizer. I fell in love with it. It smells awesome. My skin feels so smooth. This is a great product. I will definitely be using for a long time."
This moisturizer leaves my skin very soft and pleasantly smelling. It's non-greasy and gets absorbed quickly into the skin.

"Non greasy, fast absorbing and calmed my acne. I started breaking out in my jaw area suddenly, and this lotion helped tremendously. I used it under my daily SPF lotion in the morning and at night, under my night cream."
"I bought this product a little less than a week ago, and I've been using it ever since along with the face wash that also contains grape fruit. But the only problem is that it makes my face dry which I dislike. I'm not sure if I should stop using it because of this, any suggestions?"
MOISTURIZER? MORE LIKE DEHYDRATOR! I'M A VERY OILY PERSON AND I'M SO BAMBOOZLED AS TO HOW THIS LEFT ME FLAKIER THAN SOME GOLD FISH FOOD. EVEN THOUGH IT PROVIDES A THIN LAYER OF PRODUCT IT STILL MANAGED TO STRIP ALL MOISTER FROM FACE. I'VE SWITCHED TO SIMPLE AND I'M GLAD I DID! NATURAL FORMULAS FTW!!
