I got this product for my 40 year old husband. He's is it on a daily basis and absolutely loves it. It has a nice scent. This moisturizer not only waste raises your face it also has sunscreen of an SPF of 15. This is great for anyone with sensitive skin or regular. I would highly recommend this to Any Man of any age. Great product
"I tried this product for about two weeks and works very good, I am getting old and obviously with the age the wrinkles are coming and dry skin, my experience with this product in just two I can see the results, I am loosing my wrinkles. This product really works, I think if this the results in just two weeks, how good would be longer?"
"Neutrogena Men Age Fighter Face Moisturizer With Sunscreen Broad Spectrum Spf 15, 1.4 Oz. Easy to apply makes you skin feel good. Not sure if I have seen a difference but only been using for 2 weeks. I does protect from sun with sunscreen SPF 15 protection, which prevents further damage. It has Retinol which I have heard is good for your face skin."
"Neutropenia Men Age Fighter Face Moisturize with sunscreen Broad Spectrum. I'm very happy about this product. It feels nice when applied to your skin, and this feeling remains for several seconds. It doesn't leave any resídue and it works for me very well. I can see and feel a difference skin texture. I used it to get rid of flakiness and redness and also is general moisturizer. It is just the right consistency. The scent is very good . After a few weeks I look at least 10 year younger . I really recommend it ... this is my husband words !"
"I've gone through one tube of this product. It feels reasonably light on the skin, not too greasy. It's hard to tell how well it fights aging of course. My main complaints are that it's a bit pricey for the relatively small quantity and that the tube started to leak where it got bent after awhile, so the packaging could use some work."
"As a guy, lotions are the only thing we can use to protect our skin and keep us from looking older than we are. I had used a prior company for years but found they no longer exist. Luckily I found Neutrogena products for men (Age Fighter and Face Lotion). I have used these products for over a year now and found them both superior and cheaper than my prior company. Hopefully you will keep creating and expanding men specific products."
Highly recommend this. Works great on sensitive skin as it does not cause breakouts at all. Terrific daily moisturizer and sunscreen. Does not feel greasy at all.
I have been using both the shaving cream and the Age Fighter for many years it has helped my skin stay moist and protects me from the outdoor sun .
I use this everyday after I was using face wash and it keeps my skin feeling soft. I haven't notice signs that it has help with fighting aging skin. It smells like regular cream. I love the fact that it is SPF 15. The moisturizer doesn't level my face feeling greasy. All in all its good for making your skin feel soft and protecting your face from the sun.
"This is a good supplement to use in your wrinkle fighting daily regiment. It's not a miracle product by any means, but it most certainly does help. Goes on clean and drys quickly. Not too overwhelming of a scent at all. Sunscreen is a bonus. Make sure if you are actually going to be out in the sun to put it on evenly or you could have some sunburn marks where spots were missed. Good middle of the road cost effective men's facial moisturiser."
"There is no man in my household, so i am using this product myself! Although i have used prescription Retinol in the past, it left my skin red and peeling.Neutrogena Men Age Fighter Moisturizer With SPF 15 is designed for men, it is a GREAT anti wrinkle Retinol facial moisturizer for anyone who wants younger looking skin ! The added benefit of having an SPF 15 included is one less step in skincare,you need to do, i LOVE it,and see and feel a difference in my face already, this is a keeper!"
"My husband tried this product a couple times - he used it after he shaved. He said the moisturizer itself left his skin feeling okay, pretty smooth. The product has a nice creamy texture. However, he couldn't get past the smell. There's SPF in the moisturizer, and you can definitely tell. Having a sunscreen smell right by your nose (since it's a facial moisturizer) is very off-putting."
This is a nice item from Neutrogena. It is an age fighter face moisturizer with sunscreen for men. It is a thick cream that blends in well. It has Retinal Multi-Vitamins to help reduce the look of fine lines and wrinkles.
The SPF 15 helps prevent sunburn to further protect your skin.
Nice item for men who want to improve their skin.
"i use this every day , i like the fact that it is not a greasy / oily moisturizer / sunscreen, it does'nt smell like many others, it only takes 2 or 3 minutes for it to soak into you're skin so nobody will know it's on, the Spf 15 sunscreen is a great added benefit,"
"Got this for my nearly 73 year old husband so he would stop using all my moisturizer products mostly. He constantly complains of dry skin on his face and it does get red and irritated a lot. H used this for about a week now and he wants a case of it! It is working for him like nothing else. We've had cold, windy weather in the Northeast and....no complaints! His face isn't all red and flakey and he really looks much better! He's happier doing outside chores without the dry skin issues! It works!"
This product is great for someone that doesn't ever worry about putting moisturizer or sunscreen to begin with. So to have a moisturizer with sunscreen for a man is a great idea. Simple thing to use and smells good
My husband uses this Neutrogena facial moisturizer every day!! He also plays golf 3 to 4 times a week and is constantly in the sun. This moisturizer smell great too.
"My husband has never used facecream before, but he really like this one! He just started using it a few days ago- and says he likes the feel of it! I would recommend."
"I am neutrogena user since i came here in US, im glad my husband do too. He use anti aging that his son gave to him. Im glad Walmart has this on the free list. My husband couldn't happier."
Only SPF 15 so it offers little protection. It is basically a face cream that doesn't contain any retinol listed on the active ingredients. So I didn't notice any reduction in lines & wrinkles. There wasn't a detectable scent from the product.
"Although this says moisturizer, on the bottle it clearly states"
That it is sunscreen. You can use this as moisturizer after shower.
Overall its great.
"It leaves you with the feeling of :freshly exfoliated skin"", other than that, no remarkable wrinkle defense experienced. It does have a crisp, clean scent that makes you feel like you just shaved though...at least that's what my husband said."
"Neutrogena Men Age Fighter has been keeping my face fresh, healthy and looking young for years now -- and I ain't young! The earlier you start using it the better. Too late to start using it at age 65+. Start in 30s or 40s."
"The quality of this product is great! However, it is the exact same product as their ""Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream SPF 15"". The ingredients are word for word the exact same thing. Don't buy this product, but do buy their Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream SPF 15. It contains the exact same ingredients. It is the same size and it costs much less."
I would like to see this product become available in a larger size preferably in a pump bottle. I am sure the issue is the sell price it would need to carry but I would certainly be OK with paying more. The 1.7oz is great for travel but I use it every morning and I need a larger size.
"Other face products I have tried, either burn and my face broke out causing discomfort. Age Fighter is soothing and a little will go a long way. Slightly over priced, but when you have the produuct. . . I highly recommed it use and suggest the price be kept where it is for while. Satisfied customer"
I have been using Men® Age Fighter for over six years. It really serves to moisturize my face and keep wrinkles at bay. It also is an excellent sunscreen as I ride motorcycles.
"I use Neutrogena Age Fighter Face Moisturizer for Men with SPF15 after I shave in the morning, keeps my skin moist and protects my face from Florida sun all day with SPF15. I also apply a bit before bed for added moisture at night. Great stuff."
"A wonderful, non-greasy skin cream that keeps the sun at bay. Cloudy days are as bad as sunny ones as far as your face is concerned. This is one precaution not to be overlooked."
"I purchase this for my husband since he been wearing it his skin looks more hydrated,, it's only been a few days so we have yet to see results.. Overall really great product"
"I bought this lotion based on reviews, and it is very strong. It burns my face when I apply it on the morning. I had to stop using because this lotion burned the upper side of my cheek."
Bought for the hubby because he was using mine.
"I use it on my whole face, also as after shave. I'm 58 my wifes 36, I need to look as young as I can."
Can fell and realized the transition in my skin appearance and the possibility of reducing facial lines in the future aging process.
Had been using the expensive brand from the department store and found this to be better and not greasy.
I am a fire captain in Southern California. My job has me outside a lot. This product keeps my skin healthy from the elements and it doesn't run into my eyes when I sweat
I have been using this product now for about 2 months in combination with an Alpha Hydroxy cream. I can really see a big difference in how my skin looks and feels. Great product!
I've been using this product for months and it makes my skin feel great.
"Leaves my skin very soft, no smell, no irritations, excellent product."
I used it everyday after shave and it is really great
"my hubby loves it, keep his face smooth and no greasy"
"Great Product! Best day time face lotion. Not greasy, just perfect."
This cream is excellent. Very small dabs are all that is needed.
"It is impossible to state that a product, used for 1 week, is beneficial. It has no odor, it is absorbed well and does not leave any oily residue, so far it seems to have protected me from the sun. I intend to continue to use it, but I cannot fully recommend it until I have seen some long-term benefit."
"This product helps to moisturize my forehead. I also think it does work on the wrinkles, but being a guy I don't know anything about that. Good Product overall."
