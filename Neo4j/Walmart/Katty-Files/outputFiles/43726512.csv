I love this Olay moisturizer. Very light. Not greasy and makes my skin look and feel great all day. It makes putting on my foundation much easier.
"One of the bottles was available for sampling so I applied a little on the top part of my hand. It turned my dried hand into a smooth one but not greasy. So I purchased one for my face. I have combination skin. Oily in the summer and dry in the winter. I'm in Los Angeles, CA so it's usually hot here year round. This moisturizer is great for my skin."
I absolutely love this product! Feels so light on my skin. Only wish I could find it at more locations-hard to find! Ive been using Olay products for 25+ years and I strongly feel that the products have helped keep my face looking young and healthy. Even after all the time I spent in the sun.
"I have the best luck with every Olay product I've ever used. Their moisturizers are just fabulous. Lightweight and non greasy but they act like a heavyweight as far as performance. Also I love the SPF as I live in Florida where the sun always shines. So I get great age fighting, lightweight, non greasy with a nice spf moisturizer AND my make-up glides right over this! I love it.."
"When in a hurry and knowing I will be in sun, this is the product I grab. No one ever know I have it on and yet I feel beautiful and protected from sun. What a wonderful product from a wonderful company!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this... it is so light and does not feel greasy or oily as many moisturizers do. It doesn't make my face break out either. My little fine lines seem to diminish. I also love the sunscreen it has, as this sunny, hot, dry air I live in can really take it's toll. Olay really outdid themselves with this one! Thanks OLAY [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"LOVE this moisturizer! Not only this moisturizer absorbs my skin fast it also doesn't make my skin oily and I have an oily skin. It goes on smooth and doesn't feel heavy at all. This is my first time using oil of olay and I must say, it didn't disappoint and I'm looking forward to trying other products from oil of olay."

"While I only have good things to say about this moisturizer, I was frustrated by the packaging. It was impossible to get all of the product from the bottle (which is a waste of money). I typically love Olay products and will continue to buy them, however, I will avoid this type of packaging in the future."
I've used olay for 2years know and I enjoy the way it makes my face and neck feels so refreshed smooth and the glowing many complaints on my look of my face so clear and healthy looking .I have recommend to many of my friends and family and even put some on my husband face I told him it was a skin protector lol [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Let olay take care of your skin us women have enough to worry about why haft to worry about out skin when this product does it for us. Buy some today.
"Although this item might cost a few more dollars than most moisturizers, it has a lot of good benefits. Soft skin, smells good, and you can also purchase with a hint of skin foundation for color. I love Olay products and have been using them for years."
"I would like to comment on this moisturizer. It is fantastic, fabulous, awesome and I wont use anything else. This product not only delivers a great moisturizer but a wonderful sunscreen that is fragrance free. Let's face it, as you age, you need all the sunscreen you can get especially for your face. I would highly recommend this product to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just discovered Total Effects Feather Weight Moisturizer recently and I was amazed at the results I have already seen in my skin. I will be 80 years old in September and have used Olay products for many, many years. In the past I could be in a store or bank and a clerk would compliment me on my skin. With Total Effects Feather Weight Moisturizer I can look in the mirror and see wonderful results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using one or more olay products since I was 20. I love them all. The moisturizer with spf 15 is my go to day or night when traveling, its a must have. I can use it day or night. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love the total effects skin care line. I get compliments every week on how great my skin looks and what my secret is. My Grandmother and my mother have used Oil of Olay as do I and my two daughters as well. This product is lightweight and does not feel like I have sunscreen on which is a must have here in Arizona. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this moisturizer. Not only does it have SPF which is suprisingly hard to find in a moisturizer but it feels very light on my skin. It also felt very gentle on my skin which is another big plus since my skin is extremely sensitive and there are so many products that cause my skin to get red and irritated. This I am happy to say did not irritate my skin at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love love love! I have used Olay products for almost 33 yrs. Starting with just regular Olay moisturizer to featherweight moisturizer with the spf-15. I think it helps the aging process from wrinkles to fine lines. Thank you okay for sch great products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I actually had someone tell me today that I look 10 years younger than my 52 years! They said I must have a great skin care program. I said 'Olay'! I've been using Olay product since High School, when it was Oil of Olay and will never change to any other brand. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is truly featherweight. There is no residual heaviness after applying the product and it feels great on my skin. The only complaint I would have is one that I have noticed with a lot of SPF moisturizers: there is a shininess that is unappealing after the product is applied which can last all day. I do not wear make-up so the shininess, which looks like grease, is annoying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As the brand name states, this moisturizer is light weight - ""feather weight"" is how you describe it and it is true. Very light weight and sheer while providing good sunscreen coverage. Don't even know it is on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"THIS IS BY FAR THE BEST MOISTURIZER FOR ME DURING THE HOT AND STICKY SUMMER MONTHS. IT IS NON GREASY, NOT HEAVY AND ABSORBS QUICKLY. I GET SUN PROTECTION AND THE ADDED BENEFITS OF A GREAT PRODUCT FOR NOT A LOT OF COST. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Oil of Olay total effects feather weight moisturizer has everything that I am looking for in a moisturizer. The feather weight lotion goes on smoothly, leaving your skin feeling very soft. I love the fragrance free option is great. I have used Oil of Olay products for over 25 years and this one is perfect for this time in my life. Thank you for continually reliable products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is light yet powerful. I feel great about the moisture provide and the SPF skin care. So easy in one step year round protection for my skin. Most people think my mom is my age and that I am much younger because of how great my skin looks! I'll take that! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the way my skin feels after I apply it to my face and neck area. You don't have to apply a sunscreen with it- It's all-in-one saves time and money. It does not feel oily or heavy on your skin-this is important in the summertime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using Olay products for at least 30 years, and Total Effects SPF 15 for as long as I can remember. I frequently get complements about my complexion, which I owe to the sunscreen in Total Effects. I was thrilled when you introduced SPF 30, my new favorite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love all of the Olay product I've ever used, this one is silky and smooth. Everyone always tells me me I look so young, it feels like you have nothing on I would highly recomend this product to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I always moisturize in the morning after I wash up. Especially in the summer, it is good to know I am using a product to battle the sun. It is lightweight, non greasy and doesn't make my face break out. Great all around product for every day use. I highly recommend Olay's Total Effects products . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great product, but, hard to find. I have been using Olay for over 40years. The original moisturizer is not available but I still use the original eye cream. I loved the ""old"" Olay base makeup, but that is no longer available. The feather weight is close to the original moisturizer (that I used twice a day)that had SPF 15 in it as well...it's a bit more expensive (I use it once a day now). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This Total Effects moisturizer is definitely worth the money! I had not yet tried this product in this particular line from Olay, but it will be the only moisturizer that I will ever use from now on. My Skin soaks this product in, very light and non greasy! Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just completed my second purchase of this item. I could not believe that after my first week of using the Total Effects Feather Weight Moisturizer my skin looked visibly improved. I will be 80 years of age in September. I have used Olay products for many years and If this product has this effect on my skin, it will work wonders on everyone's skin, young and old. I will never be without it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love Oil of Olay and have been using it for 35 years (Mom's advice). However, the Total Effects with moisturizer and sunscreen gives me all I need in one bottle. It does not leave my skin greasy yet never dry. With so many wonderful choices it was difficult to decide. Total Effects is perfect for aging:0) I need it all and it is "" all in one."" Thank you very much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use it on a daily basis, just so light and non greasy. My skin feels like it can breathe and feels fresh . I've iused it in the winter and now as it gets hotter I enjoy using it even more. Even though it's lite my skin is soft n moist . I wish I found this earlier...specially as my moisturizing needs have changed with age. . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is very light on your skin, however is it very effective. I like how soft it makes my skin feel. It has help decrease my wrinkles. I also have notice that my skin tone has evened out. An added bonus is the Sunscreen, however in order for sunscreen to be totally effective, it must be reapplied throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall, I like this product. Almost every product with sunscreen causes me to break out and makes my skin oily. This is very lightweight and I have notice only minimal breakout. It does seem to make my skin a little shinier than I would like, but does not feel greasy or heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Total effects feather weight moisturizer is awesome. I put it on everyday after washing my face and before putting on my make-up. I love its lightweight non greasy feel especially under my make-up so my face doesn't feel weighed down. The SPF is a major benefit also to help protect my skin from future damage. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a lightweight protective moisturizing barrier for their face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am a long time user of this line and have always been very happy with it. When I saw this ""feather light"" version I gave it a shot. Feather Light is no exaggeration. It feels so light and weightless when I smooth it on. Odd to say that my face doesn't feel weighed down. I didn't know what I was missing. Love this new formula!!!"
Love the way my skin feels after I use this. My mother has used Olay for 15+ years and I would always take a pump (or two) from hers in high school. Just wish it came in a jumbo size :)
I took the skin advisor analyst and brought all the products they recommended. I used them for about 3 months with no improvement in my skin analyst and no visible improvement to me. Disappointed to say the least.
I had been using a more expensive moisturizer but as I aged I decided to try Olay. I am very pleased and find my skin more supple and less wrinkled. I like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

OLAY products are truly effective and amazing :) I love you OLAY :)
"I always use play. They're the best. I've used other brands, but always come back to olay."
As with all other Olay products this is exactly what it says.
