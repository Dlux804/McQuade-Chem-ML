This is an amazing product! I noticed a difference the very first time I used it. It says on the box that there is a warming sensation but for me it was hardly anything at all. Maybe that depends on your skins condition? I feel so good after I use this its like a deep clean for your face and you can use it twice a week if you like. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone!!!!!
"This Microdermabrasion & Peel Treatment works really nicely, it is gently enough to use a couple a times a week. I use it in the shower, lot easier that way. Use in combination with daily use of Olay Regenerist Daily facial cream and the Night cream."
"I have really dry skin, so finding something that exfoliates, but doesn't leave my skin sore is always an issue. I have used this product in the past, and recently purchased another round. Applying the first step was a little scary the first time because it is really sharp. Once you apply the gel over the crystals it feels great. It is something I will definitely buy again."
"I am an Olay Regenerist fan, but this is the first time to purchase this kit. First use resulted in smoother skin with no irritation. Dermabrasion is probably the surest way to clearer skin, especially to diminish age spots."
I love how clean my face feels after using. I use this product 2 -3 times a week in the shower. It is acidic so build up your tolerance level. It is messy to use and the sugar granuals are difficult to wash away which is why I use this in the shower and then I wash my hair. Any way you decide to use it use caution if your nails are polished as the glycolic liquid will damage your manicure. I sometimes use latex gloves or do a mani after using this product.

"This product is amazing !! I have tried other brands because I have recently had a hard time finding it, please don't stop making this !! My skin looks amazing after using it."
"I recently returned to this product after trying several other scrubs. Better than most OTC and home use scrubs. The only product that actually makes a noticeable difference. I am fair-skinned, freckle and sunburn easily, have reddish hair but this product is still gentle enough on my skin. Do not be alarmed if your face turns red after the first use, this is temporary. Best when used in the shower, easier to remove the crystals but turn down the heat a bit or your face will turn really red."
Just used this tonight my face feels soft and squeaky clean could have sworn that very deep vertical frown line isn't as prominent but i may be wishful thinking looking forward to seeing more results.
"This is my second purchase for this product and now I can't live without it! I have really sensitive skin, but I've never had any bad reactions. I love the smell of the product too. I have used other microdermabrasion kits, but they don't compare to this one. My skin feels so soft and clean. When I haven't used it for a week, my skin doesn't feel as smooth or look as youthful and vibrant. I absolutely love this stuff!"
"Hands down, the best at home micro dermabrasion kit. It's affordable and very effective! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Really like this Peel system, it is really the same as the other HIGH dollar product that is out there in the market, i have used the other one and did not see any difference in the two, the orange sent is the same the warming feeling the same, the result the same, really do like this product."
I use it at night followed by my olay night cream as it does cause some redness but the next AM my skin is brighter and smoother. Love this product! I am a MK convert..I switched to Olay because I could buy it in a store at a fraction of the cost. I was experiencing fine lines and breakouts in my 30s but since switching to Olay my 40s are breakout free and my complexion has never looked better!
"I am acne-prone, so I was looking for a product to help keep my skin clear and healthy. Have been using this product for several months (this was my second order) and have no complaints. It is a little tingly and gives a slight burning sensation sometimes, but I never came away with a red face. My skin definitely feels and looks better after using it. I follow up with the regenerist serum or night cream (depending on when I use it, day or night)."
I always use this it is s great product! I always run out of the Liguid activator and have too much of the other left over ... I thought about putting it on my feet and just rinsing it with water just to use it up...
"I've been using this product on and off for several years. It dies a good job of ""resurfacing"" my skin when used as directed. It is a little messy, but it is not unpleasant. I require a good moisturizer when I'm finished."
"I have been using this treatment for years & years! It's my go to when my skin is looking dull or when i feel like my pores are blocked. (Prone to blackheads) After use my skin always looks refreshed, feels smooth & my pores are clear. Just like when i leave my esthetician's. Definitely an amazing exfoliate."
Skin is baby soft after the first use. After the first week visibly diminished fine wrinkles. I use it 3X wk. I'm 52 and this product makes me feel ok about that!
"My skin feels incredible. I keep touching it and being amazed at how smooth I feel. The scrub is more abrasive than I thought it would be, but I was prepared for that considering it is called 'crystals'. Totally worth the initial mild discomfort. I will be using this every time I feel like have baby soft skin."
A Great Product! It reduces outbreakes and gives me an overall appearance of healthy looking skin-I love the way this makes my skin glow. Well worth the money. *I also bought the Zeno Hot Spot for those pesky breakouts-the two products together are AWESOME!!
"I have only used this product 2 times now and have noticed my crows feet are greatly reduced. I am guessing by the 4th treatment they will be totally gone! This stuff is incredible! Not to mention it makes your face soft like a new baby, feeling very clean and refreshed. A little goes a LONG way! One box using twice a week as recommended should last me 3-4 months. Well worth the $"
"I purchased this set by mistake; I was trying to get some type of dark spots treatment. I was not planning to use it; however, I gave it a try. I noticed my face was smoother the first time I used it. I thought it was an coincident, but this happened every time i used it. So I started to like this set. I am a loyal Mary Kay Timewise Miracle set user. Now I am thinking of using this set to replace Mary Kay microdermabrasion set."
"I've always used microdermabrasion, and used Loreal's until they discontinued it. I had never tried a peel before, though. This is the way you want to start if you have never tried one before. It's not a deep peel, but you do feel the warmth and tingle to let you know it's working. I have sensitive skin and this doesn't cause me any problems, and my skin feels and looks so much smoother."
Amazing product. Really does bring that beautiful glowing skin to the surface !! SOOO worth the $!! And Wal-Mart.com has the lowest price! ($24 at Target and $26 at Ulta). So if you are going to give it a chance (PLEASE DO!) I would suggest buy it from Wal-Mart.com ! :)
"This product exfoliates like no other I have tried. I have oily, acne prone skin and after using this for a while, my skin cleared up considerably. This also helped with the appearance of old scars. I am in love and would reccommend this product to any of my friends."
"Started using 1 month ago, twice weekly, has really lightened or erased brown spots on forehead, skin clearer, pores minimized greatly, less clogging, was skeptical at first, but wholly convinced and my skin looks much finer, age 60. No difficulty with redness. Marketing campaign a success!!"
"I love Olay products, especially the Regenerist and Definity lines. This product is amazing. I could see a difference immediately. My skin felt great, so smooth and my one age spot diminished. Once again Olay has proven you do not have to pay $100's of dollars for quality skin care products."
"I am dealing with both acne AND aging skin (gee, thanks, nature), so I always look for treatments that can smooth and exfoliate in a way that helps both of my skin concerns. I really liked how this warmed as it was applied, and the exfoliant was very fine in grit. My face was not red after use, but felt INCREDIBLY smooth. No difference in pore appearance on my cheeks, but on my nose everything looked squeaky clean and completely clear. I will keep using for sure!"
"I use the regenerist serum and whip moisturizer...but the real star is this microdermabrasion treatment. I have always had troubled skin and yesterday someone actually said, ""Your skin is beautiful"". This is a miracle...fast and easy to use just twice a week does the trick. Instant results on the feel of my skin, but since I have used this for a little more than a month my pores are clear, dry patches gone, other products absorb better and I can use way less concealer and foundation...I can actually go make-up free."
"It is costly,has little effect on skin,and no noticeable change occured."
Do not wish to use Jet again !!! Item opened and used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product does smooth the skin and gives you immediate results. However, I haven't noticed lasting results even using three times per week. But if you like pampering yourself, this is very nice. Feels like a mini microderm."
I was very disapointed with this product. Before I bought it I read the reviews so I had expected so much more. My skin didn't feel any softer or different what so ever and I therefore would not recommend it.
"I was afraid that I would not be able to use this product, since I have sensitive skin. But, this product is mild enough and still brings results. I can't remember the last time my skin was this soft, from the first use."
"Without a doubt my favorite drugstore product. Worth every penny. However, it can make your face a little red. So plan accordingly if you're not planning on wearing makeup."
"Very easy to apply, no bad smell and very little of the warming effect. It did not leave my face as soft as I had expected. Maybe after the next application."
"I first began using this produce because I was having issues with dry, flaky skin and nothing that I used seemed to help. This product is amazing. I no longer struggle with dry, patchy, flaky, dull skin. Instead I have soft looking glowing skin (for my age). I am 66 years old and constantly am told that I look much younger. I love, love this product. Please, please never discontinue it!"
Works well skin was fresh and smooth After
Have been using for awhile and like the results.
This product works Wonderful!!!! I Love the way my face feels after using it !!
My skin does feel smooth and soft.
"I BOUGHT THE MICRODERMABRASION KIT FROM WALMART. THE FIRST 2 TIMES I USED IT I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BE GREAT FOR MY FACE. THE 3RD TIME I USED IT MY CHEECKS, CHIN, AND NOSE TURNED REALLY RED AND WAS IRRITATED FOR 2 DAYS. IF YOU HAVE SENSITIVE SKIN, I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT."
"I don't use this product as often as directed. When I do, there is a noticable change in my skin texture with just one use. My husband noticed it immediately. If it is that noticable with sporadic use I can just imagine what it would be like if I used it as directed."
"I am an esthetician and must say this product is one of the best purchases you could ever make. It could not work better. It has helped soften pit scars i had from acne, which i thought would never happen without professional treatment. It seems very similar to a product i purchased from sephora before, except at one third of the cost. Fantastic!"
I have had this facial many times at fancy Dr.'s offices and find this product to be very similar to the high end treatment. It smoothes and actually heats up under your fingertips as you apply. Very similar to the expensive papaya enzyme peel offered by famous spas! love this product and product line.
"At first I was skeptical about the results an over-the-counter product could achieve, but I was delightfully surprised. The two-step system was incredibly easy to use and left my skin feeling ultra-smooth. It gently removed the surface flakiness and brightened my dull complexion. I love the fact that I can use it weekly without feeling that it's too harsh for my skin. I've used similar department store products that are much pricier and this is by far the best value on the market."
works great! I've been using it for several years now and will keep buying it as longs as they keep making it.
I've been using this product for years and was heartbroken when I couldn't find it at the store. Glad I can still order it.
"I use this twice a week with the regenerist day cream and night micro sculpting cream and wow, what a difference in my skin..."
I've used olay products since my teens and I love the fact that I don't look close to my age because of continued use. I use this product weekly to keep wrinkles at bay.
"Here's a secret: This product is a lifesaver for Black skin! Not only does it exfoliate your skin, but it also evens your skin tone dramatically!This product is as effective as an actual professional microdermabrasion procedure!"
Keeps my skin smooth.
The microdermabasion & peel product is a fabulous at-home peel. After using it the first time my face felt noticeably softer & cleaner. I have used it once/week since Jan & love how it makes my face feel. After the peel I follow it up with Regenerist Deep Hyration Cream for an even better feel. Just went out & purchased two more of this product.
I use the Regenerist line of products for daily care but this product is by far the most dramatically de-aging product I have ever used. It takes years off my face every time I use it. I have only started using it but I can't wait to see what I look like months from now. I will never be without it. My skin has never been smoother.
"I got this as a Christmas present from my husband ( I had asked for Olay stuff) and if I could I would give it 10 stars!!! The microbeads are really that, micro, and it smells good, peachy! Once you put the activator serum on it becomes nice and warm, but NOT HOT!!! After I washed it, off my forehead felt so smooth I kept telling my husband to touch it, no joke!!! My newest addiction!!!!!!!"
"I had two very bad inside pimples that would not reach the surface, After using this the first time I noticed them going away. I also noticed my face was left clean and smooth, I would recommend this product to anyone. My boyfriend noticed how clear my face looked. Thanks oil of olay. Your the Best!"
"This product has exceeded my expectations. I have been using it twice a week for four weeks and my skin is glowing, soft and feels new. I will never go back to the doctors office as this feels better than when I did. I will continue to purchase this product and recommend it to everyone!"
"This product is awesome! I used it 2-3 times per wk, but stopped for a while b/c I started using Clinique acne products. After I had sporadic breakouts and started investigating microderm and peel procedures, I remembered how well Olay's microderm and peel kit worked, so I started using it again. It makes my skin glow and I haven't seen any pimples since I started using it again!"
"I love this product! I am in my twenties and have always had good and clear skin, but when I left my teen years my skin suddenly broke out and I didn't understand why. I tried everything to clear up my skin, but to no avail. I figured I didn't have anything to loose by trying this product. Within two times of using this product my breakouts stopped, and my acne scarring began to clear up. I will continue using this product."
I was really surprised at how effective this product is. After my first use I could see and feel a difference in the texture of my skin. My pores seemed so much smaller and my skin was so smooth I couldn't stop touching it. It's really easy to use and has a pleasant orange-citrus smell. I highly recommend this product for anyone interested in at-home microdermabrasion.
I have been using this product for a month now and my skin has never felt better! I use it twice a week and look forward to my Sunday's and Thursday's like never before! I have been getting acne where I usually don't however I know that this product is working to uncover clogged pores and is cleaning my skin out! I also use it on my neck and the lines on my neck look and feel SO much better!
"I have used this product twice weekly as directed. My friends and family have noticed marked improvement in my skin texture, and I have felt the results in softer, smoother skin as well. I have moderate sun damage and this product seems to help lighten the spots and roughness. A wonderful bargain and easy to procure."
"I just purchased this kit as a little reward for myself! I just quit smoking and thought what better way to heal the inside and the outside of my body! I tore open the box when i got home from the store,and quickly read the directions.Super clear and easy to use,this product has already made my skin feel better. I have systic(spelling?) acne on my chin and some acne scarring. I am really hopeful that this mirco will continue to work! It feels excellent right now!"
I love this product - it is absolutely one of my favorites! I find it is very similar to the Philosophy Microdelivery Peel which is $65! I seem to get the same results with this for much less money - but if I use it too frequently my skin does get irritated. So make sure to follow the directions.
"Yes as we age, our skin type changes and I developed brown aging spots. Inherited from my mother, I decided to treat these spots immediately. The microdermabrasion & peel system removed a dime size brown spot from my cheek. Then a friend talked me into using a more expensive ""party sale"" product. I have new age spots now, this new product does not treat age spots at all even though it claims to. Thank you Olay for this microdermabrasion ""home"" treatment!"
The activation fluid lasts twice as long as the microdermabrasion scrub.
I was weary as to whether it would work on my skin or not and I can sincerely say that this product exceeded my expectations. Race: African-African
"I just did my first treatment, and IT IS AMAZING how wonderful my skin feels. My husband couldn't stop touching my face it felt so soft. Well done."
This is a really great product. My face was so smooth after the first use. My face was a little reddened but it is worth it. The next day (after a nights sleep) my face was back to normal with less blackheads!!!
"This product is a fast way to get smoother skin, but the effect doesn't seem to last long. I miss the L'Oreal microdermabrasion kit (which was discontinued). It worked much better."
"I have used and loved the Age Defying Series for about 14 years. I started using this product about once or twice per week in addition. I love this product! It makes my skin smoother, softer, and more glowing and exfoliated!"
"This is the best product on the market to achieve a smooth, regenerated complexion. Please continue to make it. I use it 2-3 times per week and have received so many compliments on my skin for the first time in my 50 plus years."
"The first time I tried this product, my pores definitely looked smaller and my skin had a glow that I have not been able to achieve with other products"
"I am almost 68 years old and have been using this product since it was first introduced. People are constantly amazed by and comment on my skin. I have recommended this product to hundreds of women. I usually purchase two kits at a time. Recently, it has not been easy to find in the Olay section of various merchants. Please DO NOT discontinue this product. I declare, I will buy up every last bit of product if this were to go away. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT."
I have tried this product before and I really like it. The issue this time was that the box appeared to have already been opened. The seal at the top of the box was loose and the bottles inside pulled away from the adhesive and apparently put back in sideways. I am concerned about using it so I am going to return it.
I love this product. I like the microdermabrasion. It really scrubs the skin and I feel it must be doing what it is supposed to. The peal activator leaves my skin shining. I do not see any difference with my fine lines and wrinkles though. So I am disappointed with that aspect of this product.
I was a little concerned about buying this because I'm on a low income but I decided to pamper myself. It was worth it! It helped with the brown skin spots on my face and made my face so clean and smooth. I loved it! It would have lasted a long time but my daughter and niece's wanted to try it and loved it to! I will be getting more soon. Thank you Olay!
"I love this product, but, I wish it would mention to use a SPF moisturizer when going out because I'm in PA and it feels like it's 113 out and my face felt like it was on fire after using the microdermabrasion/peel kit. I'm not going to stop using this, but I wish it was labeled a little better. All in all my skin feels fabulous"
I have used Olay moisturizer spf15 since I was a young teen. I now if my 3 preterm/teen daughters - use them. Well I just turned 50 and I have had 3 dermatologists tell me that my skin looks great!! But age obviously sets in and I started to notice fine lines on forehead ... Skin not as smooth as it should be....naturally I checked the Olay product line and decided to try the 2 step microdermabrasion kit. I saw visible results after 1 use!!!! It's an amazing product. Love it!!! It works!!!!
"This is my favorite Olay product. I use it at least twice a week. It leaves my skin smooth, with a poreless look. No other product achieve these results in any line of skin care. Microdermabrasion by Olay is superb. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As a man, I thought this would help my rough skin and fight aging. Wow! was I so right! Use once a week and really has improved texture and really look forward to even better results with continued use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Olay regenerist products for a while now and I loved it so much I now have almost the entire collection of Olay products! I love it. It has done wonders for my face, especially the eye roller [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for a while and I am amaze at how effective it is. I have younger softer skin and my pores and blackhead have diminished. I will continue to use this product for many years [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product. It does what ti claims. I use ti on days i want to look and feel especially good. It makes my skin look and feel smooth! I have used it for over 2 years and I tell everyone about it. It is like liquid sand paper, but it doesn't leave me red or burned. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My mom used Olay for years.And was happy with it.The new generation of products are better than ever and not very expensive. They do a great job of keeping my skin looking youthful and soft to the touch [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I get this on subscription from Amazon so I get a fresh package every month. I use this two to three times a week, in the shower, which might make it a little less effective than the recommended use, but in the shower I can use it on my neck and chest, too. My pores have never looked cleaner or smaller, and my skin always looks soft and fresh."
I am 34 years old and am just now noticing brown spots and damage to my skin from years in the sun. I was desperate to find something that would help bring my young looking skin back. I found it. I've only used it once and I can already see a difference. I love it! Thank you Olay!
"This is a must have product, I remeber the first time is used it my skin felt so soft and smooth. I was in my car bored at a stop light and flipped down my mirror. I couldn't believe how my skin looked. Takes years off and if it's been a week or so since you last used it you will notice. Unfortunatley this product is addicting and you will find yourself running to the store for more! I call this my beauty secret. Can't wait to see how the regenerist microsculpting cream works along with this!"
"I am 32 and recently had my first child. Of course, everything changes after a baby so I bought this to pamper myself and help even out all of the sun damage I have. I used it for the first time last night and I can already tell a big difference!! My skin tone is more even and my face is soft as can be!! If you're on the fence, BUY IT!!! I will continue to use for many years to come!!"
"The first time I used this product I was really worried, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. My skin turned slightly pink, but I used lots of moisturizer and it went away quickly. The second time I used it i didn't scrub as hard and there wasn't any pinkness. I even have to admit I used this product on my feet and I had amazing results. Nothing but smooth feet after that. It's definately worth trying and I will buy it again."
"After looking for a product to give my face a more polished look I ran across reviews on this. This is a very gentle but effective system with great results. I have been using this for 2 weeks now and my skin is brighter, smoother and definitely reduced pore size. I love this and will continue to incorporarate this twice a week. LOVE IT!"
"I have oily combination skin that often breaks out when surface dryness blocks pores. After using this product, not only do my pimples clear up overnight but my whole face looks brighter and smoother. The before/after is very noticeable, so I usually use it right before the weekend or before special social events. I also apply Regenerist Serum after using the Microdermabrasion and Peel."
"You will notice a difference the very first time you use this product. Smells good, feels good, and is gentle. My skin looks the best it has in a long time. Very satisfied with this system."
"I have use this system for the last 6 years, people ask me what I'm doing to keep my skin so nice and clean every time I use this product. I definitely recommended every time someone ask me what I use. THANK YOU OIL OF OLAY!"
I absolutely love this product! I previously used a Philosophy brand kit and this is very comparable. It is much more affordable and makes my skin so soft. It also makes my skin glow! I don't want to be without it!
Olay products have always been great! I used Olay products since I was a teenage girl. You can never go wrong using Olay Products for your face. I am 60 years of age and people think I am in my 40s.
This product is so hydrating and great the sun is not too bad it's bearable I'm not really OK with sense but it's bearable for me I have sensitive skin and I'm not really aging but I like to use it just in case #contest
I love all of my Olay products. My face always feels cleaned and looks refreshed. People never believe my age and I have Olay to thank for that [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The cleansing process seems a little complicated at first but once you get the routine down, it's no problem. Leaves your skin feeling so soft and clean, you're tempted to use it every single day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm 51. Although I've aged well, sometimes my skin needs help. This is a great product for middle age women. I'm so proud of my skin. Oil of olay helps. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
this product has really changed my skin tone and helped the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles be less noticeable and sun spots have diminished!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I totally love this product! I have acne prone skin and this product even makes my skin look good. I will always use this product and I would highly recommend it to anyone!
"I have used the Microdermabrasion Peel System and immediately noticed a difference in my skin texture...smoother. I wish the bottle of SERUM was LARGER. It's almosts empty and I have a lot of ""scrub"" remaining."
This Regenerist product is the best! I started using it a couple of years ago and I love how my skin looks and feels after using it! I've been using Oil of Olay products exclusively for 35 years and there is nothing better in my opinion!
"I use this at least once a week. It makes my skin feel so smooth. Even my husband notices the difference. I have recommended to friends, and they love it also. Thank you Olay!"
"I have bought this product twice. And I must say, I love the results!!!"
This product works the first time you use it and every time there after. I would recommend it to anyone who wants younger looking skin
This product does wonders for my skin. I am having a difficult time finding it on the shelves. Please don't discontinue this favorite product.
I seriously love this product but wish they would sell step 1 separately I tend to use half of the serum in the time I use the whole step 1
This treatment is exceptional!! Skin glows & feels & looks great afterwards!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just started using Olay Regenerist and i am absolutely in love with it all!
I feel like I'm getting a deep clean that leaves my skin smooth.
You'll feel the great result soon after you use this.
Thankful to be able to find this product at a good price and to have it delivered!
