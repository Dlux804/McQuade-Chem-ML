4.5,"['269', '30', '8', '7', '26']"
I've used this serum for 7 years now and I believe it's the reason I don't look my age. I'm 52
"Love All Olay Products,but Regegerist just smoothies and firms face to the (T)!!"
I've been using Olay products for many years and they are the best!! The Regenerist serum leaves my skin soft and supple. It seems to have a glow after applying. I love this stuff. I'd never spend hundreds of dollars for department store brands as long as I have Olay.
"I use the serum, microderm abrasion/peel and night cream products and love them all. I'm acne prone, and these products have helped my skin. I use the serum daily."
"I bought this because it is rated five stars by Paula's Choice. An excellent serum packed with antioxidants, its silicone serves as a primer, too. This has fragrance, but is made in a fragrance-free version."
I have been using this stuff as face moisturizer after I shower or wash my face for the past 5 years (20 to 25). It is light and makes my skin feel so soft (not oily like other moisturizers). It is expensive but one bottle usually lasts me 6 months so I think it's worth the splurge. I highly recommend it for those who want a light but effective moisturizer. I don't know how to explain it other than my skin looks pretty with that stuff on (no makeup). It's weird but it is a real 'miracle cream' to me.
Love this so much I use it on my hands as well. If I could afford to; I would use it as a body lotion.
"I have been using this for years. I have very sensitive skin and it is the only product that I don't have issues with and I've tried numerous products over the years. Well worth the price, a little goes a long way and no greasy feeling. I also have spots of eczema and this product pretty much keeps it under control if I use it daily. Other products have only enflamed the condition. I am 58 and have almost no wrinkles, people comment on it all the time. Olay has something to do with that."
I love this serum! I use it twice a day. I'm 55 and it is amazing
Great product - bad packaging. The pump container only pumps about 3/4 of the product out.....leaving the consumer to struggle to get as much of the lotion out as possible.
"Have been using the Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum for about two weeks. However, I haven't noticed any changes in my particular hyperpigmentation skin condition. Will continue using the product to completion in the hope that it will clear up my skin condition."
I love this product!! It makes such a difference on my face. I went to buy it and no one carrys it anymore. I bought the new one in the red container and it seems greasier and a completely different consistancy. Why do they change things if they work??
I have seen great results by using this product. I use the serum for day wear and it works great under makeup. highly recommend.
I love this this Olay. I've used it for years. It really does make your skin smooth and helps keep the wrinkles down. It also makes your makeup go on a lot smoother! There is just nothing that I don't like about it! Everyone should give it a try!
"Love this serum. I used to use A Perfect World by Origins, but find this to be just as good. Smoothes my skin and keeps it young looking. People ask me often what I use on my face, as I am 70 years old and have hardly a wrinkle!"
I used this product many times before and it makes my face care so easy and refreshing. I didn't know I could save so much buying it online. Thanks Walmart.
Just recently purchased but already love it! not greasy but feels amazingly on. Leaves skin soft and supple in just a short time you will notice benefits. Highly recommend!!
This works well. It is not heavy and soaks in quickly. it moisturizes well and affects the skin fast. Within a few days of starting to use it other people noticed and some commented that I looked younger.
"Seeing that the second ingredient in this product is Dimeth-icone (silicone). This product is exactly the same as every primer you'll find. Silicone fills in lines, wrinkles & pores (predominantly for an even makeup application) but it doesn't regenerate your skin. Silicone based is also notorious for clogging pores & causing reactions to people with sensitive skin. If I would have known this wasn't a moisturizer I would have stuck with the 100's or primers I have."
"I use the fragrance free serum for ( allergy reasons), and I use it everyday with or without make up. I love the soft silky feel it gives my (dry) skin. I apply it over clean skin before I apply my make up, and the make up goes on so smooth and feel fresh and soft. My dryness is releived and noticable little lines disappear. I love this product and highly recommend it to use everyday, for a noticable differance."
"I started using this produce by way of a sample. I truly love it. I have been using it for a few years now. Tried different products, but finally realized I was wasting my money. I only use Olay Regenerist fragrance free Serum now. At 48 years of age...it feels good to be viewed as someone over 10 years younger. People ask me all the time what do I do to my skin...Olay Regenerist. Hooked for life."
"I always buy a replacement of Regenerist Serum before I even run out. I don't want to be without it. I see a marked difference in the texture of my skin since I have been using this product, which has been for several years since it came out. I'd recommend it to anyone to use, man or woman. It's not greasy, it's a light gel and will retexture your skin. It makes your skin smooth and reduces the look of your pores. I really, truly love it."
"i HAVE BEEN USING THIS OLAY PRODUCT FOR 5 YEARS. MY GRANDMOM SAID ""TAKE CARE OF YOUR FACE"". OLAY REGENERIST IS THE ABSOLUTE ANSWER. I USE IT ONCE DAILY, DOES NOT REQUIRE A HUGE AMOUNT TO COVER YOUR FACE AND THE RESULTS ARE AWESOME. SMALL LINES AROUND MOUTH AND EYES HAVE DISAPPEARED, KEEPS MY FACE SOFT AND HYDRATED. I RECEIVE MANY COMPLIMENTS ON NOT LOOKING MY AGE."
"To think I found what works for me at Walmart.....Go figure..... I'm 63 with great skin {genetics and chemical peels} I tried this as a whim and I am overly impressed. It will smooth out fine lines, keeps new ones from forming, shrinks pores, and moisturizes at the same time. I've used this line of products for almost a year, and I'm not changing. I use the entire line of Regenerist products. Give it a try nothing to lose except wrinkles!!"
"I agree with the person who said there is so much more in the bottle but since you can't open the lid, you have to cut it in half. I have never tried that but i know there is a lot wasted. Olay should make the cap so you can remove it. It's so wasteful not being able to get it all out especially b/c it's so expensive!"
"This product is non-greasy, light and makes my skin feel wonderfully smooth. The serum is so easily absorbed, I can apply makeup right away. And I love the scent (PLEASE DON'T CHANGE IT!). Just smelling it as I am applying the serum makes me feel good."
"I searched and searched for a daily mosturizer for a long time until my mother in law told me she had always used OLAY products I decided to try it out. I have dry sesitive skin and most creams were just too heavy. It was like putting on the cream and it went no were. With Olay Regenerating Serum my face gets in instant glow, and the soft light velvety serum - my skin type loves it, it just soaks it up. It really keeps my skin looking its best don't know what I'd do without it. THANKS OLAY!"
I have used this for quite some time. Walmart had the best price!
"I love the silky sleek feel of this product. It is lightweight, non-greasy and works well with make-up."
The Olay serum has keep my skin younger for 20 years. Well worth the price. I sue it under other lotion.
I use this product daily. It leaves my skin with a soft and dewy look and feel and also feeling protected.
I love using this product but it is too expensive to buy in store... I was thrilled to find it on here!
"Seeing that the second ingredient in this product is Dimeth-icone (silicone). This product seems/feels exactly like very primer I use. Is that what the product is, & just renamed as a ‘serum' ?"
I've been using Estee lauder's Idealist for years at $50 an ounce but just tried the olay regenerist daily serum & found it to be just as good for less than 1/2 the price.
"I have extremely sensitive skin and the majority of moisturizers break me out, but not this one. It goes on smooth, feels great and smells heavenly. I highly recommend the Regenerist line. You won't regret it!"
"PERFECT. I LOVE THIS SERUM. I USE IT DAILY (AND NIGHTLY). GOES ON EASY, HAS A VERY LIGHT FRAG, CAN BE WORN WITH OR WITHOUT MAKEUP. I'M ALMOST 70, AND HIGHLY RECOMMEND. NOTICED A DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN IN JUST A COUPLE OF WEEKS."
"The Olay Regenerist product line is wonderful. I have been using it for over a year and my skin is much better, smoother and the lines haven't developed any more."
"The original Regenerist serum was outstanding — truly. It was not only my favorite skincare product to date, it was affordable. Why change a product that so many purchased and loved? Please — go back to the original formula. Raise the price by a couple $ if need be, but offer a coupon for purchase through your site for the first purchase. Listen to your past customers and you will see results!"
it has really helped the dryness and itching on my forehead
Have been using for 3 months it has not improved my lines ! I used A.M. and PM
This product does not work for me. It burns a little and turns my face red. I wasted my money.
This is a nice serum-absorbs quickly and results are great.
Excellent product! Works great for removing wrinkles! I use this every day!!
Loved it! I will b reordering this product
"Over the years I have used many different moisturizers, etc. but this is my life saver.I also use some of the other Olay products but none surpasses the regenerating serum Now that I am retired I only wear Olay, no makeup at all. Your face feels & looks ""silky"" I do wish more stores carried the 3 ounce size. I have to go to Sam's Club to get the larger size. It lasts almost a year."
This is a great product and great line! I started with this serum and the night recovery cream. Wow! What a huge difference it made. It smoothed out the fine lines and completely evened out my skin tone (no more red blotchy areas!!). It dramatically changed my skin. I have added other products from this line into my skin routine. I rarely wear make-up now! Would love to see a tinted moisturizer. I currently put on Regenerist then a tinted moisturizer. Great job Olay!
"I found out that I got this skin discoloration after having my son. I was not about to try expensive stuff. I was doing research and found out this product would work. For $19.95 compared to $60 what the heck. Oh my gosh! within a couple of weeks my skin cleared up. ""I even took picutures to prove to myself"" I am almost 40 and look like I am in my 20's. I just love everything about olay."
"I have been using olay regenerist for 2 months now because I had very dry skin and after 2 months of use, I can see a big difference in my skin. I really like this product. My skin feel moist and more hydrated now and I don't have the dry flaking look to my face. The texture of my skin is smoother. The tiny lines has disappeared and I feel more confident with my appearance. This is a keeper. I would recommend this product for all skin types."
"I love this product, I have been using it since it was put on the market. I have always loved the Olay moisturizer, but now I am older and needed something that took care of my older skin. I love the way it keeps my skin soft and reduces the wrinkles. I use it all over my face every morning. I am 56 and people don't think I am that old I give the credit to Olay Regenerist Serum. I recommend to all my friends."
I love this product! I use it before I put on my makeup in the mornings. I have also found it to be really great at reducing/eliminating pimples. I just put a little dab on a pimple before bed and by morning it is almost gone! If only this product cost under $10...but it is still way less expensive than high-end creams that don't work as well!
"I have used this product for many years. This is a ""new and improved"" formula but I think it works just fine."
"I have dry, sensitive skin and use this on some days without putting on a moisturizer afterwards.. it's great"
This product is amazing!! And I'm very picky on things I absolutely love it I seen results after one use! My skin was dry in some spots and it helped wth it. It also smells amazing as well
"I use this daily as a moisturizer after showering. It has a silky smooth feel and it doesn't make your skin feel greasy. I don't know if it does anything for lines and wrinkles, but I like it as a daily moisturizer."
This product is great. It works like a primer under my foundation minimizing my pores and finelines. I reccommend trying it in the morning before your moisturizer and foundation.
It works great.
"the texture of this serum is very similar to a primer. i like that they offer a fragrance free version as my skin turns red with fragrance products. i use this serum to seal in my moisturizer. it has a nice matte/natural finish, the consistency isnt like a typical serum so i find it easier to use after creme/spf rather than before. it does smooth the skin.. but so does a primer. i will not purchase this again, although for less than $20 its a good value :)"
"ok, so i bought this, being skeptical first. i was shocked at what it did to my skin. i will be 30 next year, and after 2 children, my skin changed. and not for the better.i had used some Olay several years ago, but took a break. i did some research on other products, and my mom loves Olay, her skin is stunning at 52, so i decided to give it a try. iv been using it for about 3 weeks now, and iv seen an amazing difference. why did i not think to use this months and months ago???"
These people know skin!I tried to leave oil of olay!Came running back quick!I am 38 and people tell me I look 16!My skin is baby but smooth I also use vitamin E on my skin along with it!Magic!I am African American it works no matter what color you are!
"After several hours of comparision shopping with Department store brands, I opted for the Regenerist line to combat my adult acne, oily skin, and crows feet. This was three weeks ago and I can see a remarkable improvement in the look and feel of my skin. The acne is clearing up, the crow lines are not as noticeable, and I'm wearing less foundation and finally regaining that same healthy, put together look I had three years years ago when I was spending $300 on skincare - at a fraction of the cost."
"I have tried every product under the sun only to have them not work or either break my face out. That is until I started using the Regenerist Regenerating Serum. Now, I will never use anything else. I try not to ever run out because in the past when I did, I could tell by the way my face felt and looked. I am 49 years old and most people think that I am 38 to 40 because of my skin. Thanks for making such a GREAT product!!!!"
I have been using Olay Regenerist products since they were introduced. From the first time I tried Daily Regenerating Serum I have been completely satisfied with all aspects of the product. Most of the time I have not felt the need to use any other moisturizer on top of it because it feels so good. When I first used the serum I felt that my fine lines and skin texture did improve. During the day I often use an Olay product containing sunscreen but the serum is my constant daily/nightly standby.
I have been using Oil of Olay since I was a teenager and still use the products. Now that I am a Senior I have switched to the Regenerist line and it is doing wonders in delaying my aging facial process. My dermatologist told me my face has very little aging. Thanks Oil of Olay.
I have used Olay products for years. The Serum is best for your face in our mountain environment.
good prouct. Brings back the freshness
"I definitely never changed this product, perfect to start a busy and long work day, Im very happy with the results."
This product is amazing!!! I have been using it for over 2 years and I am totally addicted to this. It is part of my morning and nigt time routine and I can not live without it.
"I just started using this product about 2 weeks ago, but my skin felt different immediately!!!!!!! Nice and smooth, well hydrated but not greasy. And I can use it under my normal moisturizer and night cream!"
I am still not sure if this reduces wrinkles or not but I love using it. It makes my skin feel nice and soft. It does not irritate my acne at all and it feels nice under makeup. I really love it.
"I love the feel of this serum. It glides on smoothly and feels very rich. I, too, wish it came in a larger size, say like barrel size. I would bathe in it."
"I've used this serum for years and I still love it and prefer it over all others. Of course I have tried a lot of others, but I've always came back to Olay. This serum gets along well with most foundations and moisturizers. Making them glide on more smoothly and evenly. Other serums cake or roll."
"As a long-time, and very happy user of the original, why would Olay change a great thing? Both daughters, myself, and now preteen and teen granddaughter's, obviously with age/skin type differences, used this product under our primer or base for many years. The teen's are unhappy with the change as well. These gals are your future! It was perfection in a bottle. Our skin looked and felt like silk. Please, change back to the original formula without sunscreen."
"Well, since I am running out of the serum I was looking to purchase a bottle but seeing that the product has changed and the reviews are so poor, I will move on to something else. Sorry Olay, you lost a long time customer. I have not tried this new product so disregard my ratings. It is now too expensive to just take a chance."
"I used this product for about a week on my laugh lines, then on one particular day I woke up with 2 very dark marks where my laugh lines are. I am prone to hyper pigmentation so something in the formula must have not reacted well for me. NOTE: IF YOU ARE DARK SKIN OR PRONE TO HYPERPIGMENTATION, DO NOT USE."
"I'm 59. I started using a serum last year and chose Regenerist based on positive reviews. I was always one who had to plan on a complete makeup redo if I had plans after work as my makeup would never stay fresh. This has made a real difference. My skin looks better, my makeup lasts much longer and I use LESS makeup as I don't have to wash it off and start over. There have never been any side effects (breakouts etc.) from using it and my skin can tend to be sensitive. I highly recommend it."
"Am long-time user of the serum, but current pump dispenser does not work correctly. After bottle is about a third emptied, pump top stays down after each press, forcing user to manually relift the pump head before you can dispense again. Very poor performance, makes use very frustrating."
"I'm almost at end of my 3.4oz bottle of the old formula and was wondering why I couldn't find replacement. Now I know and, based on these reviews, I think I'll pass on the new formula that costs more for less product and check out some of those amazing skin care deals on Groupon. After 20+ years with this product, I could cry."
"BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!!!! skin felt smooth, like something was really working. Bring back the 1.cleanse 2.serum 3.moisturize beauty steps. This product is marketed as a moisturizer as well as a anti-aging serum - it was so simple as just a serum. I have used Oil of Olay brand for many years into my seasoned years - just not satisfied with effectiveness."
"I have used the serum for a long time. I could no longer find it and this seemed the closest to the original. What I loved most about the original was how smoothly it went on and quickly dried, leaving my face feel smooth. This one takes longer and feels a little sticky. I was willing to put up with that if I noticed a marked improvement in overall results, but having finished the bottle, I don't see any benefit to the changes. I am researching other brands."
"This serum has reduced the discoloration on my face, I don't wear foundation or concealer anymore. The new formula is AWESOME! I like like that it doesn't have parabens, and the important ingredients (niacin, peptides) are higher on the ingredient list."
"I got asked about My skin care regimen where normally people tell me what I need to do to improve my skin. I like that the new Regenerist serum has more concentration of the active ingredients (peptides and niacin), and no parabens. I did not purchase the previous formula because of the parabens."
"I have been using regenerist serum since it was first introduced. I loved it, I recommended it to everyone. I am so disappointed in the new formula. The new formula does not feels silky, its very thin, it does not absorb well, it leaves my skin feeling sticky and dry. Please listen to us Olay and bring back the old formula. Until you do, you have lost a very loyal customer here. I have already purchased a different brand and will be using that from now on."
"Used the old serum for YEARS... it was light and silky and made my skin feel amazing and no fragrance. Can't stand the way the new formulation feels -- does not instantly absorb. Old serum felt sinfully good, like a surge of moisture. It was amazing... there's that word, again... AMAZING! Also -- the old bottle was better designed, and easier to pack for travel and liked the way the top turned and locked. So many similar comments. But yet to hear: why did you change it?"
I have been using this serum for years. Maybe I need to get used to this but I wish I had been told the formula changed before buying three bottles together at a warehouse store. It does not have the skin feel of the old formula. Goes on slick and seems to dry out quickly. Because I am thrifty I will use it but will be on the lookout for something else for my aging skin.
"So disappointed that this product was changed. I've used it for years but the new formula is so inferior to the original! If you insist on keeping the new formula, can you just call it Regenerist 2, bring back the original and call it Regenerist Original?! I am abandoning this product now and will go to a different skin care line."
"I have used the original serum for ages. It was the only thing that worked for me and I loved it so much. And now it has been reformulated.....why! Why do companies do this? The new product is awful...nothing like the original. So now I have to find a new product, which for me is not easy because my skin is so sensitive and twitchy. I am so, SO disappointed."
"I have been using this serum ever since the packaging was different! Do you know how old that is!? It happens to be one of my all time favorite skin repairing serums out there! I am glad it has never been discontinued! I never suffered from acne as a teen, but in my twenties, I've had to deal with adult acne. Although people say not to extract, I find that this serum helps regenerate my skin cells from an extraction site. I love it to death!"
"I have been using Olay Regenerist regenerating fragrance-free serum for years. Loved the product! Loved the way it felt on my face and the results it gave me. I am very upset that I can no longer find this product. Why change a good thing? Also, loved the fact that you could unscrew the top to get to the last bit of serum. Very disappointed!"
"My mom and I have used and recommend this product for over 8 years. This new formula is not working for me at all. Now I have no clue what product line to use, because I will not be purchasing this new formula. Wish I could insert a picture of my skin... I've always received compliments over the year and swore by this product as well as the daily facial cloth. I am unhealthy disappointed, why change something if it's not broken."
This new improved formula is not working for me. I just purchased it about 3 weeks ago and will not be purchasing another. I have used regenerist serum for years and have always loved it because my skin felt hydrated all day long. This new formula does not have that silky feel and my skin feels dry in just a few hours. It was huge disappointment.
"I have used Regenerist Regenerating Serum since it was available. People are always asking me what products I use on my face. At the age of 73, I am always pleased to say Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the Regenerist serum and full line of Regenerist products for quite some time now. I am 42 years old and on a recent trip was asked out by two different young men in their twenties! Neither one could believe my true age. The Regenerist serum has prevented wrinkles and keeps me looking a decade younger than I am! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product for years and just love it. It feels like silk on my skin. I have sensitive skin and this has never caused any skin flare ups and is great under makeup. I am 62 and get many compliments on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I bought this, I thought that it was new (white bottle), packaging for the Micro-Sculpting Serum that I have used for years. This one seems lighter in feel, with a soothing almost cooling effect, that will be a definite plus in NY's high humidity summers. Seems to really reduce eye wrinkles. Very happy I tried it. Will purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Serum is nothing like the lotion. You will think your skin is new, not under some hydrating potion. It makes a perfect foundation for blush & powder & you are done, ready to go out. It makes such a difference in the appearance of your skin. I do not have the skin of a 68 years old. I attribute this mostly from using Regenerist Serum. I have used more expensive moisturizer but, prefer your Serum. Thanks for making this superior product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product i think since it came out. Leaves my face so soft and people, including my hair stylist, think I'm at least a decade younger. When waiting to get my Colonoscopy the male nuse came hurrying back to me saying thry had accidentally put th wrong birth year, that they were off by at least 10 years. I had to prove my age with my drivers license. He said he hoped his wife looked that good when she gets my age. I always telll them OLAY Regenerist Serum [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for the past 9 years and Iove it! It makes my face smooth and brightens my complexion. I normally use the Serum in the morning and again before bedtime. In the morning, it makes applying foundation so much easier. I seriously love this product, I do not need anything else for my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this serum for years. It not only lightly hydrates, it keeps my skin exfoliated without abrasion and keeps my pores from getting clogged so I don't get (adult) acne. If I do get a pimple, I dab serum over it and it clears up overnight. Once in awhile I experiment with another product but still find Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum is the best! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Olay Regenerist serum and moisture on my 75 year old face for the past five months and am very pleased with the results. I have been disappointed with so many products that advertise miracles and are not effective. At last I have found a line of products that works for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this serum for about a month now. I use it twice a day under my moisturizer. I love that I only need one pump to cover my whole face. It also has a slightly illuminating formula to it that I like. I will buy it again once it runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this Regenerist serum! It is very lightweight and not stick or heavy feeling. I have been using it for years and my skin looks 10 years younger than my age and I frequently get compliments on my clear, smooth skin. I highly recommend this product to everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using Olay since I was 24, I started with total f2f getting wonderful results, but when I got pregnant I got pregnancy mask so I switched to regenerist and wow!!!! My skin looks so radiant and after 2 months my skin tone is again even, I didn't need any harsh chemical to get ride of dark spots plus I have no wrinkles around my eyes at all and now I'm 39!!! I will stay faithful to Olay forever!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used regular oil of Olay since I was 20. Now that I'm 37 I've started using th Regenerating Serum. I love the way my skin looks and feels! I have yet to get any wrinkles, I know that comes Olay. Start using it while your young before wrinkles like me and you won't see any! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The entire line of Oil of Olay products have always been my favorite by far! I have tried every single brand there is but none of them ever compare to the Oil of Olay products, and the serum is definitely one of my favorites. I always feel super silky smooth skin without the greasy left overs and it feels wonderful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for years. Your skin feels velvety soft. I am 39 years old about to be 40 and people think I'm 32 33 I believe this project has helped me tremendously with keeping my skin looking beautiful and Young plus good genetics helps to [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This serum has a smooth feel and I use it morning and evening. A little bit goes a long ways! I top it with moisturizer in the evening and with my moisturizer and/or foundation in the morning. It has no greasy feel and my skin is primed for make-up. Does not cause my make-up to flake and has improved the overall appearance of my skin. The Regenerist Regenerating Serum is a must for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use a lot of regenerist products. This by far is the ultimate. I love the way my skin feels after applying the serum. They recommend putting moisturizer on top, but I love how silky my skin feels , I usually put on another layer. My teen age daughter laughs at me cause I just gush about my Olay . This product is the bomb! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Regenerist Regenerating serum since it came out. My grandma used Olay and had gorgeous skin! The Regenerist serum is amazing! I appreciate the fragrance one better but since I can only find fragrance - free I still use it daily. People compliment me on my skin and lack of wrinkles at 49. I know the serum helps! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this for many years and I love how it makes my skin feel so soft and I believe it has kept me from getting wrinkles where I should have them. I am 65 years old and have been guessed at 55. That says a lot about this product. I highly recommend this to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't fuss much with my face, but I do use Regenerating Serum. I have been married for 27 years and am 67 years old and my husband still tells me EVERY day ""WHAT GREAT SKIN you have"". Even my daughter says she is hoping for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this treatment for years. I am at midlife and have zero wrinkles. This serum melts right into your skin and is as smooth as silk. I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't like this product, it's that good. I notice also that when high-end fashion magazines review 'the best face treatments' -many with a price tag in the hundreds, at least one Olay product will make the list- at a fraction of the cost. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. It isn't greasy feeling. I love the way it makes my skin feel and look. It is so obvious to me when I don't use it. That is when I see the small lines under my eyes. When I use it they disappear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I alternate between the Regenerist Serum and the Micro Sculpting Serum. I know when I need a little bit more ""lift"" so that is when I reach for this one. My entire vanity and medicine chest are Olay products. They all work amazing. This serum I do use with the scent and its light then I follow with the Micro Sculpting Cream. Love!

"I have used this product for many years. I've tried other similar products but in no way do they compare with Olay. When I tell people I'm 65, they never believe me. They always think I'm much younger. I attribute that to Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Since I stared using the Regenerist Serum it has made a huge difference on my face. The people that I work with notice that my skin is smoother and healthy looking. It took out the red spots from dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I've used this since it came on the market and love it. I dread the day that a newer product will be introduced and this one will be retired, since I don't see how the present formula could be improved upon. I'm 70 years old and am usually mistaken for someone in her early 40s, so it really, really works."
"I have been using this product for several years, and love it. I use it morning and night. I feel as though it has helped my skin look younger and gives it a glow. The compliments I get are constant, as I am 50. People cannot believe my age. I feel as though this product has helped with that. I do have one negative comment...I feel that the new formula isn't quite as good as it was before. The smell and feel of it, was better before they changed it. It doesn't seem as luxurious as it did before."
"I started using this when I moved to the desert, and all off a sudden I had those ugly lines above my lips. I never had any wrinkles, anywhere, before. I have been using regenerist anti-aging now for three months, and I noticed the lines getting smaller, and smaller. They are almost gone, and my skin looks like it did when I was thirty! I just had my fiftyith b'day, so I'm more than pleased with this product!!!!!"
"i have been using this product for about 5 yrs now and it is the best product ever. I never let myself run out. I am a believer that it has made my skin younger, softer, and firmer than it used to be. I am 53 and have been told i look 38. Hows that for a review?"
"I have been using this product for a couple of months now. I think it's a wonderful moisturizer. It hydrates and gives my skin a moisturized, velvety feel...it's a ""great feel""! I love to apply this moisturizer before applying my makeup. It goes on so easily after this serum. I will most likely stick with this one but I do want to try the micro-sculpting serum before making my final decision."
"I use this product along with the cream cleanser and my face is perfectly hydrated and still feels clean and fresh. I've always had a problem with moisturizers because of my sensitive combination skin (They either left my skin flaky in areas and oily in others). I no longer have to do powder touch-ups ALL day long to tackle oily areas nor do I have to worry about flakiness in the dry area. All in all, only after 3 uses my skin looks healthier and more firm. My skin feels perfect!"
I've been using this product for 6 yrs and it is wonderful. It improved the overall look of my skin and I've only added one new wrinkle in all that time. The wrinkles that I had improved in apperance and have not progressed. Everytime I try a different brand my skin looks awful and I switch right back. Only wish it would have been available when I was in my 30's!
"Feb 3, 2010 I had a gastric bypass, after losing a lot of weigt fast my face had started to sag and the laugh line were deep. I have been using this for just 1 week and I am amazed at the results... the lines seem to be filling out and less dark. I really needed this boost, was a bummer to be slimmer to only look older... I am happy with the results... will buy more of the products, love the reasonable prices. Thank you P&G"
I decided to try Regenerist b/c I started using Covergirl's Simply Ageless makeup with Regenerist serum in it and love it. This combo has really made my skin look a lot better. I wasn't expecting much but I have been surprised. My skin really looks and feels better. Worth a try for sure.
I use Regenerist Serum every morning as a foundation for my mineral makeup. It allows my makeup to go on smoothly and helps it stay on all day long. Can't live without it. Have used more expensive primers in the past but always come back to Olay. Here to stay!
"Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum delivers a silky, non-sticky product that gives a smooth look to the skin; have noticed a significant reduction in pore size after using for a couple of weeks. Would like to see a more ""concentrated"" version of this made by Olay as I like the look and feel of Regenerist so much that I find myself applying it more than once a day."
I have been purchasing and using this product from the time it was sold to consumers. It has kept my skin young and helps to repair any flaws my skin may develop. I only use in the am and do not miss a day. I am always told that I look younger so Thank You Olay for a great product. I will try other products to help add to my younger look and feel.
"I have problem skin, if I don't use a good moisturizer, my skin will get flaky and itchy red patches (ugh!). After using Olay regenerist daily regenerating serum the very first time, my skin began healing-it felt better than it had in a long time. I use it daily (for 6 years or so) and have never had a relapse of the horriable red patches!"
"Regenerist is ""soft"" it feels wonderful on my skin. I'v seen improvement to fine wrinkles in a very short amount of time. I would like a larger bottle to be availabel at retailers. I 've recommened this product to my sisters, mother and mother -in-law!"
I USE THE DAILY SERUM EVERY MORNING BEFORE I PUT ON MY MAKEUP. YOUR SKIN LOOKS AND FEELS SO MUCH BETTER. IT WORKS FIND UNDER YOUR MAKEUP. I WOULD TELL ANYONE THAT MY SKIN OVERALL IS SO MUCH BETTER SINCE I HAVE BEEN USING REGENERIST DAILY REGENERATING SERUM.
"This little dude is my favorite product, a little of him goes along way in beautifying my face. Softens and smoothes in seconds and leaves no greasy residue, I layer it under my moisturizer and foundation piece of cake, pleasant scent and easy to apply, gentle on my sensitive skin...way to go Oil of Olay !"
"I initially used a free sample my sister received. After 2+ weeks of applying the serum daily after I washed my face in the morning, the visual difference was significant. The tired look was gone, and the skin texture was softer while firmer. I have been a loyal consumer since."
"OK, not really, but close. Something about this serum just soaks right into your skin and leaves it feeling totally refreshed and moisterized and --- dare I say it? --- younger feeling. For real. Love this product. Also a gatekeeper to the rest of the Regenerist line. Good stuff."
"I've been using different moisturizers since I was 16yrs old. I always end up with dry skin or oily skin or blemishes. SinceI've tried Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum I've had no problems with my skin. It goes on so smooth and it doesn't take a lot to be moisterized. The bottle might be smaller than other brands, but it actually lasts longer! I recommend all women and men should try it!"
"I have used the fragrance-free version of this serum ever since it came on to the market, and I love the way it makes my face feel. Soothing, lightly hydrating, and my skin functions better overall. I use 3 pumps morning and night (more than the bottle suggests), and I generally use 1 bottle per month. Great stuff! I don't feel it ""lifts"" or gives a face lifted appearance, but it makes the skin look and feel overall better."
"I work outside a great deal of the time. and I do not wear a hat! Being in the sun was causing a lot of discoloration as well as wrinkles and dry skin. I used a facial cream that was not helping. I noticed no difference. Finally, I took a chance and purchased Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum and after usiing for one month, my co-workers remarked that there was something different about me. What had I done? I informed them that I had bought the Regenerist by Olay and that it was really working. Thank You!"
"I'm very cautious when it comes puting anything to my face. I have a very sensitive skin, I always get a bad reaction almost any product, I break out right away within a matter of cuople hours. Since I'm already passed 30, I'm seeing some lines under my eyes and in my laugh line, so far this is the only product that works on me. After I used it for a week , I've seen the magic result. I felt like my skin looks 20 and the top of that, No harsh reaction at all..."
I use this product everyday as the first step in my skincare regimen. I live in a very humid climate and this does not feel heavy or greasy (such a plus)!!!!! My skin feels incredibly soft after application. It truly helps the appearance of my skin!!!!
"With the help of a $5 coupon I decided to try the Daily Regenerating Serum. As an older woman I wasn't expecting dramatic results but was I impressed! I used it daily and after about a month I looked in the mirror and realized that my crow's feet and under eye ""bags"" were greatly minimized. And the lines that run from my nose and the corners of my mouth seemed to be less noticeable. Over all, my skin has a better appearance with less blotchiness. I will definitely buy again...even if I don't have a coupon!"
"I am typically very skeptical about skin care products, but I have to say, this serum works. My skin is more hydrated and the fine lines around my eyes have actually diminished. This product makes my skin so smooth and helps my makeup go on better too."
have been using this produuct for the last 3 years and found my skin to looking wonderful. I have been a faithful Oil of Olay user for the past 25 years and my family and friends have noticed and make comments on my complextion...thanks every so much for constantly updating products for us older ladies
"This product visibly improved my skin surface (""puffed out"" to get rid of small lines). It also evened out discolorations. In a test, I used the Regerating Serum on one cheek and a Shiseido product on the other for 3 weeks. The Olay side looked better. Although this is a great product I prefer the fragrance free version."
I always use Regenerist before applying make up as it is thee only product I have found that moisturizes my skin and allows perfect blending of my foundation. I have tried numerous other products and have found this to be the most effective solution. The cream is almost silicon like allowing my makeup to glide over my skin for a flawless finish. I wouldn't be caught without it.
"I love the Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum as it makes my skin feel so soft and supple. I use it under my makeup and at night. There's no greasy feel or shiny face. It absorbs quickly and moisturizes wonderfully. . And it smells great. I highly recommend it, especially for dry skin."
I have been using this product for several months now (possibly a year). More of a preventative measure. My skin is so silky smooth when I use this. Works great with or without a moisturizer. I love it and recommend it. I use daily with a SPF moisturizer and eye cream both from Oil of Olay.Love to exfoilliate and use right after.
"My best friend, Sharon, gave me a bottle of Olay's Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum about six years ago, saying she couldn't live without it! She was right - it's now the first thing I apply after cleansing my face. It feels wonderful and ""preps"" my skin for the Regenerist Eye Lifting Serum and Micro-Sculpting Cream that goes on next! These three Regenerist products work together to help my skin stay moist and glowing - THREE REALLY WONDERFUL SKIN SAVERS I can't do without!!"
Love this product
This is one of my favorite drugstore serums. I personally love the fragrance. The formula is not greasy and absorbs well into the skin.
"The new formula absolutely does not agree with my skin, it's not as smooth and silky either, Less product at a higher price.PLEASE bring back the old formula!!!!!"
"...and less volume at a high price. Seriously? It appears to be all about $$$. OLAY blew it! After years of raving to my friends about the former serum, I now am bailing and so are my friends."
"I'm disappointed. I've used the regenerist serum for years and its worked just fine, but you guys have messed it up. Wish you had just stuck with your original winning formula and the large 3+oz dispensers. It worked."
I am so glad that I am not the only one who is unhappy with the new regenerist regenerating serum. I think the old one was more silky and absorbed better
The new formula is different. It's not as silky and doesn't make my face feel smooth like the old version. Please bring back the old version or you may have lost a customer.
"I have tried other products, but always come back to this. It is very light and goes on so smoothly. Many other products I have tried have a strong smell and are heavy feeling. I think this is Olay's best product!"
"I love the fragrance free serum, but am not sure if I need to use a moisturizer over serum all the time. I have used just the serum, except when I use my color foundation over it. I have always had great skin."
"This serum is light and non-greasy, but makes my skin feel so soft and smooth. My makeup glides on over it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I used the ""pretty pink lotion"" for many years, since the regenerist serum was introduced I have used it and have found none better infact I have used it on my hands and neck also,"
"I like the fragrance and the way it absorbs, but bottle is almost empty, and can tell no difference in my skin at all. Will never buy Olay products again."
"From what I can tell, after 1 month of using this product, my skin feels smoother, firmer and refreshed. I can't wait to explore other regenerist products."
"Olay Regenerist Serum and Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream are the best products,your skin has never looked better,smooth,glowing,moisturized,hydrates,reduces the wrinkles and look younger. Thanks Olay."
I barely started using the microderm kit with the Regenerating Serum and it is doing wonders for my skin!! My skin feels so soft and the fine lines are diminishing! Beats out higher priced department store skin products for sure!
i dont know how i went so long without this product. it is great! it feels great and doesnt make me break out....i think it's actually shrinking my pores!
"The first time I used this product, my skin already looked smoother and more even. I have oily skin so can't use it on my nose or chin, but for the rest of my face it's the best thing I've ever used."
Very impressed and satisfied. Saw actual improvements with 3 weeks or less. My skin is brighter and feel wonderful. I have recommended this to many of my friends and co-worker. A true believer. Thank you Olay
"Okay so my mom gave me a sample of this fantastic product, and boy is it great!! It made my skin feel like silk. I am definitely going to by this product. Thanks again Olay!"
I've done skin care in physician offices for years. Regenerist products are as good as or better than prescriptive products....now if we could only get the insurance companies to pay for it!
I tried Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum when it first came on the market. I loved it then and continue to do so. I love the way it feels--very silky. It absorbs quickly and is the perfect moisturizer under Bare Escentuals makeup.
"I have been using this for years, tried a few other products and always went back to this. It makes my skins feel so smooth and diminishes the lines on my 40 someting face."
I can't begin my day without this product. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth. Also I have very sensitive skin and this product doesn't irritate.
"I have allergies and sensitive skin - this product works well for me. It is gentle, while doing an excellent job of softening and hydrating. I love the feel of it on my skin."
"This is a wonderful Olay product. The fragrance is refreshing and the serum texture is silky smooth leaving a wonderful non-greasy layer of facial skin nutrients. I use it daily, I see and feel the differance. I love this product."
I started using Regenerist Serum several years ago and I would not be without it. There are skin care items I have had to cut back on due to the economy but Regenerist Serum is not one of them!
"I've used Oily of Olay products for over 20 years and recently tried the regenerist daily serum. It's hard to improve what I thought was great, but the regenerist line has made my skin better!"
I use the Serum morning and night and love the silky feel. The non-greasy formula is light yet effective and does seem to diminish the look of fine lines.
"this is the best face cream, hands down. it makes my skin feel silky smooth. i can apply my blush immediately after i use it, and there is no spotting or caking. i recomend it to everyone, and can't stop raving about it!"
Just celebrated 50th people think i'm late 30's i say no.. it's regenerist .. the serum makes my skin smooth and so soft .. hydrated .. no wrinkles here!

I love the way Olay Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum feels on my skin. I use it every morning after washing my face. My skin has a more youthful appearance and it feels softer. It also has a more even tone.
I have been using Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum for years and will never stop. I am currently 55 and most people think I am in my early 40's. Three cheers for Olay Products.
I purchased this product because I am in my late thirty's and I started to notice some small wrinkles. It has worked well on reducing them and as an added bonus it cleared up small pimples on my forehead. This is a great product!
"I use this under my eyes instead of the eye serum because it's a better value. It works great! I also use it above my mouth, in between my eyes and my frown lines. I call it my super serum!!"
Great product. It works.
You can keep this new formula. I used your product for years because it worked and had such a light feel. This new product feels heavy and sticky. I have been forced to leave your product line. Hope some young cowboy moved their career along with ingenious idea.
With PALMITOYL PENTAPEPTIDE-3 also known as melastysyl which reduces wrinkles
I have problems with moisturizers bothering my skin. I don't have any problems with this product. It makes my skin feel silky smooth.
"It was far superior to this...just no comparison to how well the old formula worked. Read the reviews here, many feel the same."
Foolish to change a wonderful product and make it stink. Literally stink by adding perfume. Go back to the old formula!
Why are you changing the entire line? The old line was perfect. Very disappointed in the new formula. You've lost a customer.
There are very few products I can use on my face without bad reactions. This product was effective without terrible side effects!

When I wash my face afterwards it is dry. When I put the serum it my skin is much softer and not dry.
I recently started using the regenerating Serum and I love it. My skin feels softer and my makeup looks better. I am an Olay fan!
"This product makes my skin feel so soft and smooth - it's magical. And boy, does my skin look great. i can't live without it!"

This serum feels and smells great. It's quickly absorbed by my skin and leaves it feeling fresh and taken care of - no greasy residue.
I find this product to be a wonderful addition to your line. I love the way it feels on my face and the way it looks
"I'll be seventy-nine this month. I use it daily and love this product. Even my dermatologist says ""no wrinkles"". I say thank you Olay!"
This product doesn't feel oily after application. It feels light but I'm not sure if small breakouts are due to using this.
I love this product I put this on right after I get out of the shower and it just soaks up in to my skin . IT GIVES ME A more youthful look!
This product is worth it's weight in gold. Goes on smoothly and gets right to work lifting the delicate skin around my eyes.
"I love the way it feels on my skin....the softness and moisture. It feels like my skin is shield. Now, I feel naked without having it on my face."
"I guess it works for some people , didn't do a thing for me. I still have the same lines I had before I used it. No change at all. And the price is ridiculous."
didn't notice a real difference from other products that claim 2 do the same thing 4 around the same price point. final words: if olay works 4 -get it. if u haven't tried products from olay -skip it.
"Please bring back old product, new one is not silky and smooth as old one"
"Not happy with this new formula, bring back the old one."
Ilove this serum. Helps you to look young. Im 29 but they think im only in HS!! Lol!!!!
Greaseless wonder is what I like to say.. works awesomely
This product is amazing and is everything they advertise
