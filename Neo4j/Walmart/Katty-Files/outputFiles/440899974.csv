"I absolutely love this body wash! I actually look forward to getting in the shower now because it is such a treat to use this luxurious, creamy wash. And it smells AMAZING! I won't go back to any other product now because I love this one so much. Thanks for making this miracle product, Olay. I am obsessed!"
"This product is amazing because it leaves your skin feeling so refreshed. This scent is so natural and fresh, not overwhelming at all. A small amount of the foam goes a long way so you can get a lot out of one bottle which is awesome. Also loving this price point!"
I am so pleased with this product. Not only does it smell like I am surrounded by a garden full of fresh lavender flowers but you don't have to worry about wasted product because once you release the foam it doesn't slide off your hand (even if you flip it). It stays until you're ready to lather and use.
"Wonderful and clean! Olay, Make this in body spray and lotion form plz!!!!!"
"I tried the Olay Foaming Whip Body Wash in Birch Water and Lavender. I am absolutely in love with this product. The texture is thick and rich and creamy, but yet feels as light as air. A small amount is all you need to get enough lather to wash your entire body. There was no drying of my skin, I was left soft and silky. The smell lingered on my skin, I could smell it all day. I can't wait to try the other scents as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I brought this product do to a colab you did with a youtuber named Zabrena who give it wonderful reviews. But I have to say since I bought it it speaks for itself. it so wonderful and long lasting I can't believe how long it really lasts its so excellent. Thank you olay!
I wanted to try this and it was wonderful. So creamy and it leaves your skin lightly fragranced all day.
This product seriously feels like a dream! The foamy texture feels so silky on your skin. The smell is just an added bonus!
"This product is so fun to use in the shower, smells incredible, and leaves the skin hydrated and smelling great all day long. I love all of the scents in this line, but Birch Water & Lavender is my absolute favorite. A fool proof, fun wash to use in the shower, I'd recommend this to everyone!"
Honestly love how it feels on my skin and the way it lathers smoothly really gives you a pleasant bath experience. Its a smooth formula that starts off as a whipped foam and forms into a nice rich lather and I noticed a very smooth and non residue application.
I was skeptical about this product because I had never used a foam before but I have absolutely loved it! It goes on so smooth and is so gentle on my skin which is a must for me. It's so soft and all three scents are amazing! Highly recommend this product!
This Olay flaming whip body wash is so fun and smells amazing!!! It comes out of the can nice and easy and lathers nicely.
"The only negative thing I feel is that it will run out fast. I feel that this product is good for those who maybe want to switch things up, add excitement to their shower routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a fun new take on body wash and I really enjoyed using the product. I found the scent very pleasant and it was fun to have it come out of the container. I think it was nice and thick and really made it feel like a special moment in the shower. I do wonder how long the product will last but I think it is fun and a great price point.

I can see this olay whip being very popular with my kids because it was really fun to use. I'm going to have to hide it. I didn't expect that it would lather as well as it did. I could've used less even. It smells perfumey in a nice way.
This is much quicker than traditional body washes. Mainly because it comes out of the bottle quite quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product would be nice for anyone trying to try a whipped body wash, which is pretty innovative. I tried the product in the shower. I did not like that it dispensed so quickly, because I felt like it was wasteful. I liked the overall scent, but I felt like it could have been stronger. The whipped product evaporated quickly on my arms, before I really had a chance to rub it in. It did I leave my skin feeling soft, which was nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the texture, smell, and lather of the Olay Foaming Whip Body Wash! It is such a luxurious bath experience. This is so much more rich than other foaming pumps that contain mostly air. This body wash smells amazing and really cleans my skin! I love using it with a loofah or just by itself. A little goes a long way!! A++ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is super light and good for someone who does not require a lot of lather. I did not like the texture (way too much like my hair mousse) and lack of a lather. I did not feel clean after and the nozzle was poorly secured. I love olsy products just not this one. It does not live up to the quality. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay Foaming Whip Body Wash stood up to its claims. It had a thick lather that was easy to use and smelled amazing. It left my skin feeling moisturized and soft. I felt that it was a good choice for a light cleansing, but I am not sure how well it would do if you were really dirty from doing yard work or another outdoor activity. The foaming action did startle me initially, but it was fine once I knew what to anticipate. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I sampled the birch water and lavender scent. I liked the way it dispensed from the container and the smell was great. I was a little disappointed that it didn't lather up very well and the amount required was too much. I did like how it felt on my skin and the scent that it left. I think the price was reasonable.

"I bought the Birch water and lavender Olay foaming whip body wash. I like it a lot. I like the texture of the soap in the shower and I like how I do not need a poof or loofah to use the soap. My skin felt moisturized, though I still used lotion and body oil after my shower. I liked the lightly fragranced foam. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very impressed with this product. The texture was a delight, smooth and very soft. It came out a little fast so be ready. It foamed up immediately and was very refreshing. Great product to use right now with the high heat wave we are having. I would recommend this product to everyone. The smell was a little strong and lasted a long time.

"Olay foaming whip wash leaves no residue and left my skin feeling smooth. I was worried at first because the smell was almost overpowering while showering, but once out of the shower my skin was left with a light, lingering scent. The can has a bit of a hair trigger and my first time using it I dispensed way too much product. Just lightly tap the top and yoou'll be good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This scent makes me feel like I'm showering in a field of lavenders, haha. I love that the foam is lightweight and a little goes a long way. I love using it to shave my legs since the foam stays put & it leaves my skin feeling silky smooth."
Love these new whip body washes! They leave your skin so soft and clean. They leave a soft beautiful scent on the skin that really creates an enjoyable experience. Definitely give these a try!
The Birch Water & Lavender is the best but they all smell so so good! The product goes a long way and makes me skin feel so soft and clean without any product being wasted.
"This is the most luxurious body wash I've ever used! It's lightweight, but lathers into such amazing foam. Highly recommend."
"Three words ""Christmas Gift Set!I love these whips Very fun shower uses!Now I can't wait to shower with this product!"
