"This is a therapeutic, skin hydrating, anti-aging formula. Add a small amount of any organic oil into this lotion and it immediately absorbs into skin. I am age 62 having no wrinkles."
I love this Skin moisturizer! I use it on more than just me face. It does wonders for my skin and I recommend it highly!!
"this product is Excellent for my extremely dry skin, i haven't had any product work like this, goes on smooth"
"Good product, fast shipping."
"I was not happy when I received this as it was advertised like it was the original formula. Unfortunately it is NOT! Still trying to figure out why a company trys to fix something that isn't broke. This new formula doesn't compare to the original. On the bright side, when I called St. Ives to complain I was issued a full refund. Still looking for a replacement lotion that will make me happy."
