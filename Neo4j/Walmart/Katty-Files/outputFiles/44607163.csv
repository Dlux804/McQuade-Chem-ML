"I have used this product for years, and felt like I needed to write a review. I have eczema and very sensitive skin, and this works like a charm. Absolutely no irritation when I apply it, and my skin looks really healthy. This product is moisturizing and feels so good on my skin. I haven't had flaky, dry skin for years, and I attribute a lot of that to this product."
"I have dry skin that has the tendency to get oily throughout the day if I don't properly moisturize in the morning. I actually use the PM moisturizer as my morning moisturizer because it's lightweight, goes really well under a primer and if I add a little setting powder on top then I don't get oily throughout the day. I love the cerave brand!"
"I am constantly on the hunt for good, better, best skincare products and this one - the PM Facial Moisturizing Lotion - is great. As good, I'd even say better, than any I have tried at any price point, and I'm 65 (Lord! Where did the time go!) so I have tried many, high-end, low-end, and in the middle. Love the ingredients, love the texture - light, fast-absorbing, soothing. I have nothing but good things to say about it."
I love how soft this lotion makes my skin. My skin feels very moisturized. I am hoping it will improve the condition of my skin...
Great product!! But why is the sodium hydroxide so high on the ingredients list and why is it not on the ingredients list u have u on this site. Was it removed
"A bottle of this lotion will last me a long time so I was shocked to see the label had new language since my last purchase. ""Ultra Lightweight"". When I saw that I was immediately concerned. The reason I use CereVe PM is because of the thin consistency. The new ultra lightweight is not as thin as what I had in my prior bottle. I still had some left and was able to compare. Ultra lightweight is not a thick lotion, it's just not as thin as the prior version. I'll give it a chance but am disappointed with the change."
"I find the CeraVe PM moisturizing lotion to be heavy and greasy. An hour after applying it its still tacky. Im afraid with continued use, I will break out. Stopping it after one application. It is not for me. Disappointed"
"I have raved about your night cream dor the last three years, why would you change it? It's completely mediocre now. Bad move for your loyal customers. This was the most incredible moisturizer!"
"I have raved about your night cream for the last three years, why would you change the formula? Really a bummer for people who found something that had worked so well. This was the most incredible moisturizer! Now, sorry to say, pretty average."
I love this product! I've had a hard time finding moisturizers that work for me. I love this product. They also make one that sunscreen in it and it is amazing too! I have very dry and sensitive skin and this product is very gentle and hydrating.
"For the first time the lotion felt too thick and it left my skin feeling dry.It also smells different. I used to love this lotion but sadly, will have to look for something else. I hate it when companies change formulas! UGH!"
This moisturizer is incredible. No matter how sensitized my skin is from my prescription retinoids and various cleansers this moisturizer feels soooo soothing on my face. Its light and layers well. If they sold massive bottles of this i would buy!
"I love this product and I'm very picky about moisturizers. I have oily skin but I would recommend this to friends with dry skin as well. When I wake up my skin feels hydrated still, but not oily. Im impressed with how light weight it is, I have found my go-to at night moisturizer."
My skin loves everything about this lotion! All the ingredients are perfect and I will continue to use this in my skincare routine!
I like this moisturizer for my face because it is light and not greasy but keep my face feeling smooth and soft. My face does not feel dry even in the winter months. It helps to keep the fine lines less noticeable.
I love Cerave products for my oily skin but this PM moisturizer is not for me. I'm confused because the box said “normal to dry skin” but here the description said “ideal for oily skin”...
"This is very conforting on very sensitive combination skin, and because it's fragrance free and absorbs nicely I don't have to worry about irritations."
"I bought this product and LOVED it! I ran out, and went to purchase my second bottle.... What happened? The texture of the second bottle I bought is MUCH heavier then my first bottle. I like this product because it was light, non scented, and it just worked! I'm bummed about this second purchase. It's expensive and I hate it. Hopefully I just got a bad bottle and they didn't change anything about it."
I loved the original version of the CeraVe PM Facial Moisturizing lotion and used it night and day but then you changed the formula and now it breaks me out and pills under my makeup. My skin is very resistant and nothing breaks me out I was so surprised to find out that you had changed the formula! Very disappointed and will not be repurchasing or recommending to my friends again.
It leaves my skin feeling very hydrated and soft.
Would recommend to anyone
"This is a very good product. It used to be completely odorless, however the last bottle I bought has a very slight fragrance. It smells a tiny bit like Noxzema. It's not a deal-breaker and I'm hoping it was just an oddity with this one bottle. I much preferred it completely odorless.."
"I love using this cream! It's non greasy, absorbs well into your skin and my face feels truly nourished and hydrated!"
I had a bad rosacea flare-up and this brought it back to baseline overnight.
Ceteareth-20 and Cetearyl Alcohol Are pore clogging. Look it up if you are doubtful. They are also high on the ingredient list.
"I have sensitive skin, prone to redness. This moisturiazer is non-greasy, soaks in nicely, and has improved my skin in the first week of use."
