I ordered this lotion online and using it for almost three weeks now. I can visibly notice the difference in my skin texture which is more toned and smooth. I love the product and for sure I am going to buy it again and again.
"This is my number one lotion! My niece gave me this as a gift, and after the first week of using this, everyone I came in contact with, mentioned the difference they noticed in my skin. That was good enough for me to start comparing a few photographs I had previously taken to newer ones. They were right! Now that it's more like a few weeks into using it, I am pleased to say, I'm hooked. Thanks, L'Oreal!!!"
"This product, used in conjunction with their other Triple Lzr product, delivers. Easily absorbed and not greasy."
Since I am using this wonderful day lotion my skin look radient and with a softness that it never had.my dark spots seems deminiish they seems to fade my pores are less noticeable. Goodbye dull skin.and hellowpretty.
I buy this regularly .very good product.
"I use retinoid and used this as a test. I applied 3 times between 6:45am and 11:00 am. I know spf is supposed to be good for 2 hours but I work on a 75 min schedule. On a bright with no clouds day, this spf worked. Not for my regular routine as I apply alot of spf to protect my skin. I'm African American with brown skin. Silky, smooth, great smell and no bumps or burning after application. *The scent is intoxicating. Week my cats think so. When I put it on, they can't stop smelling my face."
I used this for 2 weeks and my face feels smoother and moisturized. When it gets colder out my skin tends to get dry. This product really helped. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the moisturizer but not knowing how much is in the bottle is very disappointing. Didn't know how much was there and totally ran out this morning! No moisturizer this morning! There should be some sort of indication to show the amount left.
"I have been searching for a good multi use product that combines a good sunscreen and primer with a good blurring effect for fine lines. I can't review how well this worked for those features because the very strong fragrance prevented me from even trying it on. Please reconsider this formula or make a fragrance free. This current formula is too strong of a scent and not a pleasant one either, sort of overpowering mixed florals."
"This Loreal triple power day lotion definitely makes your skin feel protected from the sun, however it is highly fragrant if you are sensitive that may bother your skin. I also noticed that it did somewhat irritate my face. I would definitely recommend this moisturize to someone that does not have sensitive skin."
"This is my new moisturizer! It is super gentle and so moisturizing. I see the difference every day. I have acne and tried to find a moisturizer that doesn't break my skin out, but that also isn't so gentle that it does not do anything. This is the best so far!"
"I just bought this product and although goes on smoothly, it has a scent that is really annoying. I put it on my hand (top) to test first, to make sure I don't have an allergic reaction to it. The scent is still so strong. I am not sure I want to put this on my face . Why don't you still have the day lotion that you made before. The scent was unnoticeable and I bought it all the time, until I could not find it anymore. :("
"I had surgery for a deviated septum and to repair a nose fracture four months ago. A side effect is my nose is more susceptible to the sunburns, even when it's not sunny. Paris L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Moisturizer Facial Day Lotion Spf 20 has been great at preventing sunburns and has kept my skin really soft. It goes on great under makeup. It's also light and smells nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found this product- L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20, to be quite easy and enjoyable. The product had a nice smell but was not heavily scented. It was light and easy to use. The only thing this lotion is lacking would be a bit higher of an SPF- for use during long summer days. However, It is still a great product, and I will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the Day Lotion because it fits all of my requirements for a moisturizer and then some! First off it has a SPF which is a must if you're trying to keep your skin looking youthful. Secondly it is very moisturizing! An added benefit from my traditional moisturizer is that it seemed to leave my skin with a subtle glow which made my skin look incredibly healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how lightweight this moisturizer is and how quickly it absorbed into my skin - it didn't feel greasy or heavy and I was able to apply my makeup primer and foundation right after. And it works! I haven't experienced my usual flaky skin that I get when the weather changes and my face glows and looks fresh and plump. I've even found myself skipping foundation some days! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After two weeks of use I saw a major improvement in my skin texture. I cannot believe the difference, fine lines have disappeared and my skin is glowing again. This Lotion is way better than other brands that cost 5x. Love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have combo skin. This moisturizer balanced my sensitive skin. It did not make my face oily, but did a great job of moisturizing my dry spots. I like the fact that it has an SPF. It also did not break me out like many other moisturizers do. It was a nice base for my foundation. I don't really like face products with fragrance, but it faded quickly. After using this product for three weeks, I feel my face looks a bit more radiant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this product. I used it as recommended with the other 2 products. I noticed after a few weeks, if i didnt use the cream, my face would be really dry. After 3 weeks, the resukts were nice. Smooother skin. I changed after 4 weeks to using just one cream in the morning and night instead of using 2 or 3 each time. Since i had results, i wanted to save money by just using 1 at a time. Nice fragrance and not oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think L'Oréal L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 is a wonderful product! Not only does it moisturize it also has a SPF of 20! It feels light and airy, soaks right into my skin. There is no heavy greasy feel. Goes on great, dries extremely fast and my makeup slides on right over it! L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 is a great product and excited tell the rest of the ladies I ride motorcycles with about this… [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is another great product from Loreal. Goes on like silk, feels great and better yet, it protects the skin from the effects of the sun! What more could a girl want.....I will continue to use this product. Try it--you'll love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this lotion. It absorbs quickly and doesnt leave an oily residue. My make up applies well also. I have noticed that my skin appears brighter which I love. It also pairs well with the other two products in the regimen. My only issue is that applying three products to my face in the morning before my make up is a little time consuming. I would prefer if there was just one or two products to apply. Otherwise this line is great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the Day Lotion Moisturizer is a good product. I like that it contains a Broad Spectrum SPF 20. My skin feels nice after using this product. I've noticed some of my dark spots have faded since using the product. I would recommend the day moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked that I had no side effects since most day lotions with sunscreen usually make me breakout, even ones for sensitive skin. I'm always looking for something that sinks right in and doesn't irritate my skin. Lovely scent and I've actually seen an improvement in texture and skin tone with the combined power from the trio, Serum, Moisturizer and the Day Lotion. So glad I gave this product a shot! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've worn sunscreen daily for 20+ years now but don't have a favorite. This one is just as good as any other I've used. It's not oily, sinks right in, the fragrance isn't overbearing. I'll use it daily until it's gone. Not sure if I would buy it because other less expensive ones are just as good for my use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only used the L""Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 a few times over the last couple of weeks. I like the scent but I didn't feel it absorbed the best. It didn't seem to feel greasy or heavy. I prefer the Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I could only give this product three stars. I wanted it to be good, but ultimately it wasn't the best. I love the fact that it had SPF in it, but the real problem for me is that when I applied my makeup over it, it would pill up into little rolls all over my face & clothes, even after giving it ample time to dry/absorb. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I live in California and suncreen is important to us ladies everyday as lipstick. Just a quick jog to the market or as a basecoat for my makeup that lasts all day while I run about doing chores I know my skin is protected. Don't forget your neck, throat and décolletage. Lovely product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tired the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 and out of all 3 products, this one worked the best for my super sensitive skin. It did give my skin some added mosisturizer and I love that it has some protection against the sun but I wish it had a little more because I tend to burn easily. It went on smooth and my face felt comfortable wearing it all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The SPF worked great under my make up and didn't leave any cakiness. It has a pleasant scent. A little bit does go a long way especially if you're looking for a quality product. Even on the days I didn't wear make up my skin felt great. Although I have oily skin, it was never a factor w/these products from Bzzagent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This loreal triple power is amazing I'm using it for weeks and my skin face is totally different more soft more juvenile so far I'm impressed with the results I recommend this product to any one in my job and with my family and friends this is the best.

"I tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20. I usually break out when I put SPF on my face, but I was pleasantly surprised to find I didn't have too many problems. It was a little greasy, but that is to be expected with this type of product. It kept my skin moisturized all throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this L'Oreal SPF Lotion for several days. It is lighter and less greasy than some of the products I have used in the past. However, the smell is a bit too flowery for my taste, and lingered a bit too long. I wish I did like the fragrance because it is always difficult to find an SPF lotion that wears so well under makeup and doesn't feel oily all day. Would recommend this to anyone who enjoys the scent - but it just wasn't for me unfortunately. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was not a fan of the moisturizer or the serum treatment because they broke out my skin and still left me dry. However, the Day Lotion was a slight improvement over the others. It left me feeling protected, but was lighter and less greasy than other SPFs I normally use. That said, I didn't like the smell of it, which tended to linger for several hours. Probably won't buy this again... but I didn't dislike it either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I typically use a separate SPF cream from my moisturizer but tested this out for 2 weeks. The fragrance from this product was very tolerable. Unfortunately this product made my skin feel much less moisturized than my current regime and my skin did not feel as smooth. I would probably not purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was hoping for a nice, rich moisturizer that would fill in my fine lines. This smells nice, but the texture is very watery and slippery. When it's first applied it feels almost oily. Within 5 minutes, it feels like I haven't put moisturizer on my face at all except that my nose feels oily. Does not help with my fine lines either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Been using this product for 2 weeks... feels great on my skin. No breakouts and my skin doesn't feel oily. Not sure I see any reduction in wrinkles or dark spots however. It feels great under makeup and my skin does feel smoother. I'll continue to use it though for now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This sunscreen it great! This product is also light-weight and non-greasy. I love having my my daily moisturizer with sunscreen. I really wished that the pump had a locking feature in case the the top was ever to become lost. I feel like the day lotion used with the serum and moisturizer work well together and leaves the skin looking bright and refreshed. I would definitely recommend this line to friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Very impressed with this one. I usually feel the products with SPF protection are thicker and don't absorb quickly. This product is just the opposite. It is light and absorbs very quickly. Noticeable improvement to the look and feel of my skin. So much softer and smoother. Will definitely be continuing to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The daily moisturizer is light and absorbs very quickly making it easy to add it into your daily makeup routine . I love the fact that it has protection from the sun added to it as well. My face is a place I always avoid putting traditional sunscreen so that is very handy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A lot of day moisturizers with great uv protection tend to feel greasy but not L'Oreal Paris Rivitalift triple power day lotion. The lotion was very lightweight and absorbed into my skin nicely. It kept my skin protected as well as diminished my dark spots from acne and sunbathing. Definitely a winner!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I waited to use this product thinking I would use it when I would be in the sun a lot but realized it would help me get a good lotion on my skin and help even out my foundation. I have been using this product all week and it goes on light while still providing the additional moisture that my face needs daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the L'Oreal RevitaLift Day Lotion. I have combination skin and have a lot of trouble with daytime moisturizers. However, during the cooler months the dry batches can be a bit noticeable. This product really helped without clogging my pores or causing any breakouts. It also never felt greasy and worked well under my makeup. I loved the SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wanted to learn more about the ingredients and was able to read about the product on their website. I began using this daily and found it to have almost no scent and to be easy to use. I haven't noticed much improvement on deeper lines on my face but the finer lines are less noticeable and my skin is very hydrated. This is an excellent product for dry winter skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been on the search for a good everyday sunscreen. This one fit the ticket. It smells fresh and clean and it goes on smoothly. It absorbs quickly into my skin and I will feel more protected from the sun. Great product. I will definitely continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am sure this product is great for someone who has extremely dry, flaky skin. But if you have the littlest bit of any oil to your face then I must say avoid this product. It will make your skin EXTREMELY greasy and shiny and forget about wearing any make up with this, it will definitely slide right off. The texture was OK, the smell was nice, but the remaining slicked heavy greasy feeling it left was hard for me to get past. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Any moisturizer that adds in SPF is a win for me. Even though it is Fall where I live, the sun is still out. I love that I have the extra layer of protection and it is designed for my face so it's not clogging pores or causing breakouts. It isn't greasy or thick like a typically SPF as it goes on light and thin. It isn't a strong scent either, it is light and hardly noticeably scented. I would recommend this product and purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was as good if not better than the other two products I tried. Most sunscreens have a tacky feel and don't do much for your skin. This felt more like a moisturizer than a sun screen. It was smooth and light with a pleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After I used these products and seen how great there are I shared them with my mom and the difference in her face was so great her skin had been like leather and now she has very soft skin and wrinkles are fading as well we both will continue to use these products...

"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF was better than most. Non greasy. I like the L'Oreal Paris Triple Power Concentrated Facial Serum Treatment the very best of all three items. The Day Lotion is best to use when you will be out in the sun a lot. It goes on easy and moisturizes. It seems a bit heavy on my face, but not greasy or oily. I would use this product if the Serum Treatment was unavailable.

"This skincare is doing something good, my skin felt smoother and looked clearer after using for over a week. The nightcream is just a little too thick but all in all very good for living in dry Nevada! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a light weight lotion, good for use under makeup or bare skin. Best for normal skin and definitely not for acne prone skin. The fragrance, though pleasant, is a bit strong. There wasn't really a noticeable difference in the overall appearance of the skin such as becoming firmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The moisturizer feels decadent and is perfect for skin that is dealing with the transition from summer to fall. I have oily skin and sometimes moisturizers with sunscreen can be heavy, but this one I'd perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this on my in the mornings for about a week. It is very light and I don't think as moisturizing as I need. But I do love the fact that it is SPF 20. I really think I will set this aside for spring and summer. It is light enough that I think on hot sunny days it will just be what my face and neck need! As the weather gets cooler a heavier cream is needed. At least for me. I love the fact that these products a light on scent and work together so well!

"I've enjoyed the great coverage of the L'OrealFacial Day Lotion, now in different climates. I was going amazed that this product didn't feel like it was melting off in hot and humid weather, but now during the colder winter winds battering my skin, it provides great coverage and protection with the SPF 20.

"I have been using the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion for a few weeks now and I have grown to really like it. I am using it with the serum and at first I found it took some time to get the lotion to completely absorb into my skin. After some trial and error I found that I was using to much lotion, a little really does go a long way. Now I use just a few drops and get great absorption and just love the smoothing of my fine lines that I am now seeing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleasantly surprised with the facial day lotion with the spf 20 it was light weight and did not lave my face feeling greasy and - I spent quite of bit of time outside when using the product and I was please to see the wind didn't dry my skin out and I never got either a sun not wind burn which is exceptional - not much of a strong smell to it would highly recommend it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I had only used the L'Oreal Paris Lotion Moisturizer with a broad spectrum SPF 20 only twice. Both times I used this product I was doing light yard work. It is fall here where I live.

"I loved the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Triple power facial day lotion, because it made my face smooth, soft and had a plumping effect. I still continue to use it, and will continue because I think it works well. It also has SPF 20 which is good for my skin. It does not interfere with my foundation either. Thumbs up!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This lotion is super thick so a little goes a long way. It is super moisterizing but the SPF breaks out so I really dont wear it unless I know I'm going to be out in the sun all day. The smels is okay it has glitter in it which I'm not too crazy about but it dosent mess with my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the serum and moisturizer much better. I'm thinking that perhaps this 3rd layer was just too much for my skin. I'm going to try alternating the SPF with the Facial moisturizer. but honestly, I make my own sunscreen, so this is probably something that I won't re-buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I normally like L'Oreal products and I have tried the lotions before period I didn't really care for the design of this bottle. The top seemed a little too squat hard to get the lotion out. I didn't care for the fact that I had to put on a third location for the sun Factor. In addition I did not care for the smell of these products. All the lotions seemed heavy to me an extremely thick. I didn't notice much of a difference in my facial wrinkles or moisture [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is a fabulous daytime moisturizer. It goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. There is no greasy residue. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and protected. The scent is faint and pleasant. There isn't an overpowering sunscreen smell like I've noticed in other daytime moisturizers. This is my new everyday essential. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The L'Oreal Sunscreen/Face Lotion is amazing if you live in a state with a lot of sun. I live in Florida and this has become an essential for me. It soothes your face and immediately feels moisturized. I have dry skin and this has been working perfectly! It has refirmed contours and made my blemishes disappear. The texture of the cream is non-greasy and feels almost silky. It applies well and absorbs nicely onto the skin. I will definitly be trying this product again.

I have been using this lotion daily for a few weeks now and have really noticed a difference in the look and texture of my skin. The lotion goes on easily and does not leave a greasy feeling at all.

"This product has helped me out tremendously. The L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Facial Day Cream has really worked wonderfully for me. I work outside for 12 hours a day. My skin gets, burnt, chapped, dirty, and just generally dried out. The sunscreen in this cream stopped my cheeks from getting so red and helped keep some moisture in without being too heavy.

"I usually use a different brand for my face lotion. When I got this campaign, I thought it would be good to switch and see if I liked this one better. I liked that this one didn't make my skin feel slick. I felt like I could feel the change in the tightness of the skin. Using it daily wasn't an issue because I was already in the habit. I would recommend it to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been on the hunt to find a moisturizer that has spf, keeps my skin clear and hydrated and most importantly, doesn't make my foundation cakey. This day lotion meets all of these!

"This daytime moisturizer is just right for my combination skin. I break out easily, have an oily t zone and some dry patches. This moisturizer is a great balance, not too heavy for under makeup, yet moisturizing enough to combat any dry areas! It also has the added benefit of SPF. I highly recommend this product!

"The Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion Moisturizer offered the same texture improvement as the other products in the Revitalift line but also had the added benefit of SPF protection!

"This Facial Day Lotion is non-greasy, reduces fine lines/wrinkles and provides sun protection... what more could you want??

"Over the years I have tried various facial lotions trying to find the one that makes me look as good as I feel and I do believe that L'Oréal Paris has done the trick with their RevitaLift Triple Power Facial lotion.

"I love the SPF Lotion! It goes on smooth, lasts all day, and doesn't smell ""funny"" or ""off"" like so many SPF products I've used in the past! Say goodbye to racoon eyes and hello to evenly toned skin again! Product also doesn't feel slimy on your skin, which is a huge step up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this product a lot! It is a thin layer that has huge protection for your face. It smells good, not like regular sunscreen which is really important for me. I can't tell if it ""works"" for the sun, but it has helped moisturize my face and it has also made my face less oily throughout the day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't know if I had enough time to use it, but I didn't like putting this on as a 3rd layer in the mornings. I also am not a fan of something that should be used daily that acts like a sunscreen, which is what this seemed like it was. This doesn't allow for absorption of important vitamins and color. It was a little hard to rub in and you had to use sparingly. There were already 2 more greasy layers underneath. I did not notice any changes to my skin, personally. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was surprised at how light it was! I have combination skin so I worried about using it everywhere on my face. But it turned out to be great! I really need a product with SPF, too, so that was an added bonus. It didn't make my face shiny or greasy either. It absorbs very quickly if you want to apply a foundation.

I really loved this Day Lotion. It was fragrant and went on really well on my skin. It feels more nourishing than some of the other SPF creams that I have tried. It seemed to really combine both the protective SPF part as well as hydrate like a facial lotion. I would highly recommend this product to others and have already done so with friends.

I think overall this product and the whole product line is great for consumers who are looking for anti aging products on a budget. I am a woman in my thirties with oily acne prone skin.

"I love when my moisturizer has SPF included. One less step in my routine makes me happy! The pump dispenses just the right amount for one application, this is nice because you are not wasting product. I didn't find any of their claims (repair wrinkles, redensify or refirm) to be true for me but the moisturizer is great to keep my skin moist & soft without flaking or leaving a film on my face. It also didn't interact with my foundation which is a huge plus to me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this day lotion. It has a nice light scent and a lovely creamy texture that is quickly absorbed completely by my skin. I love that the SPF is 20. The pump container seems to dispense just the right amount and my skin feels very hydrated without feeling tacky. I don't have that heavy feeling or tight feeling I have noticed in lotions with higher SPF. This lotion also works fine under foundation and doesn't give you a greasy look after a few hours.

"I really love the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20. It is very moisturizing, but also light enough to not make my face so greasy I can't wear makeup. I have started to notice a little improvements in my fine lines since using the system. It works really well together, and I am really enjoying the line. Every product has a nice light scent and my skin feels great after I put it on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is awesome, you can tell they did their homework! I put on the serum first, and then the deep-acting facial moisturizer, and then I top it off with the facial day lotion SPF. It is light, a soft smell, and it is protecting my face from the sun!! I will keep buying for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal Facial Day Lotion was great. It;s scent was nice and it felt very lightweight. It combines SPF 20 with with wrinkle reducing. What's not to like. I recommend this product and would purchase it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This facial day lotion with SPF 20 is great! It is easily applied and evenly covers. Leaves your face feeling hydrated not sticky. My face perspires a lot and it does not become tacky or feel like it wipes off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is going to become my favorite day time moisturizer. Living in Arizona with our dry air my skin looses so much moisture every day. This moisturizer maintained the moisture on my face throughout the day until my nighttime cleansing and moisturizing routine. I would highly recommend this product to all of my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been trying this moisturizer for a few weeks and I love it. A little goes a long way and it does not feel greasy. It goes on very smooth and feels very light. My skin feels softer more radiant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 as a light daytime moisturizer as it is marketed. I really do favor a moisturizer like the deep acting facial moisturizer because I have very dry skin but if you were someone who preferred a lighter moisturizer over a thick one or wanted one to wear under makeup and had SPF I could see you really liking this. I would absolutely recommend this to a friend of that skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have again rated this product 5 stars. The day lotion made my skin feel protected and softened when I was out in the sun and wind. I am a farm wife who is often out in the weather. The product went on smooth and felt so good. It was not greasy and my skin just felt hydrated. The wrinkles I believe have become less noticeable. I really love this product and would recommend it to anyone looking for total protection and repair of your facial area. It is a great product that works [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I work at a daycare, and am constantly sweating. This product felt great on my skin, and kept me fully protected with special 20 which is more than enough spf in the fall. This product also has a floral scent which I really like, and this product felt great under makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a great light moisturizer. I live that bit has spf and I mk now it will be great for summer time because I don't wear foundation and often forget sunscreen. I have made the three products part of a daily routine. Great. for moms on the go to behave protection gains tax sun damage nwithiut having to take the time to apply separate sunscreen.

"This product is great for entire body, not just your face. I used it on my hands and it gave them a great smooth feeling without feeling oily or thick with lotion. I definitely recommend this to anyone needing to fight away dark spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only used this product a couple of times. When I did use it, though, I noticed my skin was not as sensitive to the sun. Yeah! no more red, blotchy patches on my face when I go outside! A new fave! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This sunscreen lotion is great I have oily skin and usually I get breakouts from the SPF but not this one. My skin feels smooth without getting oily throughout the day, this is my favorite day lotion with SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't like the smell of the product. It wasn't a bad smell but had a hint of a scent I didn't care for. I also felt it was a little greasy feeling and left my face feeling slightly sticky the rest of the day. I typically don't wear any makeup, so face powder may have eliminated that. It just wasn't a product for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this in the morning time & wore it alone & sometimes under my makeup. It is a amazing product. Makes skin feel very smooth. After about a week, could notice skin was tighter and less wrinkles. When wore under makeup, it made makeup look more flawless. Even when wore alone you could tell a difference. Also help correct color flaws. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion Moisturizer isn't as effective as claimed. I tried this product for 14 days with no change in dark spots. Use as a mild sunscreen and light moisture would be the best use of this product. Although very fragrant it becomes less noticeable within several minutes. I can not testify for its effectiveness on discoloration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oréal Paris revitalift triple action works wonders. I've never tried a product that works as well and as quick as this product. I began to see results in just 5 days. My skin looks more youthful and glowing since I've incorporated this product in my skin care regime. I highly suggest you give it a chance. You won't be disappointed. It has made my skin look so youthful and vibrant that I've been getting countless compliments. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I wasn't as impressed with the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 as I thought I would be. It felt thick and slimy on my skin, even though I only used a small amount. It ran in my eyes and made them burn. Once it soaked in a little and I applied my makeup, it wasn't that bad. I love the other RevitaLift products, but would not recommend this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can't wait to tell my family and friends about this gem! My skin is dry and during cold weather it becomes worse. This moisturizer works really great! I applied it every morning for 3 weeks and my skin feels wonderful. It's lightweight, non greasy with a great scent. The spf is an added bonus to make this moisturizer a win for me. I will definitely will reccomend this product! #bzzagent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After trying the other products I have to say I am really disappointed in the facial day lotion. I did not like the texture as it was not very smooth and left an unpleasant residue. Also the smell of the product was not very appealing. I would expect to feel glamorous using this product however it was quite the opposite. After using it for several weeks I was relieved to stop using it. The product also resulted in my skin breaking out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After almost 2 weeks of using all 3 products ,morning routine and evening routine.. my skin overall feels more taught and much more hydrated! No difference in the lines around my eyes but I do see a bit of a difference in overall appearance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the Day lotion moisturizer, since I am outside more of the time I have to be protected with a good sunscreen, I use this at last and I love it. Has a good spf 20, my skin has a some discoloration but since I am been used it I looks more better. Love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When using this I noticed my face did not dry out. It was not greasy like most. The most important thing I loved is that it protected my face at such a low SPF, I had NO sunburns at all. Will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I have to start by saying that I quit using moisturizer years ago because of the sticky/oily factor. I'm pleased to say that this product does NOT make my skin feel sticky or oily. It DOES make it feel smooth and happy knowing I am protecting myself from harmful UV rays. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer was just ok. I didn't notice any special results. This is for daytime use and to be used after the serum. Like most good moisturizers, my make up went on smoothly. It's best that wait 5 minutes after applying the moisturizer to allow it to dry and then put on your foundation. I have chocolate colored skin so I really had to rub this moisturizer in for it to disappear, that just seemed to be too much work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is great!! Does its job and what it says it's going to do non greasy and smells good however I did find that my makeup clumps when I use this first . Maybe it's my poor choice of makeup [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the smell of this product. It feels gentle on my skin, not harsh like some sun protection. I like the amount that the pump provides and the locking feature on the pump - since it is usually in my gym bag and I don't have unwanted product on my sneakers, so there is more for my face and neck. Thanks L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using all three products I can honestly say that I can see a huge difference in the softness and the over all firmness of my face!! At the jaw line and neck area there had been some signs of sagging.... Not anymore.... I did notice that if you did not follow the institutions on applying the lotion and you were active you did have minor issues with wetness.... However if used properly the products will very well. Satisfied with the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"If you're looking for a good Everyday lotion with some SPF then you will like this product. It is very sheer and light weight on the skin. A little goes a long way. It does have a slight greasy, velvety feeling when you apply it, but once absorbed into the skin, it feels great. It has a light clean scent and is very hydrating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Like all the products in this line, you need just the smallest amount to have extremely moisturized and soft skin. I use this after cleansing and before applying makeup. It absorbs quickly. I love that it has SPF 20. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Was outdoors a lot this weekend enjoying the crisp weather. Used L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20. So much better than sunscreen and complimented the other L'Oreal products I use quite well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My favorite thing about these products is the smoothness of my skin! It leaves your skin feeling so soft and smooth. I have a few dark spots on my skin and these products have lighten them significantly! Definitely recommend these products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was glad to finally find a lotion that I can use daily that doesn't feel oily. L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 is something I have found that after having cancer, this is something that really works, my skin is soft, not oily, has great coverage and I don't worry about burning. I can wear it under my makeup or if I don't feel like wearing makeup. I have that confidence that I am covered. Love this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loreal Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion is very lightweight, yet very moisturizing. After continued use, I feel that my skin looks smoother and looks brighter. I also noticed my dark spots have lightened! I love that it have an SPF in it;however, I would love this even more if the SPF was higher! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought this was a decent lotion, I don't think I will use it as my daily facial moisturizer. I will probably save this lotion for sunny days due to the spf. I think I would prefer using the deep acting facial moisturizer for a daily face lotion over the spf lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was looking for a new line of products to use as I was using another line. When I tried L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 , I LOVED it!! My skin feels pampered while using it and it is very rich and a great moisturizer. I'm always concerned about oiliness in my skin and so far, so good. No problems! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is absolutely amazing! I noticed the fine lines and wrinkles starting to disappear after the first week of use. This product made my skin feel silky smooth and was not at all greasy. The added bonus is the SPF. I love the sun and never think to apply SPG to my eye area. This product does it all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the day lotion is absolutely amazing it is super smooth going on and leaves my face feeling silky smooth. I have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin at all.

I thought L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 (1.7 oz) worked great as sun protection and skin nourishment. I was very pleased by how moisturizing and effective the sun protection was. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love that this has SPF 20,to protect my skin. It is as described, very lightweight on my face. It soaks right in and leaves no residue. It wears very well under my makeup. My only drawback it that it is strongly scented. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I believe in these Loreal Paris RevitaLift products! I have been using the RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion. After a week I noticed my skin was much smoother, my age spots have gotten lighter, and my skin tone is evening out all over. I would definitely buy this product. Who couldn't use more beautiful skin! Thank you so much BuzzAgent, and Loreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have always used daily moisturizers with sunscreen in them, and this one is one of the best I've tried! I loved the smell, and the way it made my face feel. It was a little heavier than others I've tried, but still light enough that I will continue to use it. The last thing I want is to have a greasy face when I'm not wearing makeup, and this product did not disappoint! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
In using L'Oriel Revitalift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion it is the lightest of all the system. In using it it makes your face feel smooth and you don't realize it is on when used by itself. There may be need for a higher spf if that is your concern but a face lotion that includes it is a plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF works as a dual facial product....a natural moisturizer & a sun screen. It Is very lightweight, goes on smooth & soft, & gives my skin a fresh & natural feeling....hoping to see a reduction in dark spots after more use. I don't use sun screen continually, but with the ease of appliance & benefits, I will continue to use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I replaced my daily lotion with this and I was very pleased. It is smooth and silky. Just be aware, a little goes a long way! It doesn't leave a residue like some lotions and my makeup applied over it well. I found the biggest impact was the moisture pay off and the decreased spots! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved using this lotion. It was really lightweight and sunk in quickly. It was a nice addition to my morning routine. I love to keep it short and sweet in the skincare department in the morning, and this lotion worked as an SPF and moisturizer which really helped cut down my routine. The matching serum and moisturizer was great for night time. Highly recommend this lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Sunscreen is really important to me, so I liked that this moisturizer for day has a built in SPF. SPF 20 is decent, but I would have liked it even more if it was a higher SPF, like a 30 or 50. Really wanted to like this product since I love the other items in this Loreal collection, but this SPF moisturizer is great on it's own, but if you plan to add foundation on top I found it to be too sticky and started to make my foundation pill on top, so I was disappointed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 is exactly what my aging skin needed for everyday use. Leaves my skin feeling protected from the sun, reduced wrinkles and younger looking. Highly recommend for younger looking skin. Covers all the things needed in a concentrated serum treatment (Triple Power) for your aging skin. Feeling pampered, happy and beautiful. Thank you L'Oreal.

"I think L'Oreal has done it again with this daily lotion moisturizer. Not only did it repair my wrinkles, it also worked on a couple of areas that were discolored on my face. This product, much like the deep acting facial moisturizer, went on smoothly, was non-greasy, and moisturized well. I use this product every morning as part of my morning ritual as it is very light weight. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Prior to trying L'Oreal RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 I wore a drug store brand lotion with only SPF 10. I have been using RevitaLift for about 2.5 weeks now and I love it. It goes on smooth and ight and dries quickly so I can put my makeup right on without waiting. I also love that I have doubled my SPF protection, something that is important as I get older. I often wear it without makeup and leave the house feeling like my skin looks great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wasn't sure how I'd feel about This product as my skin tends to be sensitive tonocwr the counter products. I found the product to be not too heavy and concentrated. It doesn't break my face out like most products can. Has a pleasant smell which is not too overpowering or perfumey. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love the bottle color and ease of use. One pump is all you need to cover your face. Fast absorbing, non greasy and lightweight. Left my skin feeling soft and smooth. Very light clean smelling fragrance, not over powering at all. Used over the facial serum treatment. Did not feel gunky or heavy. Nice product and will continue to use once I run out.

I absolutely love the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20. It is not greasy at all. Keeps my skin soft and smooth. I really like this Day Lotion especially that fact that its spf20. It smells so good. Not a strong scent. I use it before i apply my make-up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The reason I gave it a 4 and not a 5 is that I usually buy unscented beauty products. I just have a sensitivity to the different smells - some give me a headache, others just make me downright ill!! I believe that L'Oreal is a great product, I just can't use it because of the smell. However, I have given it to my Mother-in-law, and she is excitedly trying it. In her opinion, all three products work great!! By the way, she Loves the smell - haha!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF20 is a dream product. I spend a lot of time outside in the sun so i was happy to find this product that not only moisturize but has that added protection.

"I have an oily face, so I am hesitant on trying new products on my face. I went out and purchased the cream face wash so I could get the full effect of this product. O-M-G!!!! The combination of the face wash and face day lotion helps keep my face oil-free, and there is a difference in appearance on my skin. My skin is a little brighter and more even.

"I don't always wear makeup out. I love it but I always get short of time so when I have to leave the house with no makeup, I need a very good moisturizer that will also protect me from the sun. I was happy to see that with my regular and original routine, this day wear lotion is definitely a favorite. I can wear this alone without anything over it and still feel vibrant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Been using the day lotion every day for about 10 or so days now and I love it! The scent is light; the lotion comes infused with SPF, something I often overlook; more importantly, it's moisturizing without the oily residue which other creams leave causing my pores to clog. Definitely worth trying esp if have large pores, norm to oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the L'Oreal Revitalift triple power lotion moisturizer about 3 weeks, and works excellent. Since the first week I could see my skin hydrated and softer, and now in the third week I have seen a evident reduction in coarse lines of course with the use of the 3 combined products , serum and deep acting moisturize too. I would prefer a softer perfum in the product, but my housband love it The texture is good. And the product works good for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Though I have dry skin and use the deep acting moisturizer at night for extra nourishing, I love to use this one during the day. My skin soaks it up quite fast, it does not leave the skin greasy or oily. After using it for a while now, I noticed my skin feels better, healthier and so soft and smooth. I do use the serum of this series first, and then the lotion. I feel I am doing something really great for my skin and face. I feel prettier because my skin in my face looks better.

"Living in Florida, face cream with any SPF is essential. I was happy to see that the L'Oreal revitalift triple power facial day lotion had an SPF of 20. I've been using it daily for the last 3 weeks and I'm very happy with my results. I apply it after the serum and before leaving the house. My skin felt hydrated and smooth. It wasn't greasy like most other lotions. Who knew protecting my skin could feel so good. I'm not thrilled with the scent of it but not enough to stop using it.

Though this product was very heavy n left a strange film I loved the fresh clean scent of it. If could make less heavy n filmy I would try longer. My skin is very sensitive and had no reactions to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love it! I used this on the days when my skin was not as dry. It left a tingly feeling for hours letting me know that it was doing it's thing! This is also good protection while outside on those sunny days [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product that you are supposed to use with others in the line takes too much time to apply, it makes your face feel thick and loaded with product. I did not see a difference in my skin. Also if you plan on being active and sweating this product burns and runs off into your eyes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am such a huge fan of L'oreal skincare products and was excited to try this line which I've always had my eyes on. This product smells lovely, glides on to your skin and doesn't leave it greasy or oily. Perfect base for your makeup and contains SPF which is hard to find in a good moisturizer (spf with no oilies) I haven't been using this long enough to notice any significant difference in my skin but my face looks brighter and more polished. Would definitely keep using this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is a delight to use. My skin feels soft and replenished all day. I was hesitant about it, but after my first use I am hooked. My skin is looking fabulous and it feels really good to be on the right track for healthier looking skin. This product is easy to use, and you get alot in the jar. I am impressed with the product and it's definitely part of my morning routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bzz'd about the product to a group of friends by taking the Lotion and asking them to give me their thoughts. People loved the lightness of a Day Lotion. They also appreciated that it had a SPF of 20 because their foundations usually dont have more than a SPF 15. My friends liked that it was not greasy. We are only giving it 4 stars because we are not sure if it really does take care of wrinkles or spots as they only used it once. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
From sun goddess to vampire status I am of the age I want products that contain SPF. This day lotion worked amazingly well under my foundation. Past products have only made my makeup melt off my face because my face was overlying moist. Using this lotion with the other 2 L'Ore al products has changed the look and feel of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While the fragrance is nice, it is very overpowering. Within minutes of applying, I had to wash my face... twice... and the scent still lingered in my nose. The positive, my skin did feel softer after washing it off. I will pass these products on to someone who may be less sensitive to the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this product as part of my daily regimen. Although I feel it is not as concentrated as a serum or moisturizer it was nice to complement both and to help with protecting my skin from the damaging rays. I would recommend it to those whom do outside activities or work in the damaging rays. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First off, the scent is AMAZING! Nothing worse then using products that smell of anything less than pleasant. But never fear, this stuff smells like a million bucks. On top of that, aside from it being super light-weight, it easily absorbs and provides my skin with the moisture it needs all day! My makeup goes smoothly on top of it and does not create an oil slick. I can't say enough good things about this stuff and can't wait to try out more of the line.

"This L'oreal Day Lotion is very lightweight and non greasy. It goes on smooth and feels very luxurious. You don't need a lot as it covers great. It has some SPF, but not too much which I think is enough for days I'm not out in the sun long. It has not affected my make-up application afterwords. I have dryish skin as thew weather gets colder and this has been keeping it moisturized without feeling like it. A great balance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wanted to give this day lotion some time before I replied again about it. I love how the lotion absorbs I to my skin. It is not greasy and makes my face and neck feel very very soft. Using all three of these products has made a difference in not just the feel of my skin but the appearance. These lotions from l'oreal Paris can make a difference in my skin.

"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 smells great, and goes on smoothly, isn't greasy. I use this every morning and especially like the sun protection because I live in a sunny state. My skin looks better, it semms to be getting rid of my fine lines and there is no sheen. I would recommend this to my best friend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I do enjoy that daily moisturizer is lightweight and contains a nice 20 spf. I don't enjoy the overpowering scent of this, and that it makes my skin feel hot for the first couple of hours that I have it on. Due to the latter, I will not continue using this product.

"This light day lotion is EXACTLY what my face needed. The Texas sun is BRUTAL! Even in Late October/Early November, it was still 75-80 degrees with full sun. I normally dont even consider wearing SPF anything on my face in my day to day life (unless Im on the beach). But as Ive gotten older, I started to realize how important it is. The Day Lotion is light but with just enough moisture to feel hydrated. LOVE IT! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This has the same triple power ingredient as their serum and moisturizer. I used this a few times only mainly because I live in Hawai‘i, and I need a little more than sun protection than spf 20. It's a light formulation and apply and absorbs easy. For those who lives in less sunny places, this would be a great daily spf. It doesn't produce a white cast. It allows subsequent application of makeup easy, with out being thick or dry. A great product overall if I didn't live on a sunny island! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that this is a great product that helps with my dry skin. With the winter coming and the cooler weather, I feel like my face is getting drier and drier, but when I used this moisturizer, my face felt so smooth and not greasy. It stayed on all day and really helped my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am typically very particular about which sunscreen products I use on my face, because my skin is prone to breakouts and most products make my face feel greasy.

I've only had the product for a week but so far I'm really happy with it. The lotion isn't too heavy and spreads easily. I have sensitive skin and I haven't had any issues with it. I love the SPF 20! My biggest complaint with day lotions is if they don't have SPF included. I will definitely purchase this product once my sample is finished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was chosen to try L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 . This Product is great! Took about a week for my skin to really start showing the effects. only takes a small amount in the morning after i wash my face. My face is now clearly more soft and dewy. I have normally combo/oily skin and it didnt make my skin shiny or breakout! ill continue to use this moisturizer for quite some time! Im very happy and have told quite a few friends [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a smooth and easy to apply lotion. I put my under eye concealer on directly after applying but I wait several minutes before applying the rest of my makeup. I have not noticed it interfering with makeup application the way some SPF lotions do. It is a little thicker then I normally desire, but I attribute that to being highly hydrating and chalked full of SPF. It would be interesting to try this day lotion without the SPF for winter gray days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After two weeks using L'Oreal's REvitLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 I can say that it is an OK cream with not much added benefit besides the sun protection. The cream is dispensed in pump form but unlike it's sister products the formula is too think for my liking. It doesn't glide as smoothly as the other creams in the line, nor is it as moisturizing. I would say take it or leave it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a greasy skin type and when it comes to use face creams with sunscreens, it is very hard for me to find one that does not make my face looks shiny. Unfortunately, this lotion was not the exception. I tried it above the serum and alone and in both occasions it feels a little heavy and make my face shinny. This is my very personal case, maybe if you have a normal skin type it works very well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this moisturizer for 2 weeks now. I put it on in the morning and my skin feels very soft and looks amazing. I have been using hardly any makeup now due to this wonderful moisturizer. My skin has been completely protected from the sun! I absolutely love this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was hoping for a nice, rich moisturizer that would fill in my fine lines. This smells nice however the texture is very watery and slippery. When I first applied it, it feels almost oily which is not what I like. After five minutes, my face felt like I never put moisturizer on my face. I think there is other products out there that will help more with the fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm very happy with all of the L'Oréal products that I have received, the L'Oréal Paris Rivital lift triple power facial lotion, serum treatment, and moisturizer, it smooths and softens and makes me feel younger looking, and it really must work cause people call me Mom to my grandkids , thanks L'Oréal Paris.

Had a bad case of dry skin in the T area of the forehead and nose and after applying this product for a week that area has changed dramatically. It is now softer and smoother and has a healthy look to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product is amazing. I have used this product every morning and unlike most products with SPF in them it goes on light and leaves no heavy oily feeling. I also have noticed that a red splotch, by my eye, that I am accustomed to is not as notice able. It worked for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using the serum I use this lotion in the morning and with very little you can moisturizer you're skin wonderfully. This line of skin care is comparable to high end lines of skin care for a fraction of the cost. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Let me start by saying, I am a black woman. My skin color alone helps me reduce the chances of sun damage on my skin. I have always used a moisturizer with SPF protection just to be safe. I will say, that I love the smell and feel of this product. I also LOVE the fact that it absorbs quickly and leaves no residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was really hoping this would work as stated by the instructions and description, but within at least 20 minutes my neck completely broke out with hives or the like. My neck became completely irritated, itchy, and red in color. None of the other items from this campaign made me have any adverse reactions, but this one. The only thing I can think of the difference is the sunscreen added in this one. Sunscreen isn't in the others that I know of. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Well I am loving this serum! It feels very thick but disappears from your skin the moment you apply it leaving your skin not greasy at all. It has a strong smell but it's not overpowering, the bottle is very elegant and the pump dispenser is great as you can control the amount you apply. I usually do 1 pump for my face and 1 for my neck. I have received complements after using this for a couple of weeks and I can use less make up, highly recommend this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i think this a great lotion to use everyday.summer winter spring and fall.they say sunscreen is so important.I hate using a separate sunscreen. I love that this great lotion has it already in it. it goes on so smoothly and makes my makeup look better. i also use the serum under the moisturizer and it does not feel heavy at all.I would and have oldie family and friends about these products. some of them already use them.But others are going to buy them. Way to go Loreal.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The moisturizer is great for dry skin. It's light to wear and good with makeup. I used it for almost two weeks, but my skin become itchy and red. My skin is very sensitive and it's difficult finding a skincare line that works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this moisturizer for a week now. I liked how smooth it left my face after I applied it. Did not need no other moisturizer for my face. Cleared up my dry skin around my T zone of my face. The small fragrance just add to the moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using these products twice a day for 2 weeks and they are great. Lightly scented and not greasy at all. I have seen a difference in the texture of my skin, especially around my eyes. I will definitely continue to use and recommend them all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While this creamy lotion is light enough for day use, it leaves skin soft all day. PLUS the sunscreen we all forget to use on a daily basis is already included!! THIS is helping me fight future wrinkles! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this stuff! Light enough to wear under makeup. I wear this and the serum daily. My fe has stayed moisturized nnd fresh feeling since u started it. I honestly can't tell that !y face is any tighter or less wrinkled but it has stayed hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm on the fence with this one. I like a soft light feel. This was almost closer to being too heavy. I like the fragrance of it. After it was on a while it was soft but jit st not sure I can tolerate it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the Facial Day Lotion for over a week now and I can't believe how great my skin feels! I have been outside 8 hours day for work and I haven't had any problems with wind burn like I usually would. I am soo happy to have found something that protects my face, smells good and feels great! I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great sunscreen-lotion. Also works as a primer (in my opinion). My makeup looks exactly the same from 0530-1730! No primer needed, which now will save me money on a primer or foundation! I just now have to use powder! The sunscreen pay also saves me another step, is almost like 3-in-1 for me! I'll definitely continue using all of these products! Thank you foot creating these amazing creams & syrums! The best yet!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think L'Oreal Paris RefitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 is a wonderful product to have in your bathroom closet. It made my skin feel so soft and smooth. The smell is just right not to strong. Helped reduce wrinkles not as noticeable. I would recommend L'Oreal to any of my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 is a good solid Daytime lotion for smoothing wrinkles and brightening your face. Along with the Serum in this line, it is a little powerhouse. A little goes a long way and it does take some time to soak in. I found my daytime face looked smoother and brighter using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So I put this day lotion over the serum on my face and this, too, smells amazing. Not only does it feel light and refreshing on my face, this has sunscreen in it so I feel it is protecting my face from the sun. This is a truly wonderful and affordable day lotion for your face and the bonus is it has sunscreen! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As more and more people are diagnosed with skin cancer (my mother included) I wanted to find a product that would protect my face from the harmful UV rays from a company I trust while at the same time slowing down the aging process. This product is an easy way to accomplish that task. I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I can't say enough about it. I will continue to use it for a long time.

"While enjoying the Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion, I have also used it with the Revitalift Serum and Deep acting Moisturizer. The lotion is very creamy and luxurious. My facial, neck and even hands drink the it right up and I instantly feel like I have spoiled myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The lotion went on smooth and not oily like others thus can be worn all day with comfort. Wearing a SPF 20 lotion each day such as L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion will protect your skin from those harmful sun rays. This is a great buy for a woman on the go a quick rub and you are off. It didn't dry on my skin either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used l'oreal Paris revitalize triple power facial day lotion for a week. While I feel with the other two lotions that these products work as advertised in reducing visible wrinkles. It really clogged my pores and caused me to break out. I would not buy this product. I would rather have a couple wrinkles other than a breakout. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 is the cherry on top of completing my daily facial regimen. It goes on smoothly and is absorbed quickly. A little dab will do you and I'm off to a great start to my sunny day with SPF 20 skin protection. L'Oreal Paris ... you've done it again. Perfection!!

The product smells great and absorbs nicely in my skin. It is non greasy which is a big plus for me. It was easy to use and the instructions are very clear. I like all Loreal products. My skin is already looking healthier. Its light weight and absorbed nicely in my skin. Its great that it helps protect my skin from the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I followed the directions to use the Triple Power Facial Day lotion after the concentrated facial serum and am thrilled with the results. It only takes a small amount of the product and my face is smoother and softer after only 3 days of using the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A tiny bit goes so far! And it's so smooth and creamy! I love it! I usually am not into lotions per say. But this is just amazing. I've been I using it for about a week and I am very impressed. Great product and at a really affordable price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the feel of this facial lotion. It goes on smooth and is a very lightweight lotion But yet leaves your skin feeling super moisturized and hydrated. It's spf is 20 but doesn't leave any residue or color of any kind. This lotions only down fall I would say is it moisturizes so well I can only Use it about every other day or I break out in a zit.

"Wow, what a great day time facial moisturizing lotion. I've been using it daily for two weeks and my skin feels great. It is just the right amount of creamy and smooths on my face easily. It protects from the sun with an SPF of 20. It's not heavy or thick and my bronzer looks wonderful over it. It's helped nourish my skin and bring a nice brightness to my skin tone.

This product left my skin smooth and soft but I did not like that I felt a layer on my skin that I could scrape off. I will continue to use it to see if it will reduce dark spots. I tend to like the Triple Power Deep-acting Mosturizer better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the bottle and the great deep red. I love that a little goes a long way. This product is light and the lotion melts into your skin. My skin feels and looks hydrant. I love the glow it gives my skin and the spf 20 is great. This product really delivers beautiful skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I usually don't wear make-up which leaves my face unprotected. L'Oreal's RevitaLift Facial Day lotion SPF 20 not only moisturizers my face, it also protects my face from the sun. My face feels soft to the touch, it isn't greasy, and it didn't make my skin break out either. The scent is a little strong, but it is a pleasant smell. I'm so glad I tried this. Since having it, I don't leave home until I put it on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Since I really never used a ""day"" lotion,I was excited to see the effects on my skin, and I very happy to report, this is a daily ritual that has paid off, I highly recommend anything that gives me complementary second looks, Thanks L'Oréal ❣️❣️❣️❣️ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After applying this product more than once my face broke out in itchy welps each time. Guess I am highly allergic to something in this product. Thank you so much for letting me try the product. I am giving it to my mother to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this product for over a week and I'm loving it! My face always feels smooth and hydrated after using the lotion and never dried out! I love the smell it has and I love the fact it has a SPF in it! I will defiantly be continuing to use these facial products!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As I have gotten older, the spot in between my eyebrows has become very dry. I have used several things to try to get that to go away. I even tried to use coconut oil but that made the skin around it shine. It wasn't until I used this for about a week and it actually got it to decrease the dry spot. I am still using it so we will see if it completely removes it. Fingers crossed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Like the light feel of the lotion; leaves the skin moist and fresh feeling. Nice fragrance, not oily and absorbs into skin very well. Will continue using it to give it a good trial. Will definitely consider changing to this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I decided to try the Day Lotion because I have discoloration in my skin and dark spots as you can see in the picture. I love the lightness of the product. That it goes on smoothly and that its not greasy at all. I love that it has a SPF of 20 (you dont find that in a lot of moisturizers) but nothing has happened to my skin spots. I would use this product as a sunscreen under my foundation but that is about all it has done for my skin. I will keep trying it, maybe it needs more time.

Been using this revitalift day lotion for about 2 weeks now and a little bit goes a long way I apply it before I apply my makeup and I have a few dark splotches on my face that the lotion is actually lightened and I'm very happy with the results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Like I said in other reviews these products make my face super soft and great looking. Since I have fair skin I love the fact that this facial day lotion has a spf of 20 I can just put it on and not worry about my face so much when I go out for daily errands and stuff. This stuff is thick like sunscreen but has a light pleasant smell so a little goes a long way. It's a great everyday lotion when used with the other products. Would recommend to others.

The L'Oréal day spf 20 lotion is good especially going out into the sun. It keeps my face moisturizer and looking good. I seen a difference on how it keeps my face replenished with moisture. This is great for anyone to try especially if you don't like using anything that is oily and heavy. This does work so try it out!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the lotion for the last week or so and I like the fact that it has spf 20. It feels great when applying, no greasy feeling. I use the facial serum treatment too and I have to say: let it absorb for a couple minutes before applying the lotion or it will feel heavy on the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20. A very little goes a very long way, feels heavy and greasy on the hands and face when applied. Leaves the skin looking a bit oily but then later on seems to absorb oil from the face and leave more of a matte finish. I don't generally use moisturizers with SPF in them, you could notice the smell of the SPF right away but it went away and didn't leave a long lasting heavy feel on the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the lotion. The consistency is good and absorbs quickly. I love that there is SPF 20 as opposed to 15. It's not greasy which is great. I used it mostly in the morning and mid afternoon when I take walks outside under the sun. It definitely moisturizes my skin and prevents any dryness especially during the winter season. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I began using RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion as a substitute for my foundations on days I am on the go and do not have time to do my makeup. I was really happy to know that it protects my skin such as my foundation that contains the same spf 20. I felt my face really soft and does not look dull but most of all I love that my face does not become over oily which is the fear I have when it comes to any lotion. I absolutely love!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This sunscreen goes on so light and easy. I didn't even feel like I was wearing a sunscreen and the fact that it will work on my fine lines while keeping the UV rays off my face bonus!! My mom works for a dermatologist and she is always telling me I need to wear sunscreen on my face now I can tell her I found a sunscreen that I will use forever.

Well I thought the product smelled great felt a slight tingle when I started to smooth it over my skin has a nice silky texture not greasie like some lotions can have I think we should of been given more time to text this product to see if it truely stands up to what they claim it does just my Opinion thank you for the chance again to sample this new beauty product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I often tell younger girls that they need to protect their skin from the sun through out the year. This product is perfect as it is a light moisturizer with sunblock in it so they do not feel like they are putting on sunscreen in the middle of the fall and the winter but they are still getting protected. It smells great and feels nice and smooth on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a light weight moisturizer, but don't let that fool you. i am impressed by it containing 3 different sunscreen ingredients to protect. It refreshed my skin when used and felt soft. Tightest disappeared. Still using to see if my dark spots and discoloration reduces. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream absorbs into my skin quickly, so I can apply foundation without having to wait forever. It has a creamy texture, and smooths on evenly. The pump dispenser gives just the right amount for my face and neck. I have used it for a week every morning. My skin feels softer and smoother, but I haven't noticed a ""lift"" yet. I will definitely continue to use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the bottle and how the lotion is dispensed by the pump. However I am very disappointed that the SPF is only 20!!!! I need at least 30 so I have to use another product?? If I'm buying a two in one product I want it to have the benefits that I need and prefer. Otherwise, I liked the weight of this day lotion. It's a perfect texture for under makeup preparation. That's why the 4 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the L'Oreal Paris revitalift triple power facial day lotion sod 20 for a little over a week. I like how it keeps my face hydrated and helps protect my face from the sun during the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the L'oreal Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion for about 1 week now and it's lightweight and not greasy.This goes great under the makeup. The Sunscreen effect is an added bonus. This one does not leave residue like other sunscreen products. Overall I am happy about this product. I would use this product for some more time to see if it really reduces the wrinkles and dark spots as promised. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I live in a climite where we have winters. I have only used this product 2 times because we have a super rainy October. The 2 times I did wear it on sunny days it worked, just how I imagined. I applied it in the morning after washing my face. It was quick to absorb and didn't leave my face feeling shiny or greasy. I didn't feel a need ro apply this halfway through my day as my skin still felt soft and moist but not oily. This is a great SPF moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the daytime lotion for six days. It made my skin feel smoother. The texture is creamy and of medium weight. It goes on easily for complete coverage. I was surprised that it had a fragrance. However, it was mild and pleasant. Along with the serum, I wore it most days without my usual foundation makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal revitalift with spf20 works very well. Its nice to have a product that serves a dual purpose . The wrinkles are slowly getting fewer and the sun screen helps protect from the damage of the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oréal has nailed it! My face is soft and feels nourished. My wrinkles seem to be diminishing after day 5! I feel like I look younger than 45 . This is definitely a feel good look good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the day lotion with SPF of 20 is getting to be a must. Age spots are not an beauty object. I have a few. I can't say enough about sunscreen. I kind of feel bad about mine as I've always had some sunscreen on. I like the sample I got. It really applied well and smelled really nice. Please put some sample packets out so folks could try them at makeup counters. Folks just need to have a chance to try the product. We all need help with sun damage.

I tried this on my face on some discolorations that I have and it actually lightened it up. I was very impressed and glad I was able to try it. I am going to continue to use this for hopefully continued results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great moisturizer with the plus of the SPF. I put it on and within 5 minutes it feels as if it's not there.I have been using it for 3 weeks and have seen no change in my dark spots. I have noriced slight changes with wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love it. It absorbs quickly and I do not feel sticky to my face. I usually do not like to use SPF because it made my face sticky. I would buy this to use. I check out the price which is good. My skin is soft and smell good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The daily lotion smells WONDERFUL- also goes on super smooth and sinks into your skin quickly. I have had many compliments but n the glow of my face in the past several days. I have used this product in conjunction with the concentrate so I believe both together work the best. I have some pretty severe dry patches left over from when I had my daughter and they are a lot softer and smoother now. Highly recommend this product!

"I've tried the Triple Power Facial Day Lotion for 2 days and both days my skin was irritated by something in it . It would start tingling and then turn red in some areas. After the first day, I tried it again and didn't put makeup on all day to see if it would still be irritated and it still was. I will just stick with the Triple Power Deep Acting Moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like having the spf. I just wish you got a higher sun protection factor than 20. Like 30+. On the other hand I have dark spots that are kinda stuborn and the loreal revitalift is I think actually making them less noticeable. All in all the revitalift set is worth it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this under my makeup everyday. I live in California so spf is always needed. The scent was lite and i enjoyed it. With one pump was enough for my whole face and neck. I did start to notice my fine lines getting softer. I think over time ising this product i could help take away some of the small wrinkles i am starting to get. Im always cautious when a product claims so many things but this one i can say really worked for me so far [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have an issue with dry spot on my face and unevenness. Once i started to use this product i noticed immediately my complextion started to get better my dry spots almost vanished. My makeup looked so much better while wearing this moisturizer set. I also noticed what wrinkles i started to get seemed to get softer as i used this product. My faced looked much younger and that made my confidence sore thru the roof [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is my favorite product of the RevitaLift samples that I received. It's a super light-weight moisturizer and the SPF is just an added bonus. It does have a slight perfume scent to it which I don't really care for (which is why i took a star off) but other than that, i really like it. It goes on smooth and soaks into my skin fast. I use it every morning under my serum and makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the L'oreal RevitalLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20. First plus, it has sunscreen in it. After one week, I noticed a difference on some fine lines and a discoloration.

I absolutely love the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20! One of the obvious reasons is the SPF 20 so I know my skin is protected. I use the product daily and am really seeing a difference in my skin. It's hydrated and feeling very nice. Only reason I give it 4 stars is because it burns if it gets into my eyes.. So be careful when applying. Very easy to use and has a clean scent. Plan to continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product in the mornings on the weekends. It works great when I am not wearing makeup outside working on the yard and gardens. I am looking forward to using this product in the summer months when the sun is really high in the sky. October/November in Minnesota, not so much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It seems that whenever I use things with SPF, it is so thick and it has a weird texture. This RevitaLift is great! It is not thick and heavy. It is so smooth, and I can put my makeup on over it while still being protected from the sun. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the RevitaLift facial day lotion and not only does it go on and makes my face feel great, it smells amazing. I have been told I have a glow and I have been asked what I'm doing different. I have brought it to work to show the my co-workers. A couple of the girls said they will be buying it for them self! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this in the morning's along with; the concentrated serum and the deep-acting moisturizer. I tried them all separately, but using them all together I loved. Before bed time and in the morning's while I'm putting them on has become my little bit of me time.I recommend all three of these from L'OREAL PARIS.

I think I would buy this product from the store. I really like it and it makes me feel smooth on my face and neck. So smooth I didn't wear makeup today. I'm going to look for the price ducts today in the store and price them so I can purchase when my samples are gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been looking for a moisturizer with a SPF for sometime. The others I have tried have been thick and don't blend easily. This is the opposite. It's not thick and I can smooth it on my face easily. I have sensitive skin that breaks out easily and I haven't had any break outs or rashes! Going to buy on my own!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is one of the best facial lotions (in a set) I have ever used! I have very sensitive skin that is easily irritated by fragrances and new products, but I had zero problem with breakouts or reaction after using the lotion! It smells soooooo good! You do not have to use a lot, however, It leaves your face feeling a little oily, not in a bad I-just-ate-a-whole-pizza way, but in a using- way-too-much-moisturizer. If you are considering giving it a try, go for it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I usually don't use sunscreen on my face because I don't like the feeling of grease on my face . This isn't it makes my skin soft so I will use it. Yes I will tell other people who think like me to use it also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I like this daytime lotion. It was very moisturizing. Oftentimes, day lotions can be too light for me. This didn't feel heavy, but felt good. Left my skin replenished and ready for makeup. I wish the SPF was a bit higher than 20, and I'd give it 5 stars! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
What a great finish after nourishing my skin during the night with the other two products! It was a super moisturizer under my makeup. It even made my makeup slide on better with no dry patches or wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have normal to dry skin and most face creams leave my skin itchy and greasy, NOT this cream at all! I love it, my face feels soft and glowing, healthy all day long! I highly recommend the entire line of L'Oreal products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20. It is lightweight and absorbs fully into my skin before I put on my makeup. I have worn a facial sunscreen product for the last 15 years, and that is winter and summer, 365 days a year. It does not irritate my skin, and does not leave a residue like other sunscreen products that are supposed to be for the face. I now have the perfect facial sunscreen and I am sticking with it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After washing my face adding the lightly scented lotion makes my skin feeling luxurious. It is absorbed immediately and has gotten rid of my dry skin areas. Has spf30 so no need to add any additional products before I leave my home. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I pretty much buy or use whatever skincare items come as samples with my online orders, or with my Ipsy bag. I was pleasantly surprised by this item, and all the items in this line by L'Oréal. They smell amazing, and work great at combatting my dry skin. Very creamy and smooth, and the smallest amount goes a loooonnnnggg way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 2) for a week. The scent of the product smells too much like sunscreen for my taste, but it does go away rather quickly. The product is lightweight and does not make my skin oily-and I have oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the product overall I feel my skin softer and less blemishes however not really sure on the spf because I never used sunblock but maybe that could be getting rid of the blemishes. Thank you L'Oreal and Bzzagent for the free sample. I real like the day and night regiment it means I am getting around the clock protection for my skin.

"I went in skeptical of this product, but was pleasantly surprised. It is a thick lotion with a slightly old lady smell to it, but it works wonderfully and the smell doesn't last long. I felt like I needed to use a lot to get full facial coverage since it really absorbed in. It left my face so soft and surprisingly non greasy. I would recommend this product to anyone with dry to oily skin as I have both and got great results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was super excited to be part of this trial. It's hard to find a good, lightweight moisturizer for a decent price that has spf for daytime use. I find this very lightweight and am enjoying it so far. The pump lets out a little more than my face can take (perhaps I just have a small face lol!), but doing just over a half pump seems perfect for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the packaging of this product but the smell reminds me of dog shampoo. I did make my skin feel smooth but did nothing for the fine lines in my face. The smell is a deal breaker for me, too bad I really wanted to like this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I actually used this product during a tough mudder race in Nevada. I had forgotten to pack my usual sunscreen. This product worked as a sunscreen because I did not get red like I sometimes do. I have used it since I have returned from my trip and I feel like I don't get splotchy when I get out of the sun. I like this and will purchase it. Hope it does lighten my brown spots.

"Was not impressed at all. Didn't notice a difference in skin appearance, felt mildly heavy on skin, wasn't a fan of the fragrance at all. Did however make my skin a little more soft but other then that I wasn't impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"it works great as a daily moisturizer which also has SPF 30 sunscreen in it. The pump dispenses just the right amount of product. It went on smoothly over the serum, however I am not fond of the two product approach; I prefer one and done. I have used the product for one week, however I haven't seen any remarkable difference in my skin's appearance. For future use, I would want to know how the product stands alone without the serum first. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Amazing products I have sensitive skin and at my age (48) I have to be careful what products I use some make my skin dry some oily this was perfect blend to make my face feel fresh and clean I love it thank you so much for the opportunity! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The lotion with SPF is one of my favorite products. It's great to have the SPF in the lotion already to protect from wrinkles and further sun damage. I felt like it was a little greasy or think for a lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using L'Oreal's Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 for about a week now, morning and night. A little goes a long way and I love that it has the sunscreen in it! Sunscreen is very important to me since I live at the beach. It goes on smoothly, doesn't leave a greasy feeling. I have noticed my skin tone is evening out (no more red spots) and my skin is looking smoother! So far so good with this product. A very light and airy lotion! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this lotion for a little over a week now and I love it. It is light, has a great smell and leaves my skin soft, with the added SPF you can't go wrong. I highly recommend using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've always been a fan of L'Oreal skincare products and love this one as well. I love using a daytime moisturizer that contains SPF but doesn't feel greasy on my skin, L'Oreal has done it again! The scent is light but pleasant and it's very comfortable on the skin. This is great to use every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to try out the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20. I not only needed a day lotion, but when it comes with sunscreen in it, that's a huge bonus. The lotion isn't watery like some others and it's not too thick. It glides on smoothly and my skin absorbs it so easily. I will be using this every day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really oily and sensitive skin. I have been using the SPF lotion for about a week and I like it. I like to use both a moisturizer and an SPF and with this, I feel like I can without having my skin appear greasy. With my sensitive and oily skin I was afraid I'd react to this product, but happily, I can say it has not caused any breakout thus far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the feel of this. It didn't leave my face all greasy when I applied it and gave me the sun protection I need. It hasn't been real sunny here but since I have fair skin, I use sunscreen year round. I use this as a base under my makeup. I have only been using it a week so I don't have much more information as to what else it is doing for my skin. I will wait until I have used it longer to post anything else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free and it is my favorite for cold winter days. I applied the lotion in the morning and ,y skin looks fresh! Not greasy or heavy and I did not smell like a cheap pharmacy (other lotions do). It feels like if you are wearing nothing on your face, but you look refreshed even with out makeup! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did get a few breakout pimples from this, but I just has a baby so it could be my hormone change. This product does feel nice and has a light refreshing smell. I think it will work out great in the winter when my skin gets dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am actually pleasantly surprised because I have very sensitive skin and have been very limited to what I can use for a daily moisturizer without causing breakouts. So far, this has not caused my skin to break out while providing great moisture throughout the day. I would have given it 5 stars except I wish it was just a little lighter. It does cause my face to be a bit shiny. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is an amazing product. I received a full size sample and can hardly believe how effective it is. I've been using products that cost 4 times as much and have not worked as quickly as this does [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this I hate knowing how much damage the sun causes, this is a pretty good product and I truly love that L'Oréal has come up with this whole line of products that work together. Instead of having to purchase different products that do the same thing as this on does. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this moisturizer. It's in a pump so no sticking you fingers in something. It's a little on the thick side but it has SPF so I expect that. Overall I'm very happy with this. It has a very light sent but it's pleasant. I also used it on my hands after applying to my face and my hands feel so hydrated. I'm very impressed with it and look forward to buying it. I received this product complimentary from BzzAgent for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This lotion is fantastic. It is light and once it absorbs into your skin I can't even feel it, I just feel softness. After one week my skin feels so soft and has a glow. I used a little too much the first couple of days, but once I got the amount adjusted it was fantastic. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very happy to try this line of skincare. The day lotion is a premium product. Goes on smooth, and sinks right into my skin with no greasy feeling afterwards. Makes my skin glow and look visibly brighter. Used in conjunction with the other loreal products from this line and your face will thank you. I not only use these products on my face but also my neck and chest. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion with SPF 20. I began using this to replace my current moisturizer with sunscreen. I have very sensitize skin and this product has been face friendly. :-) It is light and it smells pretty. I feel like I can wear it under my makeup without feeling like my face gets too heavy. I've been wearing it everyday for the past two weeks along with the other products in the treatment series and I do see the tightening effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this lotion is Great! Before putting on my makeup I apply this lotion. It soaks up fast not leaving skin feeling greasy or oily. When I put my makeup on it does not affect the way it goes on either. When pumping lotion out of bottle, you do not need a bunch it goes a long ways. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for several days now. I like the fact that it has SPF in it and it's also got some good ingredients for fighting the signs of aging. I'm not a huge fan of the smell, it's not super strong or anything but as a migraine sufferer, scent is an trigger for me to get one. However, I can say that the smell fades pretty quickly so I've been able to use with no issues. My skin looks smooth and feels very soft to the touch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this moisturizer daily in combination with the L'Oreal Revitalift serum and I am very happy with them so far! The product goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. It does not leave any greasy or oily residue. So far I feel like my skin looks more bright and healthy! The SPF 20 is definitely a bonus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just started using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 about a week ago when I received it. It is amazing as it keeps my face smooth and moisturized all day. Even with combination skin, it still doesn't feel oily. And the SPF in the lotion protects from sun damage! I use this every morning after the serum and so far it is great and the more I use it the more I expect to see results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't think this is a necessary step in the 3-step Triple Power regeme. The first two creams already moisturize your face. If you really need a facial moisturizer that has sunscreen in it, I don't see this one being any different from anything else on the market. It's in durable packaging and smells nice, but I just don't see a value in having an expensive plain lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin is very dry and if I don't put a moisturizer on before my make up my skin looks flaky. I have been using this for 9 days right before I put on my make up and it's amazing. It's instantly absorbed into the skin and doesn't make you appear greasy or shiny. I highly recommend this as an every day item!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been looking for a daily moisturizer with SPF that also does a bit something extra. As a women in my almost late 30's I am starting to become aware of fine lines that I want to nip in the bud. Of course this hasn't been long enough to see real results, or at least I haven't. but this feels nice, doesn't leave me with that oily/sun screeny feeling when I apply and layers nicely under foundation. Also little to no smell which is a plus. Definitely will keep using [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion with SPF 20 works great for your face to prevent sunburn. It's very moisturizing and works great under my makeup. I love that it's not greasy like a lot of other brands I've tried in the past. My favorite thing about it though is how quickly it absorbs into my skin! The only downside I found in using this product was it gave me several blemishes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used the triple power facial sunscreen daily for the past week, and love it. My face feels smooth and clean, and doesn't have the normal ""suncreeny"" type scents. So far, even with working outdoors daily in this crazy 80degree November weather, my face has maintained its hydration and I have not burned or even appeared to have been working in the hot sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This Facial Moisturizer with SPF 20 is amazing. It is silky and not sticky like many moisturizers are. It is thick and consistant which deeply softens and moisturizers your skin like so many thin and runny ones that do not help. The added SPF 20 to protect my skin from harmful UV Rays is just an added bonus, will highly recammend and never use anything else! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The scent of this day lotion is great! I like that it doesn't sting my sensitive skin like some SPF items can. It gives me a light moisturized feel that doesn't feel weighed down even with makeup on top! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This lotion was great. It was not greasy. It did not have a strong Oder to it. You don't have to use a lot. It did not make your face fell like it was dirty. It cleaned up easy and it has a sun protection in it. Thank you buzz agent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I can't say enough about my trying L'Oreal Paris Revitalize Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 a real remarkable product i will keep using it i have a couple girl friends that got theirs yesterday they are so serious to try it and experience the results them selves i think it really says a lot for L'Oreal as a great place to start #GetItFree it has done wonders for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have been using the product for about a week now, and I love the RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion. The added SPF protection makes me feel that I am protecting my skin, and the lotion is not too heavy. My skin is also fairly sensitive, and I am not noticing new breakouts or irritation when using this product. I would definitely recommend this face lotion for use in conjunction with the facial serum from the same L'Oreal line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My dermatologist was adamant that I use a minimum SPF 30, so while I appreciate that there's something in the product line for daytime wear, I would need a separate sinsceeen when truly exposed to the sun. The thing that's makes me still consider buying this again is the fact that it caused no greasiness and no breakouts. So for normal day-to-day exposure when I'm just running from my car into the office, this would suffice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was a great way to protect the skin and mosturize at the same time and making the skin look better and healthier. Definately looking for ward to seeing how long term use of this product will affect the age ... moisture and well being of my skin. I like that the smell of the product isnt over powering as well. Scents often are too strong.. this one was just right. I got thies free to try as a bzzagent.. for my honest opinion [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm so impressed with how the combination of all three of these face moisturizers make me feel and look!! I have had compliments on my skin looking younger by my friends and family! I love L'Oreal products even more now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I usually wear make up with an spf of 20, so I was not super excited to try the Triple Power Facial Day Lotion. However after trying it I will continue to use it. The lotion went on smoothly, was not heavy, greasy or watery. I was hoping for dramatic results, such as smoother skin and a reduction of blemishes. Although these results were not achieved I will continue to use this product as my daily sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have never really use this type of product before and I am surprised by how much I like it. I like that it has some sunscreen in it without smelling or feeling like sunscreen. It goes on smooth and rubs in really well. My skin still feels soft at the end of the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The sunscreen does not have a greasy feeling at all compared to other facial sunscreens I've tried. The smell was not overwhelming and I liked the product had both UVA/UVB protection.

"I tried the L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion with SPF 20. This day facial moisturizer felt and smelled great. I really liked that it was 20 spf, vs 15 like my usual day cream. My face didn't feel oily after and my face soaked up the product immediately. It's great to know it's helping to reverse any signs of aging as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how lightweight but effective this Moisturizer is. I have really dry skin so usually need to apply a thick heavy Moisturizer in the morning so I don't get dry patches after I apply my makeup. This Moisturizer not only helps my dry skin look hydrated and soft but also is so lightweight and doesn't break out my sensitive skin. I also love the fact that is contains spf!

"L""Oreal's Day Lotion with SPF 20 is brilliant! Not only do you get the SPF 20, but it soaks in, or dries fast enough that you can put your make-up on in no time. It's very light on your skin, so even with make-up on you don't feel like your face is weighted down by gunk. And some days I don't even need make-up. It seems to have put the 'rosy' back into my cheeks! I would recommend this to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is awesome skin cream. I have been using this for two weeks thank to bzzagent I feel revitalize in my face My skin is soft and radiant I highly recommend this if you have fine line and dry skin I love the package also. Thanks bzzagent for accepting me In this campaign. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"goes on smoothly and rubs in better than other spf lotions. a little more oily after being on for a little bit than i'd like, but that is because of the sun screen in it, so i guess that is to be expected. Smells great too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Always wear sunscreen! So this has you covered with sunscreen plus anti-aging moisturizer. What more could you want. Light feeling but powerful working. Corrects past sun damage while protecting you skin from further sun damage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wow, this product fades previous dark spots from sun damage while protecting from new sun damage. Also softens skin and improves texture. You should always wear sun screen so this is a great product to use because it will improve your skin condition (less wrinkles, less dark spots, smoother texture and tone) while protecting your facial skin from more sun damage.

I like the texture and weight of this day lotion. It absorbs quickly so I can prime and put my makeup on. This bottle is nice because it has pump dispense so I don't dump a big puddle in my hand and waste product. There is no strong smell and that is a plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I cannot say enough about this lotion with SPF 20. I don't always wear foundation and this lotion leaves my skin looking and feeling soft and not shiny. Under foundation is also great because it is light and helps the foundation to smooth out on your face. Great day lotion with the added benefits of SPF20. Love it!

"I finally had a chance to try this product out. I really love it. I wear it under my makeup and I feel protected against any UV rays.

I used the Day lotion in the morning as part of my morning make up ritual. It made my skin feel smooth & more even toned. My skin felt instantly hydrated when I used it. I have sensitve skin & it seemed to be a little strong smelling for my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I am very fair so whenever I go outside, I absolutely have to wear sunscreen. What I like best about this Day Lotion is that it blends in without leaving any white residue around the creases of my nose or in my eye brows! Most days I combine it with the Deep-Acting Moisturizer and it's still not too heavy. My face already seems brighter and smoother even though it's only been 2 weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this stuff. It goes on well, soaks in quick, isn't greasy, and has spf 20. The scent is a little strong to me but it dissipates quickly. My skin seems brighter, firmer, and clearer using this in conjunction with other RevitaLift products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"If I'm being honest, I rarely, if ever use sunscreen when I'm not out in the sun. I used to think it would be a hassle to put on sunscreen every day and worried about a greasy appearance. I love this lotion. It smooths in very easily and can be worn under make-up with no problem. Putting it on as just another step with morning facial cleaning and make-up is totally do-able. I am impressed with the RevitaLift system. I feel more confident about my skin since using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this sunscreen. I spend a lot of time outside and I never want to use a greasy sunscreen on my face. This product is light and clean and offers the protection I need with a great moisturizer at the same time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So I tried the cream and I have developed a rash :( not sure if it's the facial cream. It's the only new product I've tried so I'm going to let the rash go away and then give it another try. Maybe because I used two products at once my skin didn't llook me it lol!! But I will try it again when it heals up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the serum, day lotion and deep moisturizer for about a week. I already notice a difference. My skin is smoother and brighter. I haven't noticed any difference with wrinkles but it's only been a week. I like the smell of these products. I haven't had any problems even with my sensitive skin. The moisturizer doesn't leave a slimey feeling on my skin. It soaks in pretty quick. Overall good skincare system. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used the Triple power day lotion for 7 days. I am 66 years old. I have deep wrinkles and rough skin. Some of the roughness is caused by an autoimmune disease. I never thought it would be soft again. I use it with the Revitalift triple action serum twice a day. My face and neck feel baby soft. My husband noticed it and says I look younger. I do not know about that but it sure is smooth, soft, and glowing. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think my face is getting softer , Still Trying to see if this product is erasing some of my wrinkles. I am excited to see if I look younger ! Again I am noticing a difference , face is softer and a little smoother. I am 50 years old and usually it's my forehead that has a wrinkle I dislike. Hopefully LOREAL PARIS Revital Lift will improve my whole entire face ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the texture and feel of this SPF lotion on my face. It wears well under foundation all day with no shine or oiliness on my normal-dry skin. It has a slight scent without your typical sunscreen smell and doesn't leave a white cast when applied. The SPF 20 is a great added bonus in this hydrating lightweight daytime lotion.

I have been enjoying my L'Oreal Day Lotion for my face every morning since I had it. It doesn't leave my skin oily or greasy. My skin feels very vibrant and smooth.

"I have never used an SPF lotion before, I was skeptical about how it would feel on my skin. Any time I put SPF anything on my face it always feels very sticky. Well not with L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20. My face felt smooth and the texture was light on my face, it did not feel sticky or heavy at all. I know SPF is important to protect your skin and keep it looking it's best, so from know on I will be using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I this this product awesome ! I have dry skin. It's just enough for my skin not to be oily. A lil but goes a long way so not much is needed. And is also great as a primer on your face under your foundation. So happy with this whole line and happy with my firm hydrated skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the Revitalift Triple Power sunscreen has worked wonders on my skin. Especially, since I do not normally use sunscreen. And, I have a fresh feeling and look to my skin in the daytime. I spread it evenly on my face and neck right after I use the Revitalift Concentrated Serum treatment-then the Triple Power Deep-Acting moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I spent a week with the Revitalift triple power Day lotion. First I used it along with the serum, but then I wanted to try it as a stand alone. I'm glad that this has sunscreen protection. Spf 20 is great to have in a face cream, but I didn't like the way it made my skin look. It made my skin matte, and took a long time to rub in, it really felt more like sunscreen so I wouldn't suggest wearing that alone. It smells fine, tho I'm not a fan of the sunscreen scent it has. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed using this product on my skin. It wasn't oily or greasy and like the scent as well. I also love that the product offers different benefits and love that the SPF is in it to protect my skin from the sun and keep it healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Used once on Saturday I do not go out much but it was unseasonably warm here and sunny I felt it did well held up to sweat well. Looking forward to applying more often this up coming summer when I go to Local Ren Faire to get a butter ideal of how well it helps fade age spots--Or should I use it now even if I am not going out doors?

I absolutely Love Love Loreal Revitalift. I don't think I can express how much. I have been searching for a whole year for a product that had everything to use as part of my day/night regime. I am about to make the big 45 and wanted to make sure I knew what product has everything and Loreal Revitalift has it all. An absolutely great line of products..

I have been using this product for 3 days now. I is a very light weight product. I doesn't feel heavy on my skin. Not greasy as some lotions are. It has a very refreshing smell and the smell last. I only takes a little and it goes a long way. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Initially I tried to use all of the products in this trio at the same time. This produced a bit of an over moisturized effect. The next couple of days I used this in the morning and then the serum at night. I have somewhat oily skin so the combination of products was too much but the serum and moisturizer with SPF 20have been working out really well. I like the light scent of the moisturizer and the fact that my skin feels hydrated but not at all oily. Great product. Thanks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product i received as a bzzagent tester, made my skin seem really radiant and smooth after only a few uses. The lotion is super easy to use but the scent is a little off putting. Aside from the smell i have no complaints about this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am very fair skinned so my only concern would be in the sunny summer it may not be enough SPF for me. Now that being said, I love the way this feels on my skin. I apply daily and have used for a little over a week and I am pleased with the results. I feel my skin is softer and my 11 lines are not quite as noticeable. I will definitely continue using and recommend for anyone to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Has helped my brown spots on my face. Great product. Feels great against my skin, non greasy, goes on smooth and moisturizes great. It absorbs great. Made my skin feel like I received a small facial. I will recommend this product to all my friends and family. Love it. I will continue to use and buy this product.

I have been using the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift triple power day lotion with sunscreen for 7 days now and its an amazing product ! My skin is much clearer and seems firmer ! There is noticeable changes in my complexion from using this product! Along with this i also have used the night serum and Revitalift moisturizer at night and i love love love it all ! I totally recommend this to any age lady not just aging skin as a routine regime for daily skin care! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have very sensitive skin and using moisturizer that has sunscreen in it typically caused me to breakout over time. However so far this o e hasn't! I love the smell and how light weight it feels. I would respond this product to anyone ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this day lotion moisturizer is perfect. In my day #8 i can said that im really happy with the changes i noticed in my skin. I could't ask for something better. My skink is protect all day. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using this about a week ago everyday in the AM following the serum and I can honestly say my uneven skin is looking better. Most days my dark spots bother me but I have actually noticed the lighter Ines are disappearing. If you buy and use this do not push pump down all the way unless you want to cover your face, neck and back of hands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product is great. A lot of over the counter stuff either stings my skin or is way too thick and breaks me out. The lake toon is great! It has a pleasant smell. It goes on smooth and doesn't bother my skin. Feels higher end. Very pleased. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF20 is a Godsend!!! I have used this every day for a week and my skin feels amazing. I love that it has the SPF 20 because I am outdoors a lot. I love having a lotion that works so well on your skin AND protects it from the suns harmful rays. Thank you so much BzzAgent for this sample to try for free. This will be a constant in my beauty regime! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed the simplicity of use and great quality of the Day Lotion. I love to use something with an SPF in it, but I don't like my skin to feel oily. This works very well. I was so pleased with the product. I've found it pairs perfectly with the Deep Acting Facial Moisturizer for all day protection. I also love the look and feel of the product's canister. It's just so classy and cute! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product has made me feel so much better about my skin. It has caused the hyper-pigmentation from my acne scars to become less visible without a strong chemical or medicinal smell. The formula is light weight and offers sun protection which is a year round concern for me in Southeast Texas. It absorbs quickly without leaving an oily residue and the pump allows me to pack it away in my purse for a hydration boost on the go. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can not say enough good things about this product. I love everything about it. Goes on smooth and silky and is not greasy. Absorbs very fast. Smells great, and the packaging is so cute. I'm going to purchase the other product in this beauty line later today bc I love it that much! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the sunscreen so much! I've tried other products that leave that greasy feeling but L'Oréal triple action sunscreen is so light and just melts into your face. I can immediately put makeup on after and it doesn't effect how the makeup goes on! This combination of skin care is lightening my dark spots and making my skin so soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that this is a good product. It smells nice when you put it on. The smell does not stay around all day. I like the fact that there is SPF in it. This is something that I need every day even in winter in the midwest. My overall experience was good. It went on smooth, i used a pretty small portion size. A little less than a dime, so I think the value is good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the Facial day lotion everyday for the past week and my skin is noticeably softer smoother and brighter. This product has a clean nice scent. I recommend this product for anyone looking for sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After trying the Loreal Paris sunscreen I am a huge fan. It absorbed so quickly and left no oily feel to my skin. It even left my skin feeling smoother. The smell was very pleasant and not overwhelming. The packaging also draws your attention and let's you know at the start what each product will do for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was my least favorite of the 3 lotions. I didn't dislike it by any means, it was just a very 'meh' experience. The scent is nice but the actual lotion texture is mediocre. It's a little thick for a day lotion, so I need to apply it well before my makeup routine so that it has time to sink in. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is amazing!! It doesnt leave a weird residue or any oily feeling. I was sceptical to put this on my face because I have senstive skin and I was sure it would break me out! Well, im on day 4 and loving it more and more! I probably would have never bought this on my own, but now it will be part of my life! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I went ahead and gave L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 a four star because Ive used it once and liked that it smell good and was light weight, my face normally doesn't like lotion with spf in it and I didn't notice any problems. I really haven't been in the sun with the lotion yet, I have sensitive skin and normally burn easy so it will be a good test to see if the lotion works. In a week or two I'll be able to write a better review for the day lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this product at night so when i wake up my skin is so soft. I've used it for the last 5 days and I am noticing improvement in the way my skin feels already. It is light and has a great scent. I am excited to see what my skin will feel/look like in the next few weeks. So excited. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This lotion is great i use it through out the day when im going outside and underneath my makeup as the moisturizer since it has Spf 20 it amazing. I notice my makeup last longer anf my skin stays more hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like this product to use in the morning. I've used it for the last 4 days in addition to the serum and deep acting moisturizer and I am noticing improvement in the way my skin feels already. It is lightweight and has a delicate scent. I am excited to see what my skin will feel and look like in the next few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like any product that has multiple uses for it- moisturizing plus SPF is a great combination. This lotion is not greasy, covers well, and I feel would work great in the long run. I do not like the smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this works to lighten dark spots but it smells, I feel like I'm putting on senior citizen cream, meaning it smells like hospital and old person. I would use this more if the smell wasn't so offensive [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for about a week. It has made my skin feel smoother but the only thing I didn't like about it is how greasy it felt. This moisturizer is for the day time but I wouldn't want to put my makeup on top of it. I probably would not purchase this product if I was picking one out in the store. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This an awesome product. I must admit when I put some in my hand I thought my face was going to be one grease ball. To my surprise it was lightweight and a had nice smell. Not oily at all. The SPF 20 is a plus. Thanks L'Oréal !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This stuff is thick without being too much, other moisturizers I've used seem thin and almost watery not this stuff! Also little goes along way, I love that just one pump will cover my whole face and then some. I honestly didn't notice a smell at first, there is one but nothing overwhelming, it's nice scent. It leaves my face feeling nice soft without being greasy. In just a few days I noticed that the few dry patches I had disappeared. I will definitely continue using! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product smelled a little funny, a little too floral for my liking. But I really like how smoothly it went on my skin! 8 felt like my skin was dewy and moisturized all day and I really like that it has SPF protection. However, I didn't see a visible reduction in my wrinkles. I was expecting more wrinkle reduction and was disappointed in this factor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was a little confused at first when I opened up this package. I thought it was a A light lotion moisturizer but it turned out to be sunscreen. It's light and non greasy and it just melts into your skin not like your typical sunscreen. Very impressed. Will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this moisturizer great. I shared it with My Mom and sister who loved it also. It makes our skin feel smooth and nice to the touch. We are always looking for some way to get rid of wrinkles and we have found our way now. We will look for it in the stores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I thought this product was phenomenal. My face feels very smooth. I didn't break out. The moisture last over 24 hrs. I highly recommend this product to everyone. I see my fine lines around my eyes going away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved that the day cream has spf in it. I'm constantly searching for a quality face cream that doubles as a sunscreen as well to save myself a step. My only complaint about this lotion is the consistency. My skin is aging, and I feel I need a thicker lotion to Cindy's those fine lines that come with dry Mature skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer smells good and was light enough to put under my makeup. What I like best about this is the spf factor, too bad you have to apply so often, but it is still worth trying. I have been using this only in the morning and along with the serum and deep acting moisturizer at night, so i do not know which is working more for the wrinkles, but this is not breaking me out or making matters worse, so i will continue with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am always looking for a face cream that doesn't make me feel like I have any on. Well, I have found it! I love how it makes my skin soft with the added protection of the SPF 20. It's been a short time but I have already noticed a difference with smoother looking skin. Love the clean scent too! Just be careful not to get any on your lips, it doesn't taste to well. (Haha) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Finally! A product that does not break me out or smell like the beach! I can wear it to social events without drawing attention. It absorbs quickly and doesn't leave a greasy sheen on my face and my pores can breathe. This will be my facial go-to SPF from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am 50+ years old and have never been consistent wearing any kind of moisturizer, sunscreen, etc. due to skin sensitivity. If you have sensitive skin, this product is for you. It's lightweight and your makeup works great with it. I have only used for a few days but love the way it feels and how my skin is looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This Triple Power Facial Day Lotion is wonderful and it has SPF 20 to help protect you from harmful UV rays. Nice soft smell, not greasy at all and it comes in an easy to use pump. I work at a school doing carpool daily in the afternoon and knowing that the moisturizer has SPF 20 included helps out a great deal because I no longer have to carry extra sunscreen with me. I will diffidently purchase this product once I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As a moisturizer, this has a nice light feel and spreads easily. It does leave a slightly greasy feeling for a little while, but it's manageable. As a sunblock, there are other products out there that last so much longer. Unless I misread, the bottle says to reapply every two hours. I don't have time for that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this lotion- it says to use it in the morning. It helps protect your face from UV rays so you can feel a little safer going out in the sun light. I tried on my face and neck also on my arms and I have to say I think this lotion can be used all over. It goes not smoothly and love the scent. I apply my make up afterwards and I feel that I'm being protect from the harmful ray and my make up goes not nicer. It easy to use and I love this as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like this lotion. It has moisturizer to help promote healthy skin and sunscreen to help prevent more damage. It has a light scent. Its perfume like. I use very little of it at a time. It spreads well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Today is my first day trying a L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift product. So far, so good! The day lotion goes on smoothly and covers more than I thought it would with only one pump. It left my skin feeling soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oréal hit the nail on the head with this one! This is one of the best smelling day lotions with SPF, ever. Finally a light weight option that doesn't smell like sunscreen. It absorbs quickly and leaves the skin feeling refreshed. You only need one pump, if that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very impressed by the feel of my skin after zi applied the daytime lotion. It felt soft and silky. I asked an acquaintance if they thought my face looked greasy after I had it on a few minutes. Their response was ""No I tthink it looks glowing:)"". Very excited to see what the next 2 weeks bring. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was happy with ALL 3 products, the Serum, the deep Moisturizer and this particular Day Lotion. The lotion was light and easy for a day time use and made it easier for me to apply my makeup afterwards. I have not switched my face products in a long time but I think I just officially switched = one happy camper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This stuff smells great. It's not oily or greasy and it doesn't leave a film on your face or neck. My skin feels soft after. It almost remind me of a liquid to powder makeup in a way. A tiny amount goes a long way and I feel something good happening when it's applied. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried the L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion for 3 days now and dont know how i ever lived without it. The product feels light and soft on my skin. It also has a very nice clean scent to it. Very refreshing and cool when first applied. I absolutely love this product and recommend it to anyone looking for a great daily wear spf cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm glad I got to try this daily lotion. It's pretty comparable to a different lotion brand that I use. It's nice to have the sunscreen built in, and it actually has a higher SPF than most daily lotions on the market. I probably wouldn't buy this lotion because it doesn't seem different than the lotion I currently use, but I'm really happy I have a full bottle to use. Who knows--after some more time, I might change my mind and switch! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have now been using the Triple Power Facial Lotion for 3 day and my skin feels amazing! The product is light, not heavy and is a great compliment under my everyday make up. There is no stickiness at all like other products I have tried in the past. I would recommend REvitalift products to anyone looking for a new and better for their skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I began to use this product, I thought the scent was really amazing, not too strong but a refreshing scent. L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20 left my face feeling so soft and moisturized and what makes this product more amazing is that it has sunscreen in it to protect my face from at more Sun damage. To protect and better my face is a product worth using! I will continue to use this product and recommend it to friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The instructions say to apply liberally, but as you can see, I only used 1 pump and it felt like enough. I dabbed it in the center of the forehead, the nose, the chin, and the cheeks. Then ever so gently spread it over the whole face. The smell is faint and not offensive. It works well as a light moisturizer with the bonus of an SPF 20 sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've had the product for a few days and thus far, I love how it absorbs into the skin! It is very lightweight and does not leave a greasy feeling on your skin. I have some dark age spots on my skin and am excited that this product addresses this issue. I already feel like my skin is smoother and tighter feeling. I would want to know the price point of the product before trying it but so far it seems to be worth it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far I am loving the L'Oreal Revitalift Day lotion. I love that the formula is lightweight, and absorbs easily into my skin. It has a pleasent scent, and makes my skin feel super soft and moisturized after use. I love that it has SPF 20 in it also, it's so important, especially in the cooler months when I forget to apply sunscreen! I am loving this product so far and can't wait to see how my skin improves with continued use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This lotion is something I put on morning and night. A little bit goes a long way. THE scent is quite relaxing. The texture is silky smooth with an added thickness most lotions do not have. There is no greasy residue left on your skin after applying. I feel redness in my face is going down and that means a lot to us women. I definitely feel my skin is looking great at 35. The lotion is an amazing accent to the other products available. You won't be disappointed with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just received the L'Oreal Day lotion and feel generally that it is always great to have sunscreen on but my question is do you need another lotion that moisturizes after applying another moisturizer. I think the product would sell better if the moisturizer and the sunblock were in one lotion.For the consumer, this would be more economical in the long run. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first thing I noticed about this is that it's very lighweight. It wasn't greasy nor did it have a unpleasant scent. I like that it has SPF of 20, I noticed I didn't have any ""flash"" face in my pictures today either. I'm excited to see what this does for my skin in the next few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this moisturizer for a few days now. It leaves my skin feely velvety and soft, and I like that it has SPF, but it is heavy and takes a while (as well as a bit of rubbing in) to absorb. It smells nice but kind of strong. It does the job but just is not great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far so good! I used the Facial Day Lotion and it left my skin feeling very soft. It smelled great too! Even after sweating and working outside in the 90 degree AZ heat today my skin was still smooth. I didn't feel like I sweated it off which happens with other motions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just started using the new L'Oreal products and I am most impressed by the pleasant scent. Many other facial products have strong smells which are a huge turn off for me! Excited to see the 1st week results!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product works really great under makeup. My makeup lasted all day and looked fresh.it leaves your face soft and helps control appearance of fine lines. My makeup has never lasted all day like this with any other product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is absolutely wonderful it really seems to smooth your skin and honestly makes you look less tired I am truely amazed with results I have already seen I usually wear makeup every day and today I went without makeup and was told how beautiful my skin was I have never heard that complement before when I don't wear makeup it's worth a shot to try [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Okay seriously, this stuff is awesome. It's so lightweight and the fragrance is not overpowering. It did not break me out, which is saying something because I have crazy sensitive skin. If you wear it under makeup, remember: a little goes a long way. If you slather too much on, it could gunk a bit under foundation/BB cream. Smooth a small amount over your face and let soak in completely before applying anything else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got my kit last night, and applied hte lotion with spf today. It is so wonderful. Its light, refreshing and it has spf. SO on days where you only want to wear no make up, just apply and go. I can not wait to see the results of all these wonderful items. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Feels smooth on my skin. Goes on easily and not oily. My face stays moisturized all day. Works good with my makeup on. The jars are so shiny and pretty red! My skin is dry, oily and sensitive this product is perfect for me and all skin types! I would definitely buy in the store when I run out which might be a little while because you don't need to use every much and the jars are a good size. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is great for different skin types. I have never found anything to leave my skin so rejuvenated. I recommend every woman to include this product in your daily face regiment. It's not greasy feeling. It's very light and natural feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The third and probably most important product of the triple threat from a Florida girls stand point is the daily lotion with SPF in it. I love that I get lotion and sun block in one. As it is always sunny here. And it smells great. Everyone is always asking me what I am wearing. I love the light non greasy feel. This lotion has replaced all my other daily lotions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am pleasantly surprised on how fast acting this lotion is. I saw and felt some differences immediately after use. I love that is a SPF 20 so my sun exposure is diminished ight after use. My skin felt soft and lefmy skin somewhat brighter before my makeup even was applied. I do notice some fine lines diminished as well. Overall, I think the lotion is great for combating aging signs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like that it's not greasy. Goes on very smooth. A lot does come out with just one pump. I had lots of extra lotion, and it felt like a waste to have to wash it off my hands. The smell is kind of stong, but I do like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great day lotion. It doesn't feel heavy or greasy. It has an SPF of 20, which is great. I have not noticed any side effects from using it. I don't notice a strong scent, which is great. Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Great day lotion. Not thrilled about applying the lotion every two hours not very ideal for me. I would definitely be more likely if I didn't have to apply so often to protect my face from harmful UV rays [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think its a good product.I've always had problems with my face,but once I tried it.I could see some changes .My skin seem more happy.I would tell family and friends to try it.As a matter of fact my granddaughter uses it now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unfortunately, I'm allergic to Avobenzone, which is the second ingredient in this item, but I did test on a less sensitive area and I thought the formula and scent were quite pleasant. Seems like it would be a good weight for dry skin. I'll pass along to a friend to get their feedback! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The day lotion was really thick and a lot came out with one pump, but, it did moisturize well. The smell is nice but kind of strong. I have been using for a few days along with the regular moisturizer and serum; overall I think it is effective but just not my favorite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think L'OREAL, is on to something. I am a woman, that is a breast cancer survivor of 2 years. Part of my treatment was radiation, which has left my skin very dry. I had tried various moisturizers, either it was too heavy or not enough to hydrated my skin. When I tried the L'Oréal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power Facial Day Lotion SPF 20, it is PERFECT!!! It made my skin baby soft, the sunscreen was icing on the cake. Christmas, has come early for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this! It has spf 20 so you never have to feel bad about going out barefaced or with makeup. It light has a nice smell goes on smooth, feels light. Perfect for everyday use or touch ups. I personally like this for correcting fade spots and the discoloration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love love love the way it makes my face feel, and the smell is wonderful! It is silky smooth going on doesn't leave your Fae feeling greasy like most products. It is a must have in my daily routine from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This day lotion was very light on my combination/mostly dry and sensitive skin. It absorbed immediately and left a subtle glow which I loved. The texture is much better than my more expensive, heavier regular day lotion with SPF. I liked the fragrance, but it was a bit strong. I could smell it on my face several hours after applying - although at least it didn't smell like sunscreen. Can't wait to see how it does with repeated use! Overall, a very good daily lotion! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have yet to try a product like this that doesn't leave my face feeling oily. This one was no different, though I'd hoped it'd be so, since I generally tend to enjoy L'Oreal products. Couldn't wait to wash it off my face and hands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The facial daily lotion is wonderful. Does not have an odor and does not feel greasy like some other facial lotions on the market. I use it twice a day and my skin feels fabulous. I would highly recommend this product and I would buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This lotion...THIS is the lotion to use! It just took a small amount to cover my whole face. It isn't greasy either, which is great. I like that it has a broadband spf for protection against the harmful rays of aging from the skin. My skin feels fantastic! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't normally use a daily facial lotion with SPF in it because they sometimes cause me to break out, this did NONE of that!!! I am so happy to find something makes my skin so soft and still provides me with daily SPF. If you have issues with your skin from using products, this is a must try!!!!

"I just received my L'Oreal products last night. I could t wait to try it out. I used the Triple Power Facial Day Lotion with SPF 20. When i opened it I loved the scent of the lotion. When I first felt the lotion I thought it might feel heavy on my sensitive skin. It felt fabulous going on. I was pleasantly surprised that it did not feel heavy on my skin, it seemed to melt right into it. I can't wait to see how it works on my skin after a week and after a month. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the smell, it's not too strong. This moisturizer didn't leave my skin feeling oily, which I have encountered with other moisturizers. It makes my skin feel soft and refreshed. Plus, they stepped it up, not only is it fighting wrinkles and age spots (that are becoming more concerning as I age), they put in a SPF. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The lotion is a nice consistency, thick but doesn't feel heavy. It smooths on well. My complaint is the strong perfume scent. I prefer face lotions that have light or no scent at all. I'm sensitive to scents, and this one smells as if I'm wearing perfume. It's that strong. I'd be more likely to continue using this product if L'Oreal introduces an unscented version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was recently looking into getting a new face lotion and after I decided I was going to try L'Oreal, these products showed up in the mail. So far, I love the Day Lotion. I love that it has SPF 20 in it to protect my face. This was something that I was missing in my previous lotion. It leaves my face feeling super smooth and not greasy feeling, which is amazing. Not to mention the pump style container with a lid for easy packing. I would definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this cream has the best feeling on my skin and non greasy. My skin feels refreshed and hydrated. After I cleaning my face, I immediately applied this very lightly scented formula. Due to my allergies I was happy to see the fragrance wasn't over powering otherwisee I would keep sneezing. So far, so grateful! Thanks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Like so many other Americans out in the world, I struggle with staying moisturized. Only because I tend to hate the way lotion or moisturizers make me feel after applying with this product you're not left feeling oily greasy or like something is crawling on you. It leaves your skin feeling so silky and smooth. The cream blends right into your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was super excited to try this as Loreal is a favorite brand of mine. I will for sure be repurchasing this! It's perfect for daytime use. It doesn't have a weird texture like so many other lotions with SPF do. It also smells really lovely! I feel like my skin is so much smoother and visibly changed after using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I give this product 4 star. It does not feel grease and does not smell stinking. It works great on my skin and gives my skin smooth feeling. I feel younger and beautiful. It gives my face a glow and winkles less there. This my first time trying some for faces and trying to get better outlook on my life. Trying this product gives a good feeling I am on the right track. I told my friends and family about this product. They all want to Try this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Awful product! After 2 weeks of use my face has badly broken out in what appears to be some sort of rash! I have small red spots ALL OVER my face and it's so bad that I am considering seeing a dermatologist if it doesn't clear up. I have discontinued my use of this product.
"I absoutly loved this moisturizer! Speaking from someone with Oily, acne prone skin, this was a dream product to use! It soaked completely into my skin, leaving it soft and smooth and perfectly prepped for makeup! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how lightweight but super moisturizing this lotion is. It blends right in, but lasts all day. It also really helps improve those fine lines. I've been using it over 4 weeks now and I can tell that my complexion looks better. Definitely going to continue to use this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using RevitaLift® Triple Power™ Day Lotion Moisturizer SPF 20 for about a month and love that it keeps my skin feeling hydrated without being greasy or heavy. The SPF 20 is an added bonus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"folded right into my routine without causing any irritation or breakouts. i love the way that it primed my skin for makeup, gliding right over top. after repeated use, i definitely find that my mild sunspots are fading and i see an overall brighter look to my skin. i'm not suffering from any fine lines (yet) so i can't speak to the smoothing properties, but this is a really nice everyday moisturizer with salicylic acid – great for the breakout prone!

Great moisturizer. It absorbs quickly so that I can apply my makeup right away. It leaves my skin feeling seriously moisturized and gives it a nice glow. My skin feels smooth all day long regardless of how the weather is outside. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As a 37 year old with very dry skin who is worried about mottled brown spots, this daily moisturizer is perfect. An SPF is a must for me to keep away potential brown spots and the way this lightweight moisturizer/cream sinks right in is perfect for day wear. It has little to no scent and I love the pump function as opposed to annoying squeeze tubes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love this moisturizer - it goes on so easily and absorbs really well so that my skin isn't greasy. And it seems to actually be making a difference in my skin! My dark spots on my cheek have lightened up a little and the lines around my eyes aren't as pronounced anymore! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Revitalift worked well as a ""sunscreen"" product. It was absorbed fairly quickly, which is a real plus, if you're applying makeup on afterwards. I honestly think that maybe my skin was a little softer after using Revitalift, but I really saw no difference at all in my wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a very nice moisturizer with a great texture and mild scent...better than a lot of other moisturizers that I have tried. It' s not a miracle in a bottle, but I didn't expect it to be. In addition, I don't think it is ideal for oily skin types. It made my skin a bit too oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first thing I noticed about this product was the strong smell.....WAY too overpowering for my taste. If a non-scented product was offered, I would definitely be a regular consumer. Aside from that, I found it to be rehydrating and very simple to use. After the third week I did notice that several dark spots had faded a little and some wrinkles seem less creased.

"I have been using the Loreal Paris Revitalift Lotion for the past 3 weeks. it has left my skin soft and more refreshed working. I think maybe with time, i will see the benefit of lift in my skin. Overall is makes for a great moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Overall a good moisturizer with the SPF 20 protection that you need. I liked the non greasy feel. It was a light moisturizer that made applying to your skin easy and quick. I did see some improvement to my skin and would continue using this product to see if there was even more improvement. Thank you for sharing this product with me to try!

I received the Lorel Paris Revitalift Triple Power SPF 20 for free. The scent was a little overpowering for me as I have a very sensitive nose. The lotion went on very smooth but once it was on I didn't feel like it soaked in enough and kind of sat on the top of my skin like sunscreen does. It left my face shiny. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Triple Power(TM) SPF 20 Day Lotion from SheSpeaks and started using it immediately. I loved the scent and the non-greasy feel. I have combination skin and felt that it didn't moisturize the dry spots enough and I did have a pimple pop out. I liked the spf factor without it smelling like it contained it. I liked the bottle and will share it with my sister who doesn't have dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this product! It really worked well. I always wear sunscreen and this went on nice and smooth. Plus a lot of sunscreens irritate my skin but this one did not. In fact, it made my skin look better. I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Triple Power(TM) SPF 20 Day Lotion to try, and overall I'm pretty pleased with the product. I was happy to notice after a few weeks of use that several of my dark spots have faded, and I think my wrinkles are slightly less visible. However, I have oily skin, and this moisturizer is heavier than what I typically use. I would definitely recommend this product if you have dry to normal skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how Loreal Revitalift smoothed out any lines on my face. It faded out spots and imperfections on my face. I like that it has SPF 20 in the moisturizer. My face looks younger and smoother. This is my new moisturizer. I highly recommend others to try it for yourself and see the results! Amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved how smooth this went on my face. I noticed within a week a difference in the firmness of my skin. I felt the lines around my mouth were less noticeable as well. it is something I will buy and continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love it!! It has a fresh smell! It makes my skin feel soft and smooth. My skin didn't break out as it usually does with new products. I trust the L'Oreal brand and have used their products before, and have had much success in the area of protecting and moisturizing and age defense with the L'Oreal products! Another hit! I love it!!

I tried the spf 20 lotion for a month and I enjoyed the sun protection factor and it was lightweight. I liked the smell and I had no irritation. I did not see any imrovement in my fine lines or anti-aging benefits. But did like how it went well under my makeup and alone for sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the L'Oreal Revitalift Day Lotion as a free sample to try and review. The product has a nice smell and I experienced no irritation. The lotion kept my skin moisturized and I really liked the fact that it has an SPF of 20. I didn't see where the lotion caused my skin to appear any firmer or more youthful looking, but it's a nice facial moisturizer with sun protection and pleasant fragrance. I would recommend the product on those qualities alone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked L'Oreal RevitaLift® Triple Power? Day Lotion Moisturizer SPF 20 and worked with my sensitive skin. This moisturizer didn't have any smell like most cosmetics with SPF in it. It glided smoothly on skin and was really effective. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am always a fan of L'Oreal Paris Revitalift products. The L'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Triple Power SPF 20 Day Lotion did not disappoint. I really liked the texture of the lotion. It feels light on my face and goes on smoothly. The SPF was definitely a bonus, especially during these summer months. While it did not perform anti-aging miracles, it did leave my face feeling fresh and moisturized. The one downside was that I did not like the smell at all.

This Loreal lotion worked well on my face. It was light and quickly absorbed into my skin. There was a mild scent and the lotion did not irritate my skin. There was some improvement with my skin and it did appear younger with less noticeable lines but the spots did not fade. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product to try and was very satisfied with this results. I live in Texas and the heat and sun are really damaging to your skin. I'll have to say this product not only made my skin look and feel firmer but it protected my face from the harmful damage from the sun. My face looks a feels young again. I love it.

"L'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Triple Power(TM) SPF 20 Day Lotion is so very easy to use. Just a small squirt of lotion, rub it into your skin and you are set the rest of the day! Smooth coverage, great smell...very pleased with this product. I would definitely recommend it to my friends! Getting a free sample was a great bonus! Thanks L'Oreal for such a wonderful all in one product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Triple Power(TM) SPF 20 Day Lotion for the past month. I liked the texture of the product as well as the ease of use. I thought it did leave my skin very moisturized. I didn't see that much of a change in my dark spots though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Pluses - Silky texture, absorbs easily, didn't irritate my skin Minus - The smell was a bit strong. Overall, I liked this moisturizer. I didn't really see any difference between using this and using my usual anti-aging moisturizer, but that's probably a good thing since my usual product has a lot of the same great ingredients. I would have loved to have seen an improvement so I'm probably not going to switch, but I do think this is a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked the scent and how it moisturized my skin. My only issues were: too much came out of the pump and it doesn't absorb quickly. It kind of sits on your face all white and creamy. Non irritating and does what it says. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used the lotion every night before bed. It had a nice smell to it and wasn't too overpowering like other lotions. It went on smoothly and didn't have that oily feeling to it. It also made me skin feel soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to receive the Loreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion product in the mail. This product has a much stronger smell than my usual moisturizer which has SPF15. This product did moisturize my face nicely, but it did no more than my regular moisturizer-which I love(and it costs less than this moisturizer) and will continue using. Maybe better results come from using the whole line of products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This works really well as a moisturizer. Not too thick, but not too thin either. I love the added bonus of the SPF, since I wear that anyway I can skip a step. I have somewhat sensitive skin, and this did not bother my skin at all. I did not care for the scent, but it did not seem to last long. I haven't noticed any spots fading. But, since it works well as a moisturizer, I would still recommend this to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free sample of L'Oreal RevitaLift® Triple Power Day Lotion Moisturizer SPF 20, and have used it for a few weeks. I'm now 47, and one of my skin concerns is dark spots on my cheeks from the sun. I love that this not only has SPF, it helps fade the stubborn spots. I also notice a difference in the fine lines on my face. My face felt immediately smooth and soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the feel of the product on my skin but I had problems with the product getting into my eyes if I used it above my cheek bones. I made a concentrated effort to keep it away from my eyes but I sweat a lot at my job so it was hard to use daily. The results that I got were all that I expected. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I enjoyed using the lotion which I received for free. It was easy to dispense and absorbed quickly into my skin and had a pleasant smell. My skin felt softer and smoother after using it for just a week. My skin looked brighter and had a more even tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have rosacea and was concerned about the product leaving my face feel greasy and oily. The lightweight formula absorbed quickly and the fragrance was not overpowering. I also liked the added sunscreen protection. I noticed a difference with my overall skin appearance and age spots. Would recommend the product to my girls friends. Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to try L'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Triple Power(TM) SPF 20 Day Lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not sure if it is fair for me to review this item. It turns out I am allergic to one of the ingredients, so I was only able to use it for a few days before I had to stop. It had a nice dispenser, a pleasant smell, and it went on smoothly and easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like that this product has an spf in it. It is a nice consistency. It goes on smoothly and evenly. For me, it did feel a little greasy after application, but after it set and I applied makeup foundation and powder afterwards, it didn't seem greasy. It helped minimize fine lines around my eyes and lessened dark spots. Very nice product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall pretty good product. I have been using it daily for about a month, however I haven't really noticed any changes in my skin. It does keep even moisture throughout the day and I love that it has spf. So overall I have a favorable feeling about the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this product! I have tried a lot of different skincare products, especially sunscreens (a must-have for my extra-pale complexion!) and I really enjoyed using this lotion. I wasn't a huge fan of the fragrance (it wasn't bad, just strong for something worn on the face) but I loved the texture and how smooth my skin felt after applying the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this for approximately 5 weeks. The product smells nice, goes on smoothly, and absorbs right away. I saw no noticeable difference in the fine lines on my face. I did however notice a slight fading in the dark patches of skin that I have had for 7 years due to melasma. Bonus is my skin stays moisturized all day.

I love the Revitalift Triple Power Lotion! Every girl needs a sunscreen built into their moisturizer! It goes on smoothly and has a light pleasant scent. Keeps my skin protected and moisturized all throughout the year! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product goes on smoothly and is easily layered under my foundation. The SPF odor many times found in these products wasn't present. It is a good product for someone who doesn't have SPF in their foundation and need it for daily use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like this product a lot. At first, it feels a little heavy on your skin but once it dries it leave a smooth silky feel. I love that it has SPF included in lotion so I do not have to worry about applying a separate SPF to protect my face from the sun. The only reason I gave it a four is there is a fairly strong scent to the product. A little goes a long way so this bottle will last a long time making it a good value for the cost. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power(TM) SPF 20 Day Lotion is a amazing product, it worked so good on my skin. I applied it every morning and and it made my skin more firmer and brighter, and fine lines around my eye area is gone. It also has SPF 20 to protect skin from sun which is must have for me. The non grease formula is easy to use and applies smothely. I loved it and already bought more and I highly recommend it. #gotitfree. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really wanted to try this product to see if it worked as well as they say. I was pleased with the results. No big improvement to deep wrinkles but fine lines were diminished and skin looked softer and more hydrated. I used it each morning and didnt have any problems with my sensitive skin breaking out. I have bought another bottle and love the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This summer I've been doing a lot of work in my flower garden and, while I love getting a little sun, at my age I have to be very careful of how much I get on my face. I was so happy to have the chance to try L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion. A small amount kept my face both protected and moisturized even when sweating and working hard. I love the look of my skin while using it and plan to continue applying it daily. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first the scent was a little strong, but now I love it! I have noticed my little fine wrinkles seem to have toned up. YAY!! I have even had people say how young I look...being 41..I absolutely love being told that! I have one dark spot on my face that has seemed to lighten up. That is a definite plus. The only thing, it burned a slight bit when I would go out in the sun. I have very very fair skin though. I will continue to use L Oreal Paris RevitaLift! It's 5 stars for me!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Five stars! 1) It smells SO good. Not like any other sunscreen I've used. 2) It works VERY well. I used it prior to being out in the blazing sun in a kayak for three hours. I never even reapplied, and my skin was protected the whole time. My fair skin didn't show any signs of pink. 3) It moisturizes my skin without feeling greasy, and soaks in well enough so that my face doesn't look shiny. 4) I recommended it to my husband, and now he's using it, too.

I really enjoyed using the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift every day. It made my skin feel nourished and moisturized. I also liked the fact that I didn't have to put a separate sunscreen on. It wasn't too perfumy and it went on easily. I like the little pump that it comes in but I'm sure there will be some left in the bottom that I am going to have to figure out how to get to lol!

"I think I would have liked the l'oreal revitalift moisturizer more during the winter. I used this during the summer and it felt greasy, during the winter I think it would have felt more protective. On the plus side I noticed a lightening of sun spots, on the minus side it seemed to make my pores look bigger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't to familiar with L'Oréal skincare products. When i got to try the moisturizer, I fell in love with it. It's very lightweight, and non greasy. It reduced my pores, softened fine lines, and brightened my skin. I love that it protects against the sun also. Living in California, there is nothing but sun!

I used the product for about 4 weeks. I didn't really like the consistency of the of the cream. The scent was nice. I didn't really notice any difference in my skin after using this product. Maybe you have to use it longer to see any difference. I did break out a bit and I never have trouble with with my skin breaking out. Not sure if it was the product . I did like the sun protection that it provides. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"It was a bit oily to me for summer time. I did not like the feeling after putting on my makeup. I ended up switching back to other bland I was using, and it felt so much better with make up. I might be able to use this product during winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great day lotion! After using a couple weeks I could see a difference in the appearance of my skin. If felt softer, not as rough textured. It felt smoother and I think wrinkles were less visible.

"This Revitalift Day Lotion was very good. It was not sticky or goopy, and went on smooth. It had a pleasant smell and the SPF worked great. i spent several days out in the sun and ( usually get burned ) and it helped tremendously. I could wear makeup over it without feeling like i had tons of stuff on my face. I would recommend to anyone... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found the L'Oreal Revitalift with SPF moisturized my skin without being too greasy. It also provided adequate protection from the sun. All in all, I didn't find it to be anything special. The scent wasn't pleasant (to me) and I didn't find that it helped my wrinkles, fine lines or the texture of my skin. For a facial sun screen, it is fine. But, for help with skin concerns that come with age, it was nothing special. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer felt so amazing..there was no greasy feeling at all when applying it, my skin soaked it right in immediately.

"I enjoyed sampling L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power SPF 20 Day Lotion. However, I would not purchase the item as I am not confident that it was absorbed in to my skin properly. It was thick going on my skin. I did not see any skin improvements in over 3 weeks of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Triple Power(TM) SPF 20 Day Lotion This product is lightly scented and quickly absorbed, no dewey feeling. Although I would like a higher SPF, this product is great for everyday protection but to my surprise it also did very well in the sun. I was very impressed after being on a boat and in the lake for several hours, I had no signs of facial redness. My skin does feel smoother and lines are less noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power I thought it was just ok. I like the sun protection that it gives but did not care for the smell. It did go on nicely and wasn't greasy. I didn't notice a difference as far as helping the fine lines and wrinkles. My skin doesn't seem any brighter. If you are looking for sun protection this is good but I feel I would have to use it a little longer to see if it really helps wrinkles and brightens the skin.

"After using L'Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Power SPF 20 Day Lotion, I am confident that I will continue to use it. I use this lotion before applying my makeup. It goes on easily and absorbs into my skin quickly. It is not greasy and has light scent that is not overwhelming. I like the fact that this is a broad spectrum sunscreen and it also has ingredients that helps fight wrinkles and makes my skin feel and look smoother.

"Another product that doesn't do what it claims. It wasn't too oily, absorbed quickly, and made my skin feel softer. I wasn't very fond of the scent. It smelled artificial. The product was great as a sunscreen, but it did nothing for hyperpigmentation, fine lines or wrinkles. I guess I'll be looking for a product that actually does that forever. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very excited to test this product because I love other L'Oreal Revitalift products. As a sunscreen, this product worked very well. It went on a bit greasy but rubbed in well and felt light on my skin. Also, I did not have any burning issues while using this product. However, the scent reminds me of suntan lotion from my childhood (not necessarily a good thing). As a facial moisturizer, I really didn't notice any softening of fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a couple weeks into the trial and am not impressed. As others have said, there is no strong smell which I like. It feels greasy going on, but absorbs very quickly. To the touch my skin feels soft after use. It however does not feel nourished. I have noticed a slight improvement in fine lines, but would not continue to use. My skin feels too dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Nice moisturizer but didn't deliver on labeling. My fine lines, wrinkles and hyper-pigmentation look exactly the same as before using the product. When this runs out I'll be going back to Clinique CityBlock for less cost and higher SPF. I have sensitive skin and dislike the smell of most sunblocks. I can say that none of the L'Oreal sunblocks have that unpleasant smell and none irritate my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is very high quality. I loved that it protects my skin better with a higher SPF than my usual cream. It is a good consistency and easy to apply. The pump makes it very practical to apply. It made my skin feel tighter and very well moisturized, without feeling greasy. I did not have any adverse reaction and will continue to use it because it looks better after using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm usually a little skeptical about trying facial products since my skin can be sensitive to them. But I loved this product - it was easy to apply and after a few days my skin appeared to be more youthful and radiant ! I even received compliments from friends and family ! I will definitely continue using this product and may even add an additional product to me facial regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I thought this product was good for my face. It was a great consistency and a little went a long way. No problem with a smell, and there was no bad reactions with my skin or other makeup.

"I liked that I only had to use a small amount to cover my entire face. It went on smoothly and was not greasy under my makeup. The odor was ok, not too offensive.

"I was so happy when i received my free sample of L'Oréal Paris Revitalift® Triple Power™ SPF 20 Day Lotion! I tend to break out easily with facial products so i was also a bit leery.

I have been looking for a day lotion with SPF that doesn't make my skin feel greasy and weighed down and this one is a contender! The lotion goes on smooth and my skin feels soft and supple all day long. It felt light and absorbed into my skin quickly. My only complaint is that I haven't noticed any change in my skins appearance since I've been using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wow! Love this moisturizer! Smells amazing and feels so rich and creamy on my face! It did a good job of helping rid me of some of my fine lines and wrinkles. I think the more I use it, the better I will look! I used one pump per application and it made my skin feel really great. The only down side is that you don't know how much is left in the container since it's a red bottle. That's not a deal breaker though ;) I will definitely be using this product in the future. It's wonderful!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After 4 weeks of use, my skin appears firmer and wrinkles seem a bit smoother. The initial change I saw was that my skin became more hydrated and felt less dry when devoid of any lotions or creams. I used it on my neck whenever I remembered and it seemed to smooth my neck skin out also as well as tightening it. I liked the soft smell of the lotion. It was lightweight and dissipated quickly when applied. Would definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product daily and unfortunately I found it left my face very greasy and I ended up with an increase in acne break outs. I did find my skin more soft, but the trade off wasn't worth it. The spf protection worked great, I ride a motorcycle and didn't need to apply any additional sun block protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like how easy it is to use the pump to get the product from the bottle. I did use 2 pumps to cover my face and neck . Never forget my neck. The product was the right thickness and spreads well. It absorbed quickly. i didn't care too much for the scent but it didn't last so no problems there. I think my skin looks better after the 4 week trial. I will continue to buy this product. I really like how my skin looks . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I found out I liked this sunscreen better than I thought I would. Very easy to apply. Did not make my skin oily or shiny. There is a slight scent to the product and it was pleasant.

"The lotion was a great consistency and absorbed well. It didn't make my face greasy which is important in the South during the summer. I didn't like the perfume scent, for facial moisturizer I don't like added scents. My face was hydrated and the sunscreen is a must. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't expect to like this moisturizer as as much as I have. It goes on effortlessly and doesn't require much. One pump is usually too much. It soaks up fast and has a nice feel, not too greasy. I didn't notice a difference in clearing up the discoloration on my face but then again I have pretty extensive amount due to acne scarring. I will continue to use it though to see because I like it.

I did not notice any wrinkle reduction or lightening of age spots. Irritating to my skin some days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As a fan of L Oreal products I was excited to try this out! I liked the easy pump dispenser and it comes right out smoothly. I was pleasantly surprised that the scent was not overpowering or too strong. Application was very easy and smooth and did not leave my skin feeling sticky or heavy. Being fair skinned this is a really good product for me use! I am hoping over time it will actually smooth out the lines and minimize the dark spots!

L 'oreal Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion works extremely well. I live is the high desert and my skin craves moisture. Moisture is needed everyday twice a day. With L'Oreal skincare my skin looks young nourished and plumped- up. I used this product everyday and fine lines were less. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall I liked L'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Triple Power SPF 20 Day Lotion. It feels very smooth and not greasy. It absorbs quickly and does not feel heavy. I was concerned a little bit about the scent, it is pleasant but a touch overpowering. I liked the pump applicator and that the lotion has SPF built in. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using this right away. It smells great and is easy to apply. I have not yet noticed a difference in my spots or wrinkles. It keeps my skin moisturized and I will continue to use because of that and the SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is a pleasure to use. It is dispensed through a easy to use pump. A little goes a long way. I really like the scent and the fact that it is not too thick. Application was very easy and smooth. I did not experience any sticky feel as I do with some sun screen products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love the pump dispenser! The cream is so smooth going on and rubs in with no sticky residue. I do notice fine lines are looking smoother. It doesn't irritate the skin at all. Love the way my makeup blends in after using the cream. a [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the pump applicator, one pump delivers the exact right amount for my whole face. The lotion has a good consistency and is not too thin or too thick. It absorbs well without making my skin greasy or tacky. I love that it moisturizes and has spf 20, though wish it were higher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very excited to try this product. Almost all of my expectations were met. I loved knowing that each day I had sunscreen on my face. The scent was great and the texture of the face cream was silky and smooth. I was happy that it wasn't greasy and didn't leave my face greasy. They only benefit I didn't see was a change in the wrinkles on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked the product. It was easy to apply and had very little fragrance. You only need a little to apply on your whole face. I liked the product under my makeup. It absorbed quickly and didn't feel heavy or greasy. I didn't really see a change in wrinkles or spots during the test period. I probably will continue to use it as a sunscreen. Thanks for allowing me to try it ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love, love, love this product! I was hesitant to try something new on my face. Always am because I am worried about a bad skin reaction. This product smells great, goes on smoothly and leaves my skin feeling wonderful! I definitely recommend this product and will keep it in my arsenal =) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't sure how I was going to like this product. I've used another brand for years. But, I gave it a try and love it! It has a great smell -- not too overpowering. It goes on very smoothly. I only really needed one full pump to cover my whole face and neck. It soaks in nicely and does not leave my face feeling greasy. I would definitely buy this product again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like feel of this lotion on my face. It's doesn't have a greasy feel and I like that it has sunscreen for when I am outdoors. I live in the desert and have very dry skin. Using this lotion, my skin feels soft for a change. I don't notice that my dark spots on my face have faded which I thought it was suppose to do. It has a light scent which I like. Overall I will buy this product again and try the serum as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"it's nice! Fragrance is very pleasant, lotion goes on nice and smooth and blends easily. I could use a little more moisturizing power so I doubt this would be enough for me during the winter months. The pump is awesome! It dispenses just the right amount of product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this L'oreal Revitalift Triple Power for a few weeks now. I put it on after my morning cleaning routine. I reapplied when I was going to be outdoors for any length of time. Goes on smooth without any oily feel. My face feels soft and refreshed. Helps with early skin aging caused by the sun over time. I would recommend this product for every day use to protect your skin from the aging effects of the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall, I liked the product. My main concerns with any lotion are the ""perfuminess"" and whether it leaves my skin feeling greasy (and looking shiny). This one definitely had a scent, but it wasn't unpleasant or overpowering to me. The lotion absorbed quickly and didn't leave my skin feeling greasy. I didn't have any breakouts. Unfortunately, I did not see any changes in the dark spots on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the smell of it and the way it felt on my face. I don't feel like I have used it long enough to see a difference. I did actually use it more in the evening than in the morning as I like moisturizers at night more. All in all, I liked the product I got and would recommend to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like how this product wasn't too thick and didn't make my skin feel too greasy. My skin feels softer and the lines under my eyes are just a touch smoother. I have combination skin and had to apply extremely thinly still on my oily sections but I did not break out at all from this product, which is great.

I'm a busy grandma and I don't take enough time to take care of my skin. I found using L Oreal Paris RevitaLift Triple Protection was easy! It gave me the moisturizer I needed and the sunscreen to protect my face in one application. It did make a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Since I began using the Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion Moisturizer, I have notice fading of the dark spots on my face and a smoother complexion. The sunscreen protection also seemed to help during my summer aqua-zumba classes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product has a pleasant scent and a nice consistency. A little goes a long way and absorbs completely without leaving a residue that sometimes happens with thicker lotions. I personally have not seen any results or lightening of darker patches on my face. It may be due to the fact that I'm using this product during summertime when I'm outdoors every day. I would use this product as a moisturizer only. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am pleased with this product. The scent is light and pleasant and it does not take much product to cover my entire face. It absorbs very quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft. The SPF 20 is effective, but I haven't noticed any elimination of fine lines and dark spots yet, but i am hoping with continued use, that will happen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the consistency of the lotion not too thick not to watery or thin. The fragrance was a bit too overpowering . It felt smooth on my skin easy to use and to apply. Liked the pump application just afraid that when there's only a little left it will not come out. My skin started to feel dry as the day went on thought that was odd. would buy this product if the scent was not as strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I found this product very light and the scent was not heavy or overpowering. I used it every morning after my shower and it goes on smooth and absorbs very quickly with no greasy residue. A little goes a long way so I expect this bottle will last a long time. I didn't notice any reduction in wrinkles but I really liked how moisturizing it absorbed so nicely that my skin was not left oily. I would recommend this product as a great daily moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product has a nice smell and is not greasy at all. It is a good product to use before makeup application. I was also pleasantly surprised that it did not make me break out. I did not notice any improvement in wrinkles or dark spots though. I also wish it moisturized more. I am noticing my face is looking dry. But as a sunscreen, it's great.

"Cream was light and effective. My skin stayed protected, even on vacation in Jamaica. My skin tone has evened out, and scars are less visible. Excellent product, skin looks younger, fuller, and more even. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Every time I use the lotion, I am pleasantly surprised by how nice it smells. I also like that the lotion is light and just a small amount provides full coverage. The SFP 20 really works! One sunny day, my arms got sunburned, but not my face. Sure wish I had applied the lotion on my arms as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product from Loreal, and it surprised me that it was very efficient! The texture of this serum is absorbed by the skin quickly and I like that. Leaves skin smooth, and it helped me eliminate fine lines. Puffiness went down as well, will buy after my sample is gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did like how this product felt going on. It wasn't too greasy and it seemed to rub in really well. It also had a great smell. I have sensitive skin and it hasn't seem to have irritated it at all. It moisturizes very well. It's a very nice product all around. I do recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked it a lot. I liked the consistency, it is not at all oily or heavy. I liked that it is SPF20. My skin looks and feels great and my dark spots are lighter after using it for only 4 weeks. I did not like that if you were not careful a whole lot of product would come out so I had to be extra careful. I am used to serums that usually just dispense about a pea size. That is the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Would definitely recomend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My lines and wrinkles look the same but I really like how it feels when it goes on. Not too thick and not too thin. I also like that the scent is so light because I can get headaches from heavily scented products. I love that it is SPF 20. You can't be too careful. I will keep using it to see if any lines and wrinkles will hopefully get better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like L'Oreal's Revitalift Triple Power Day Lotion Moisturizer. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth yet not greasy and protects it from sun damage. I have enjoyed trying it out and would recommend it to other 50 somethings :0) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product! I've been using it for three weeks. It feels soft on my skin and I have not had any breakouts or redness or rash from the ingredients. I am not fond of the scent but alot of products with UV protection have some kind of scent to them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using Aveeno positively radiant daily moisturizer for years so was a little skeptical to try this new product but boy do I just love it . It goes on so smooth and the smell is just so wonderful and my sensitive skin has not had any breakouts. And the SPF works just great last me all day. I think I will be changing my product. Very Very pleased. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love that L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power has a SPF 20 in it as sunscreen is very important to me. I liked the texture and that it is not greasy at all. However after having a few pores clogged the first week I had to make sure to use a astringent at night and I did not see any results on the fine lines or a difference in discoloration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was a bit skeptical at first but this product won me over. I loved the way it felt on my skin - very lightweight and not at all greasy. I could wear it under my makeup with no problem at all. I like that it has a sunscreen in it to further protect my skin from damage. As far as wrinkles go, I think some of the fine lines look less pronounced. I will definitely continue to use it to see how much more it can improve and protect my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've seen a positive improvement after using this product and will continue to use it. It did not make me look 20 years old again but I am impressed at how well it worked after a short amount of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can't really see any improvement with my fine lines. I used this daily and was hoping for better results. For some reason I had quite a few pimples on my forehead while using it as well, which I don't normally experience. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do not usually wear a sun screen which I know is bad. I received a free product sample of this to use in exchange for my review just in time for my heavy summer gardening month. I found this product to go on easily in the morning and provide protection all day from the sun as well as helping to smooth fine lines and wrinkles. I thought the product was a great thickness, and had a very pleasant scent. I will be buying this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Love, Love, Love this, this Loreal Paris Revitalift, it feels so refreshing and also has a great smell to it, the formula isn't to thick or too thin, it is just right.

I receive this product in return to write my honest review. I really liked using this everyday. It really made a different in my skin. I was very pleased with the results and would continue using this product as well as recommend it to my friends. It didn't have a hasty smell and didn't leave my skin greasy.

"I love the SPF 20 in this lotion. I have been using it for about 3 weeks. Its light and creamy, not greasy. I put it on in the morning before my makeup. I love the one pump dispenser that gives just the right amount. I love L'Oreal products, especially their skin care. My face is soft and smooth. I havent seen a change in aging, wrinkles or firming, but it's only been 3 weeks. I will continue using the entire bottle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have extremely dry skin and I apply this product in the morning and it last through-out the day. I spend a lot of time outdoors in the elements and it holds up very well. It does reduce the wrinkles and firms my skin. My face feels much softer since I started using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like this product. It is starting to work on my face. I have been using it everyday and it works good. I am starting to see results of using this product. I will keep using this product for a while. It is evening out my skin tone. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power SPF 20 Day Lotion for a few weeks now. The consistency of the lotion is nice and I like that it has some SPF in it. I thought that the scent of it was a little strong and glad that it eventually faded away. I wanted to see if it would fade some of the sun spots that I already have and did not notice a difference in the spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Cream. I live in South Florida and the summers here are such a torture.

"Thank you She Speaks and Loreal for the sample. I love Loreal Paris Revitalift , it makes my face feel so good.. my face seems to have a smoother appearance, with less wrinkles and my age spots are slowly disappearing! IIt makes my face feel so much better. Friends are telling me I look good, which hasn't happened in years. It's not greasy and provides sunscreen as well. Thank you for this opportunity, I will be looking for it in stores to buy when this runs out :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the convenience of having some sunscreen in a day cream. The weight of the cream feels just right for summer on drier skin. However, in the winter, I would prefer a heavier day cream for a base and then use a foundation with sunscreen. The scent lingers; I prefer little/no scent.

"I received thisL'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Triple Power(TM) SPF 20 Day Lotion free in exchange for an honest review. I have some Sun spots on my face and I didn't really notice them fading, I like that it's SPF 20, it's a little thicker than I expected, the smell was on the masculine side in my opinion. Overall it made my face smooth but I also get that with every moisturizer that are better smelling than this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the lightweight formula and how easily it absorbed into my skin. I have quite a few sun spots and this product seemed to lighten them up. I also find the light Fragance to be pleasant and it doesn't interfere with my other scented products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I wasn't sure if this was intended to be a day cream or a sunscreen. It said Sunscreen but was presented like a day cream. It went on and felt like a sunscreen. It worked OK for summer use, but I would want something a bit heavier in the winter months. However, it did feel a bit greasy - but not sure if that was the lotion or the humidity. I didn't care for the smell. I didn't notice a difference in my skins appearance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how it feels on my skin. It isn't too heavy, but it really works. I've noticed my skin feels firmer and some sun spots have lightened up. I will definitely keep using it and would recommend it to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great product. It has a pleasant, clean fragrance, not too heavy. It goes on smoothly and is very lightweight. My face did not feel greasy at all after applying it. It also works well, I was out on the pool deck for about 4 hours with it on and it worked beautifully without me having to reapply it. I will definitely purchase this product as long as it does not cost an arm and a leg! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I couldn't use this for very long...the scent was WAY to strong and gave me a headache each time I applied it. I did like how easily it went on, and felt light on my skin. It made my skin feel very soft and not weighed down. If you can get beyond the stronger scent, I think it would be a good product to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am very happy with the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift® Triple Power(TM) SPF 20 Day Lotion so far. It goes on smooth and is not greasy at all. A small amount goes a long way and I like that it doesn't make my face break out from the daily use. I have noticed some differences but am hoping to see more results with longer use. So far so good- great new product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This feels rather thick when getting it out of the container. However, it was easy to smooth out so it was a thin and light application to the face. It did not leave skin feeling oily. Regular makeup applied afterwards stayed on throughout the day. This will be an addition to my morning routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really oily skin, so I approach each new skin product with caution. I was pleased to find out that it had the same top three active ingredients as my current moisturizer, but was less heavy feeling on my skin. I noticed my T zone was less shiny using this too. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm on the fence about L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power. I don't see any difference after using daily but have to wonder if: It's been enough time. Is my skin to damaged to be repaired Does this product repair or appear to repair. I will update review @ 6 week mark. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i really like the fact that this product has an spf of 20, especially since I've been outside a lot this summer. I have noticed that my skin is smoother and the tone is more even. I haven't noticed a huge change in my fine lines, but there is a slight improvement . Overall, I would recommend this product and will continue to use it.

"I have been trying this new L'Oreal product and am very happy with it. I have not used a L'Oreal moisturizer in a long time and this makes me want to go back to using their moisturizers. It's very smooth and silky going on the skin and it gives it a nice, baby soft feel when it's on. Not heavy at all or greasy. I have combination skin and was worried about using it on the oily areas but it was no issue at all. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this stuff. It is so addicting. It goes on smooth and rich. It feels so rich on your skin like silk. My skin looks great. It isn't as dry as it used to be and has this glowing sheen on it. Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved using this product. Full disclosure: I already use revitalift night cream. Compared to other face creams, I felt like I need to use less of this since it didn't absorb as quickly. That also forced me to rub it in longer, which I think was good! Loved that it had 20 spf. I tend to have some dry areas, and my skin felt better after using it for a week. I liked the scent and the feel of the cream. I'll definitely buy it when mine runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unfortunately, I was unable to use this product for more than a few days. The chemical sunscreen ingredients in it caused me to have an allergic reaction to the product. For the days I did use it, I felt the product did not feel too heavy or greasy, smelled alright, and absorbed easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I truly loved the L'Oreal Revitalift Triple Power day Lotion. After applying , my face feels so smooth and silky. I loved that it contains SPF 20 and it allows for my foundation to go over really evenly. I would highly recommend this product to any of my friends.

"I thought the packaging was great! I like that you do not have sunscreen all over your hands after you apply it. It's 1.7 oz and can easily be taken through airport security. What I could not stand was the scent. It was very strong and seemed to linger long after you applied it . It smelled like hairspray to me. I stopped using it after the first week. Yes, I would recommend if you can get past the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oréal Paris Revitalift® Triple Power SPF 20 Day Lotion was a sumptuous treat!! I loved the fragrance and saw a difference in my skin tone. It was luminous! I only gave it four stars because SPF 20 is not enough for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer was okay. Sunscreen is a must in my daily routine, and I like that this moisturizer has it, but I would've preferred a higher spf. Also, the fragrance was pleasant but lingered. I would've preferred it to be unscented. I don't think that I have used it long enough to notice a difference in the fading of spots, repairing of wrinkles or the smoothing of fine lines.

"I got to try out this moisturizer for free thanks to SheSpeaks, and it's one of my faves. I've been a Revitalift fan for ages! It's a great all day moisturizer with SPF protection that doesn't feel greasy. It works awesome under makeup, and has a really great smell to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product absorbs into my skin very quickly. It doesn't leave a greasy feeling and I feel protected because of the SPF 20 all day long. The smell is a little too floral for me which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. I would prefer a more citrus smell or no smell at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product. First it's Very creamy with out being Greasy. one pump is enough to do my face and neck and it absorbs quickly. I noticed a Difference in the moisture of my skin. And even the fine lines around my Eyes are less noticeable. I really like having a sunscreen and Moisturizer in one, it's one less thing to do in m Busy morning routine.

L'Oréal Paris Revitalift® Triple Power™ SPF 20 Day Lotion is great! My skin is softer and smoother than ever before. I have seen a drastic reduction in the appearence of fines lines on my face.

"Might have given it a 4, but for the perfume smell. Nice lightweight moisturizer. Pumps out enough for face, neck, decolletage, and hands. Bit too much in one pump. It didn't work fantastically, but didn't expect it to. Lightened dark spots a bit, nice moisturization. Did I mention I hated the smell... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After about 2 weeks of use, this product is now a staple of my daily routine. I love the fragrance but more than that, my skin is noticeably smoother than before I started using this. I usually can feel bumps/pores when I touch my face, but this seems to have made my skin smoother! I also love that the sunscreen is included. My only reason for giving it 4 stars is that I am not sure if it is reducing any wrinkles yet! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I love the Revitalift Triple Power Hydration Lotion. It is great that it can serve as a moisturizer and as a sunscreen. I love the scent and how it makes my skin smooth.

"I've been using this product for 2 weeks and so far, so good. I think the concept of combining a moisturizing with SPF makes great sense. It is easy to apply and I don't feel it leaves a greasy feeling. Tough to say whether it is reducing lines or discoloration on my face -- not sure if will clear up what is already there or just help prevent lines from deepening or having new ones form. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far I like this product. I especially like that it is formulated with SPF 20 which makes me feel protected. I find the smell to be a bit strong, but it does fade away quickly. The lotion does leave me a little on the greasy side, but if I blot my skin during the day, this keeps the oil away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product, but can't use it around my eyes because it caused red puffy bumps! I am still using it on my forehead, jawline and neck. It smells great, is non-greasy, effective in reducing wrinkles and moisturizing my skin. I wish I could use it all over, but the delicate skin around my eyes is too sensitive. I hope Loreal comes up with a similar product for sensitive skin or just an eye cream that I could use!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to try this product. The consistency is great, feels smooth on my face, not greasy, overall really liked it except...my eyes are itching and watering non-stop. I've been careful not to put it too close to my eyes, using it the same way I used a very similar product of a different brand. The itching and watering stopped once I stopped using the product. Very disappointed as I like a lot of things about the product and want to be able to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product scores 5 stars because it gives the ultimate results with a reasonable cost! Love the way it feels!
"I'm only 34 and already developing some some some age spots/dark spots- this product obviously protect my skin from further sun damage with the SPF, but also actually faded some of these age spots over time."
