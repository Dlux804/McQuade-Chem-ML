I started using this product and within two days I saw results. My face and neck were significantly lighter. This product lightened my sun spots and skin discolorations. This serum is smooth and non-greasy I feel like it made me look years younger. #review #freeforreview [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am so happy to have tried this product. Not only does it feel great after applying but it has a nice light pleasing smell. It goes on evenly and smooth and does exactly what I expected it to. I have some uneven skin spots and wanted to start correcting them. This product did not disappoint. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using it under my eyes and around my mouth and I can tell a difference after 2 months of use. I received this product as a sample and I will definitely purchase next time. You only need a little bit, so it last a very long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My age is finally catching up to me and I have started developing dark spots on my face. I used the skin lighting serum as directed and it made me look at least 5 years younger. The dark spots are almost completely gone and my skin looks much brighter and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Pureaty Natural Skin Lightening Cream is what every reluctantly freckle faced gal needs. Over all I have noticed a brightening of my over all skin tone. And a fading of the freckles across the nose bridge cheek area. The formula is light and non-greasy. It absorbs readily into the skin without drying gummy or tacky. It feels light and moisturizing, a very pleasant skin feel. I can't wait to see further changes as I use the product longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Lotion did not irritate skin, not enough time yet to tell if really lightens or not. Most products like this are too intense & burn as soon as you put them on, but this never did. I will keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the pureauty skin lightening serum for a couple weeks now. It has a light refreshing sent. And the product blends into your skin easy. Not heavy on your skin. I did feel that the product did make my skin a bit lighter. However I did not notice a huge change in the lighting of my skin but it felt more plump and moisturized. I feel with continued use i would notice more of a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Have a few dark spots that I have been using this serum to lightening them just a bit. After a few weeks of use I can notice the difference in the areas on my face. The lightening serum has reduced the color difference and made my dark spots almost vanish. Would recommend this product after a few weeks of trying it out.

I have several dark spots on my face. One big on in the middle of my forehead. I used my skin lightening serum twice a day for the last 3 weeks. You can still see my dark spots but they are not as dark. It does leave your skin feeling soft and smooth after every use. It does not feel tacky on your skin.

I was surprised by the results as I was initially skeptical. I have noticed the rest of my face became more ""glowy."" I love that the product is made up of natural ingredients and is not fragranted. I would highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have some dark spots on my cheeks I developed from stress. I bought this product to help lighten it. I have only used the product for about 10 days and it seems to help. Although the dark spots are not gone in their entirety I hope with continuous use it will be.
Im really enjoying this stuff. I do it it twice a day and have been for 4 weeks now. My skin is looking brighter and more even. Also due to being consistent with it means my skin is moisturized all day! Definitely recommend if you have freckles from sun damage like i do.
I started using this product this morning. I have Atopic Dermatitis and the medicine use leave dark spots on my skin. So I am using it to even out my skin color from the spots I get. You only need a little. I have sensitive skin and was able to use it. It has a light smell to it. Can not wait to see how while it will lighten my dark spots.
"Definitely seeing some lightening after using for a couple of weeks and that's only been once a day. Nice consistency, easy to use. Happy with the results."
I really like this cream. I use it on my face as moisturizer and it has really started to even out my skin color and leaves my skin so soft. I would difinitely recommend wether for skin lightening or just a good moisturizer.
"Have been using for over a month and very satisfied with the product. Not sure how it works with dark spots, but it has really evened my skin tone."
So far this product has really helped lighten skin spots on my face. I use it once a day. It doesn't get greasy under makeup which is nice.
Just started using the product about a week ago and can see improvement with some spots on my hands.
No!! It did nothing to help fade my dark spot...total waste of money. No i wont buy again!!!
Works great! Definitely see a difference after using this product.
"Nice serum. Goes on easily and leaves my fave feeling moisturized. Iâve noticed lightening in some darker spots, which pleases me. Great product!"

I used this on a dark spot on my arm from an oven burn. It did seem to lighten the area. I would definitely recommend this product.
