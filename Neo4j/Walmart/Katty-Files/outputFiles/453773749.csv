"I have very sensitive skin and am very weary of trying face products. This line of products has been great! I love the moisturizer. Its soothing and leaves my skin feeling moist rather than clogged from a thick cream! It does not make my skin extra oily like other ""acne"" products."

"This cream is so light that a little goes a long way. It does not leave my skin feeling greasy (which tends to happen with a lot of other products) and it does not dry it out either. My husband asked me after I first started using it what smelled so amazing. After a couple weeks use I can definitely see a difference in the appearance of my skin, it looks healthier. I'm a fan and will continue to purchase. Highly recommend!"
I love this cream. I've been using this cream for 3 days now and I am beginning to see a difference in my adult acne and rosacea. I use this cream along with a sulfur oint. that I use for my rosacea. I used the scrub but I had to send it back. Because my face is so hyper sensitive the scrub was too harsh. The cream has a minty smell and tingles a bit but that all goes away after a bit. I would highly recommed this product. Oh I've been using this 2x a day sometimes 3x a day. Thank you for a great product.!!!
"This is literally the best thing to touch my face all year. Within a week, my trouble spots were gone and skin was significantly more calm. I've had it for about a month now and it looks barely used so it looks like it will last me a long time too..which is a huge bonus! I have awful hormonal acne and also adult acne-it's nice to finally find something that works for both and makes me feel and look like I'm actually 28 and not a 13 year old pizza face. (Sorry for the analogy but I totally was one)"
"I have hormonal acne and even though this can't prevent it, it heals it up really fast. I've also noticed the pain associated with the cystic pimples is diminished. This isn't harsh and I use it all the time even when I'm not currently experiencing a break out. It is very moisturizing and not drying at all. I have had the same container 7 months now and have only used about 1/2 and I use it everyday."
"I have only been using this for a short time now but I have started to see a difference in my skin. A positive difference, in the fact that it is bringing the white heads to the surface and clearing up my pores. But at the same time leaving my face hydrated. I will definitely purchase more of this cream."
I'm a guy in my mid 30s and have had adult acne my entire adult life. I've tried it all from expensive subscriptions to prescriptions. Let's say I've taken a 20 year journey to finally find a product that truly works. I use the face wash and this face cream and haven't had a zit since starting about a month ago. Booyah!
"Almost immediately my skin relaxed. Redness was reduced and the number of breakouts have reduced... And I'm just about to have my period, so that's a huge improvement for me."
"I love the acne eliminating face cream because it helps control my oily skin with jojoba oil. In addition, it moisturizes and fights acne on my face. I would give it a 5/5 because it is the best acne face cream I have tried."
The product arrived much faster than expected. I have only used it two times so far. It does feel nice on my skin and not to oily. So far so good. Oh smells nice too.
"I love this tea tree oil product. I put it on before I go to bed every night and every morning I wake up my skin is clearer. I even started using it on dry skin, ingrown hairs, scars and any other ailments. Great find!"
It works very well in combination with the skin cleanser. It has helped to reduce breakouts.
Works great for hormonal acne; keeps skin hydrated but healthy. Best moisturizer I've tried in years.
Many other acne treatments dried out my skin but treeactive was effective and the peppermint in it felt very soothing.
I don't know how it works but it does. I have been using the face cream every day and my skin has never been so clear for so long.
"Undoubtedly the best acne cream I've used, and I'm 21 years old. Really helped clear up my skin"
This cream is amazing. A little goes a long way and really helps keep my skin looking its best.
I love Treeactiv products for my self and my daughter. They work with no harsh chemicals.
