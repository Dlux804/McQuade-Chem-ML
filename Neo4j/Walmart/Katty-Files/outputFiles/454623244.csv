"I've been using this for about a week now - putting a thin layer under my moisturizer (day and night). I have noticed a difference! It seems to give my moisturizer (Rapid Wrinkle Repair) a ""boost."" If I didn't live in such a dry climate, I probably wouldn't need it. It's nice on its own, as well - very soothing, and absorbs quickly. Typically products like this feel a little ""tacky;"" not this one!"
I purchased this product a few weeks ago in order to test some products out for my patients. I have been using it to my face consistently every morning and night. My face looks supple and refreshed. It's as if my face is getting a drink of water!
"I just bought this and it is very nice. I am so glad there are more options in the Hydro Boost line. I use morning and at bedtime. It adds an extra hydrating boost. If you have a little left after application, your hands will love this too."
"I bought this sometime last month and when I got it & used it for the first time ever. It made me skin soft, hydrated and energized. I love this product"
I just bought this and I loved the way my skin felt when I first put it on. It's so refreshing and silky.
"I have started using the hydro boost multivitamin booster a couple of weeks ago. I am so pleased with the results! I use it before bed by itself. In the morning my skin is so clear, smooth and the softest it's been since my 20's. I am 53 years old..."
By the way I have been using the hydro boost eye gel for a couple of years and I love it! Thank you Neutogena xoxo
"This has gave my skin such a hydration boost without making me break out. I was skeptical trying out this new line, but I'm so glad I did. You don't need a lot of product because a little goes a long way. It absorbs really well into the skin without giving you the dewy sweaty look. I have oily skin, but overusing cleansers and toners, I needed something that was going to help my skin without adding more oil to it."
"Hydro boost multivitamin booster does exactly what it promises. At almost 40, my skin was looking dull and tired. After only 2 weeks I started seeing results and my skin just kept on improving from there! My skin tone is more even and much brighter."
I love the feel of this lightweight product. Doesn't feel heavy under makeup. MAKES MY SKIN FEEL GREAT.
"I have sensitive skin, and I was worried when I first bought the hydroboost line since a lot of products give me a rash, I was so happy this didn't and my skin is very hydrated and mostly clear."
"I used this product for 30 days and saw no change in my skin's texture or moisture levels. I also wish Neutrogena would stop using words such as ""instantly"" and ""see results in 7 days."" Those types of descriptions are misleading and unfair to the consumer. As in my case, neither of those happened. Am growing weary of Neutrogena products not living up to their expectations and will be switching to more natural products."
My skin felt good the first week using the booster and moisturizer..after that ..DISASTER! It literally bleached out my skin in spots. No more Neutrogena products for me ever again. It also felt sticky. I will go back to my PONDS moisturizer and will feel much better to get my real skin back. Wrinkles are slight but so what..it's me.
"I love this vitamin booster! I use the entire line of Hydro Boost and this is definitely an integral part of the line. I use this first after I cleanse my face. My face looks so much better, definitely more moisture than when I used different products"
and also clearer skin. This is a line I will use for a long time.
"We all know that Vitamins are a healthy part of skincare and cell turnover. I wash, pat dry, and apply this serum before HydroBoost gel-cream! I've been using these products for 2 months and I absolutely love the way my skin looks and feels! #holygrail"
"This is the first serum that I absolutely love! I have combination/sensitive skin and most serums tend to make me break out. Not this one! Loaded with vitamins, this serum transforms my stressed/tired skin into radiant skin! My face is so soft and I'll never be without!"
"I bought this a few weeks ago (since I had finished a previous old moisturizering booster that made me breakout.) Gave it a try applied it during the day & night time & it has not once made me breakout & I have oily combination skin! My skin is clear, hydrated, & plump! Just now finished my first bottle & on to buying my second one! ♥️"
"I bought this product three days ago. At first I wasnt sure if I would like it or not, as it has a little bit of a weird sheilded feeling while it's drying. I continued to use it before bed and when I woke up. I woke up this morning and my face has never been so soft. I love it. I'm excited to see more improvement on my face!"
"I have very dry skin and had recently broken out. My skin was the worst it was in years. I had to really step up my skin care routine, and this is one of the products I swear by. I noticed a difference the first time I used it! My skin feels much more moisturized, is way clearer & has no longer looks dull. You can't do better than this product, especially with its low price point."
I am so happy with my products they are great. I am loving it
I love this product I love the whole line of neutrogena. I have been using this product for months and I'm in love
So happy with this product !!!! IT's really works and I recomend the product for perfect hydratation.
Really like the Hyrdroboost range but disappointed to find my face covered in glitter/sparkles after using this serum. Not really necessary in skin care.
I lice this product its like vitamins for your face all in one!!! It makes my dace feel younger and brighter and more supple..i would buy this over n over n over!!
I like the hydro boost products. And this one has a tiny amount of shimmer. Which i love tbh. But it may not be for everyone... Smells just like their overnight gel mask. ( I wish this came in a bigger size.) Also epic.
Love this product. Just love the way my face feels after applying it. It feels like it has been given a boost and feels refreshing. I use it every morning and night and have already repurchased since I am running low on my first bottle.
Hydro Boost serum is great! The scent is light and it definitely works. My face felt moisturized and never sticky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Multivitamin Booster. It didn't irritate my skin at all and I have sensitive skin. My skin feels rejuvenated every morning! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just started using this product this week but already like how my skin looks and feels.
"This Neutrogena Hydroboost vitamin boost serum is phenomenal! Leaves skin so soft, nourished, hydrated, and glowing. You feel healthier just putting some on. We owe it to our face to use this. I will definitely be buying more of this amazing product and"
I absolutely recommend it! #LoveNeutrogenaHydroBoost
"I thought it was a big help for my very dry and dull winter skin. I usually have dry, flakey patches over most of my face in the winter. This product corrected the dryness I already had and prevented a reoccurrence. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the texture and the smell, it makes my face feel comfortable immediately after applying it, it absorbs fast without a greasy sensation. The effect last all day and I can use my regular moisturizer after, then my make up and my face feels and looks nice all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the whole line of Neutrogena hydro boost products. This one works great and is totally affordable. I will be repurchasing again.
It worked or me very well. It helped to clear up the dry patches I had on my forehead and cheeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Remove the glitter or whatever it is. I realize itâs supposed to refr light but it makes me look like a drag queen.
I had high hopes for this however I discovered as I applied this to my face that it contains glitter. I can't feel that my face is clean with all this glitter everywhere.
"I like it , it seem to give my skin a little bit of healthy boost and make it more healthier and softer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Its serum that disoves fast. Lightweight moisture that has multivitamins in it. My skin is soft and glowing with moisture after I use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really wanted this product to help me but it caused my skin to feel as if it was on fire/tingling with red splotches. I've tried it 3 times and every time my face hurts and becomes itchy. It looks like I have a sunburn and my face is peeling. Not happy with this product.
"I received a free trial of Neutrogena Hydro Boost multivitamin booster to try from the Home Tester Club. I have been using it nightly for over a week and think it is helping my skin. It is not drying or harsh, but I do also use a moisturizer. My skin seems to be smoother and softer to the touch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved this Neutrogena hydro boost multivitamin booster so much that I almost finished the sample bottle and purchased another bottle. I used it after facewash in the morning and at night. My skin is dry and dull but this definitely lifted the dullness and hydrated my skin. It has no odd or any fragrance. My face looks brighter and healthier .. I think I will stick to this product for long long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I stopped using any other products on my face while testing this product. I applied it at night for a week. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Multivitamin Booster went on smooth and dried quickly, instantly giving me the appearance of hydrated skin, without being greasy or leaving any residue. But each morning, my skin was incredibly flaky and dry. At least it's unscented and didn't seem to irritate my skin. I did break out in a spot I don't usually get pimples, though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a really nice serum. I do like using it along with another moisturizer and I will continue using it. For me though I dont know if ill purchase it on ny own. Not a bad product though. Provides extra moisture. The beads and pump container are visually pleasing. I don't find this product to be much different than the regular hydroboost moisturizers so for me I don't see a point in purchasing this and adding it to my routine permanently. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I didn't know if this product would be good for me when I first looked at it. I tried it and it balanced my combination skin out great. I wash my face then use this after my moisturizer and it works great. sometime without the moisturizer it's still great my face doesn't get dry or oily all day long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved using this product! It was so gentle on my skin and seemed to improve its appearance instantly! It was like a big drink of water for my face and in this cold weather we've been having, I really needed it. My skin felt better and seemed to take makeup application over it better than it usually does. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the NEUTROGENA HYDRO BOOST MULTIVITAMIN BOOSTER from Home Tester Club totally for free and I tried it for several days. It just improved my skin quality, and my skin now glows. I am so glad that I got the opportunity to test this facial serum for free. I just love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Not only does the bottle and product look cool, and scream use me! But its really is a fantastic find. It leaves your skin moisturized, and completely hydrated. And gives an amazing glow, just adding to your already beautiful face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I bought this because it is so far the only Hydro Boost moisturizer that does not contain gross silicones. After smearing it all over my face, it dried sticky....and covered in tiny sparkles! Sparkles in skincare intended for ladies over the age of 12.....no thanks."
"I stopped using any other products on my face while testing this product. I applied it at night for a week.

"Hydro boost multivitamin booster is just what i expected. It's kinda sticky , but wouldn't stick to your hand. You gently have to apply on your face after cleansing, or mix it with your moisturizer. The fact is , I have been using it for a week and ppl are saying , am glowing."
