"I saw a lot of reviews saying this cream burned people's skin. I'm SO surprised by that because it is so light weight and soothing on my skin and I don't feel a thing when I put it on. Sorry for everyone that happened too, but my experience has been great!"
"I absolutely love this cream!! I went away from it for a while and tried other things I received in my Fab Fit Fun box, but I came back to this cream. For the record, yes, it can make your face feel a little warm at first, but it goes away after a few seconds and you are left with skin that is super soft and healthy!!! Can't recommend this enough!!!"
I can definitely see an improvement in my neck. It's seems softer and younger looking. I love the way it absorbs into my face but I feel a tingling burning for a little while after applying and it's appears to dry out my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought this a while ago and I can say that I wasn't all that impressed with it. I don't have anything bad to say, really, except that it didn't seem very intense and it didn't feel like there was anything sinking into my skin (felt greasy, honestly). I wouldn't dissuade anyone from buying this but I would recommend trying the overnight hydrating face cream first."
"It burns especially around my nose, however it doesn't cause redness and when I wake up my skin feels so soft. I've never had something burn on my skin and I've used many other aveeno products before."
"I bought this cream today thinking that it is going to be a good addition to my skin products. This is not a first Aveeno product I use. I am very happy with Aveeno positively radiant daily moisturizer spf30 but this cream is really bad. Right after I applied it on my face and neck, I started feeling tingling sensation and after that burning on my chin, cheeks, forehead and neck. My faces got red to the point that I had to wash off the cream. Even though my face was washed the burning continued."
"Bought this last weekend and have really been trying to give it a shot but I can't use this anymore. It burns. My skin is warm, red, itchy and blotchy with rash. It feels like a bad wind burn almost. I've used other Aveeno products and have been happy. I was looking for a good replacement for my previous Lush lotion because of the price. I had high hopes because it smells awesome, but this has been a poor and disappointing experience."
"I bought this cream thinking it would be a great product as I have used Aveeno for many years and love the products, but I applied it one evening and it burned! The next morning I woke up with a splotchy rash all over my face. There must be something wrong with the formula as many people have commented that it burns. I love Aveeno, but this product should be taken off the shelf. I wish I never purchased."
"I have been using this cream for a few years and have loved it even more than expensive department store creams. But the last one I purchased seems like a different formulation, it is clogging my pores and it stings when I apply it. I hope they go back to the original, this was my favorite cream!!"
I just bought this product. Used it two nights. I have severe itching and rash. Didn't sleep last two nights . So disappointing..I have been using the daily moisturizer and brightening cleanser for years and love them. I do not have sensitive skin or usually have reactions.
"I highly recommend this night cream. It contains soy, which gives your skin a nice brightening effect. I find it is comparable to the high-end department store brightening creams for less cost. Plus it does not irritate my sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is the best I wake up with my face feeling smooth and not dried out. Would recommend this to everyone
I applied this and it caused me to feel significant discomfort and burning sensation. The smell is over powering. I don't I understand why this product has not been taken off the shelf with all the obviously issues other customers are experiencing.
This product has great features for people with sensitive skin its absorbing effects are great and don't irritate skin . I love how it calms your skin with irritating your skin it makes your skin feel soft hydrated and clean [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am an Aveeno Positively Radiant fan, that is why I bought the night cream. I use the daily moisturizer and face wash and love them. However, everytime I use this cream, my face burns like heck for a while after applying. I'm not sure why this keeps happening, but scrolling through other reviews, I see that it isn't just me. I do not have sensitive skin. It's very disappointing..i really wanted to love it."
"I typically use Aveeno Intensive Night Cream, but decided to try the Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream . After applying I did initially feel a slight burning sensation, but it left quickly, so I didn't wash off. The next day I experienced red, blotchy under eye area and rash around my mouth and chin, like a sunburn. I will not be using again."
"I bought this product today , I just applied it right now but my face was burning very bad I had to wash my face instantly. I'm very disappointed, I'm starting to get red spots on my face. What can I do ?"
"I only applied a small amount of this cream & within minutes my face felt like it was on fire. I had to immediately wash my face & apply hydrocortisone cream to calm my face. I tried this product a few more times, same results. Had to return this. Not recommended for sensitive facial skin!! Also, too highly fragranced which doesn't help either. Extremely disappointed."
"Creams are always too heavy or too light for my skin. Gel moisturizers feel fresh, but it feels it does not absorve properly. The thick creams are too heavy. This cream has a ""mousse"" texture that gives the perfect balance. It absorves fast and leaves the skin with a velvety texture. Too soon to describe the effects for everything it promises, but I am already happy with this. It will be my main cream from now on. You beated Lancome!"
"I have had spider veins on my chest and neck for years due to early menopause. It always embarrassed me. I have just finished my first jar and noticed WOW!! I can hardly see the spider veins. I have used many a product and nothing has worked. Even though this cream DOES NOT CLAIM to reduce spider veins, I am hear to tell you IT DOES!!. This is my lifetime night cream now. Not greasy and my face is smooth and feels great. I have already recommended this product to all my friends."
"A good friend of mine, who is a new daddy, told me about the night cream. I'm a guy and I'm a bit skeptical about night creams. But, after using the night cream for 2 weeks, I saw positive changes to my facial skin. Smoother, full skin. Haven't gotten eye circles. Light blemishes have diminished; I have more of an even tone. I, now, use Aveeno's Broad Spectrum 30 and Daily Scrub to keep from getting blemishes from the sun. It works."
"I have been using this product since February and short of Aveeno not making it anymore (which is a scary thought for me), I do not see myself going without it. I use it every night and the difference in dryness, tone and fine lines is remarkable. It's also evened out the color of the sides of my face which for whatever reason was darkening. I went from using Clinique products to Aveeno and there's no going back. Highly recommended."
"I gave this product higher scores for effectiveness, because it is moisturizing, but lower for satisfaction. The product burns on application, as a few other commenters have mentioned. Since the ingredient list is on the box rather than the tub I can't say what the culprit may be, but it's unusual for an Aveeno product. Not sure at this point if I will continue using it. I checked ""yes"" to recommend to a friend only because ""maybe"" wasn't offered. I would recommend it to a friend with no history of sensitive skin."
"I have used this product a few times and notice a burning sensation for the first few minutes as it sinks into my skin. My face/skin feels tight after that. It has a nice texture and light weight product. I am concerned that there is no ingredients list on the box, jar, or on this website. I'm allergic to camomile but don't know if that is what my skin is reacting to"
"This cream contains tocopheryl acetate, which is a synthetic vitamin E. I am allergic to this synthetic vitamin, so now my face has broken out in itchy hives. I haven't had this issue before with other Aveeno products, so it was very frustrating. It would be nice to have a brand that offered a wide variety of products that I could count on to not have this ingredient, apparently Aveeno is not that brand."
"I applied this cream for the first time and after a day, i noticed that my face is covered with tiny non-itchy bumps. I can feel that my skin is rough and dry.it's been almost 2 days and the bumps still haven't gone away. I have been using aveeno for facial cleanser, scrub and day moisturizer for years now. I thought i never had this problem with the product but the night cream caused problem on my face."
"i love the way my skin feels in the morning but i don't like the burning feeling i have when first put it on. It eventually goes away but i don't think a night cream should burn. The fragrance is also pretty strong. Sadly, i wouldn't recommend this cream"
"I have been looking for a product to replace the Ultra-Calming Moisturizing Cream. I would put it on under the Ultra-Calming Daily Moisturizer as added protection and hydration because there was no ""extras"" like sunscreen, vitamins, fragrance etc. I am disappointed that the night cream is no longer offered. The Ultra-calming products are a life saver."
"I started using this product about a month ago, never used a night cream before, but now I am totally in love with this one. It goes on great, just a little tingling in the beginning but then it stopped. I also use it during the day which I find very effective underneath my makeup. I seem to have my makeup not creased due to the hot weather. And stays on all day. This product helps with black spots, I notice a reduction in the spots on my face. Great product. Aveeno please let this one stay forever in your line."
"I have been using this night cream for about a week. For the past two nights it burns when I put it on and I break out in a red rash. I did some research on the ingredients and I believe its the vit b3 that is causing this reaction. I also noticed the pores in my t zone are more visible and this is a problem I have never had before. I am really bummed, I will have to continue my search for the perfect night cream."
"I have used aveeno for years with no problem. So when I decided to to add a night cream I went strait to the Aveeno section. I applied this once with in seconds my face was on fire. I washed it right off but it left my face bright red and bleeding, my face felt rough and itchy for a week. I would not recommend this to anyone."
I love aveeno products and use many of them - I ran out of my usual night moisturizer (positively ageless) and was having trouble finding it in stores so I ordered it online and decided to try this one while I waited. Terrible mistake! It stung when I applied it and my neck beoke out in a terrible itchy rash. My face feels bumpy and is slightly red too. I am throwing the rest out and never using this again. Aveeno dropped the ball with this one.
"I use both the positively radiant night cream and the moisturizer SPF 30 and it itches for a few minutes. I tried putting cetaphil cream (which doesn't itch) first, then I use the Aveeno cream and the itch reduces. There must be an ingredient that irritates my skin. However, the dark spots are slowly fading. I would love to continue using this product but I don't know how long I can deal with the itchiness."
I love the product! But for the first 5 or 10 minutes there is a burning/tingling effect on my face and everyone else's I've had try it just to make sure it was not just me. I don't mind it to much. To me it makes it feel like it is really working. But there was no warning on the product to suggest that this was even a possibility . I do see noticeable change in the softness and brightness of my face.
I have been using this product for about a week and I love it! I have oily skin and it does not leave my skin oily at all and it does not break me out. It leaves my skin soft and radiant. I have actually noticed a reduction of oil since using this product. I highly recommend.
"I only used this product for two days, and by the first day I noticed that my acne was flaring up, but I still persisted for one more day, and when I woke up the next morning, my skin was a COMPLETE MESS, my T-zone was extremely greasy, I had whiteheads all over my face, and my acne became the worst I've ever had. It did not even deliver with the '5 factors of radiance'. DO NOT USE if you have combination skin, sensitive skin, or acne-prone (even if it's hormonal acne)."
"I bought this product because I fell in love with the Positively Radiant CC Cream, but wanted something for night. When I put it on this evening, it immediately started to burn to the point that I had to wash it off. I thought that it might be because I have sensitive skin, but wanted to see if anyone else had the same problem. I have found multiple reviews on various websites about the same thing. I'm so disappointed because I love the CC Cream and have told several friends and family members how great it is."
I've never had an acne problem until I started using this product. I've used for about 2 weeks and it makes my skin feel oily and I wake up in the morning with pimples. It did moisturize my face but now I have acne marks instead of an even skin tone.
"I have always had super clear skin up until last year when my face started to constantly breakout. I kept resorting to Dove products which I had always used but my skin never got better. After using Aveeno's positively radiant and clear complexion products, my skin started to clear in just 3 days. I have been using these products daily for 6 months and absolutely love them! I have very sensitive skin and these products haven't caused any irritation. I recommend both products."
"I have used this line (Positively Radiant) without difficulty in the past. l was looking for a cream without sunscreen to use at night. Unfortunately, it stings my face when put it on. l am still able to use the cleanser and daily moisturizer with SPF 15. I will try to return the product and hope l can find something else. It doesn't work for me."
"This is not for newbies. I have found that this takes off skin tags. Give it a few weeks. Amazing. My husband used it, after much pleading from me, and he saw the difference in one night. We are 60plus and this is great stuff. I use it for sagging skin under the arms, too. LOVE this."
"I must start by saying that I have dry skin, but it is neither sensitive, nor have I ever suffered from eczema, pimples, redness, etc. I don't know what Aveeno was thinking with this new positively radiant line. It stung on my face the minute I applied it. Not the soothing feeling I was seeking. My skin was all red the next morning. The scent is also very unpleasant. I am not against scents, but this one did not agree with me. I bought Aveeno looking for a natural, soothing product. This is not it."
"This moisturizer was terrible, it made me break out and made my skin feel a very strong burning sensation! I tried to continue using it but my face, specially the chin and neck area were very red and itchy! I used it for two weeks and it never got better, my face continued to sting for as long as I wore it."
"I too have used Aveeno products for many years; face wash and daily moisturizing cream. I am getting older the wrinkles around my eyes have become more prominent in the last few years so I figured I would stick to the tried and true brand and get the night cream. Well, this was not the right product for me. It made my eye lids and under my eye turn bright red ( for three days now) and it burns when touched. No more night cream for me!"
"Love this night cream. I have seen positive results within just a few nights of use. Love the scent and the smoothness of the cream. It does not make my face dry or oily, just perfect everytime. A little goes a long way, so the price is quite reasonable. Keep this product please!!"
i only used this night cream for week. I have combination skin type and this was making me break out. The only thing that i liked about the cream is that it smells good but it didnt not work for me. After applying it it left my face feeling really greasy. I would not recommend this to someone that has acne prone skin.
"I purchased this product because I needed a nightime cream that did not have a SPF. The first time I used this product I developed some areas of redness on my face. I also instantly started to feel a tingling sensation afterwards. I decided to wash my face a second time hoping the tingling sensation would go away. However, the tingling sensation continued. I plan to return the product tomorrow."
"I have been using this cream for almost 3 weeks. My skin (which is normally oily and dry at the same time!) feels and looks so much better...especially in direct sunlight! I wash at night with a face wipe and apply, I cannot wait to get it on each night! I did not have any breakouts as a result from using this cream, and I would say I have had fewer since. This product makes me wonder what my skin would look like if I used more Aveeno products!"
"I don't consider myself to have sensitive skin, but when I first tried this it stung. When I woke up in the morning my face was red and burning! The redness has lasted all day and has made my skin very irritated. I have never reacted this way before and am truly surprised this happened with Aveeno, which I thought had gentler formulas. I just want to know what ingredient is the culprit so I can avoid it in the future."
"This lotion made my face burn. I thought it would pass so I left it on while I slept. I woke up to my cheeks beat red and pimples on my nose and cheeks. This is the second time I bought the lotion. The first time I used it it wasn't that bad. My skin did feel softer, but it never turned my face so red. It actually feels and looks burnt. I see a lot of people have experience the burning. Perhaps you should rethink the production of this product. It's been 2 days and my face is still red....not good!"
"I have used other Aveeno products for years with no problem. Recently, looking for a less expensive night cream, I decided to give this product a try. I started to itch and scratch that night. I did not connect this the cream and used it again. The next day the itch continued along with red puffiness along my cheek bones. I am unable to use this product."
"I wish I read the reviews before purchasing and using Aveeno night cream yesterday. I love Aveeno facial scrub and daily moisturizer but the night cream left me with red and itchy skin after one use. My face still feels flushed today, I will not put it on my face again."
"I really like any other Aveeno product, but this one is awful !!!"
"The second day I started using it I was noticing a change with my skin not understanding what had happened... maybe something I ate ... I searched everything... well 4 nights into it I realized that my skin got very warm and itchy right away after using it, then I knew this night cream was very wrong. Something is not right is all I know !!!"
"I love this product. I use my Clarsonic Mia, first, to make sure the night cream is fully absorbed. I have brown patches on my face from a laser procedure in 2010, so this product (and the SPF in this line) is amazing for an over the counter product. I've NEVER gotten a breakout, red skin, inflammation, nothing from using these products, and I have sensitive skin. LOVE!!"
This is my first time using a night cream and holy does it burn. I had tears in my eyes after a few minutes of this product being applied. This also happens with the Aveeno Daily Moisturizer and cream as well. I've stopped using both products as who wants their face to burn off?
"I am experiencing the same issue others posted. I have used the daily cream in this line and LOVE it! Therefore, I thought the night cream would be a similar product. Completely, wrong. I am experiencing itching just like others have described. There are too many complaints on this product."
"ADMIN: I know I can call you. I tried, but the department is closed. This product needs to be evaluated."
"This product is amazing! I also have very sensitive skin, so sensitive that I have to use a certain kind of shampoo and body wash. However, this product did not cause me any problems. I used it directly following the scrub pads and woke up to clearer skin! I love it! The price was worth my results. I will continue to use this product as long as it remains in my price range."
"I have normal/combination, sensitive, and acne-prone skin. I have a few post-acne marks, age spots, and some redness around my nose/cheeks. I've been pairing this with the Positively Radiant SPF 30 and I've noticed that my skin looks healthier than it has in a long time. My skin has a healthy glow and a more even tone than it used to. I'll continue to use this product and so far it hasn't caused break outs and doesn't sting when applied. I'd recommend this to a friend or family member."
"It's a thick cream but that's why it's better for night and really cold weather. It actually absorbs pretty quickly and makes my skin look really soft. I really love my radiant day cream too, It's the only one I use. I was inspired to write this because the reviews are so bad. That really surprises me. I've had nothing but good experiences."
"Within a minute of applying the cream, I experienced a burning sensation and my face turned red. The first time I tried it (about 2 weeks ago), the burning feeling came and I thought maybe my skin was dry that day or extra sensitive. I tried it ago today, and it did the same thing. Something's wrong with this night cream."
"I was excited to use this cream, since I love other Aveeno products. I used it for the first time and went to bed. I woke up and thought I had pink eye, my left eye was puffed shut. Got to the bathroom mirror and realized it's both eyes. Took a sip of water and realized I've got a fat lip, too. Come to this website and see DOZENS of reviews about people experiencing puffiness, redness, itching, flaking, and other bad reactions. Why is this product still being sold?"
"I bought this cream last night , and started using it today , after I apply the cream on my face, my face started to feel like it was burning and I got a rash all"
"Over my face . I had to washed it right away because the burning feeling wouldn't go away. I'm have been using the aveeno products for years , and this is the first time that something like this happened. I will absolutely not use this cream again."
"I read the reviews after buying and i almost returned it, but after reading one or two positives decided to give it a try. It's only been a few nights and my i can see my face getting better , no burning and i love that when i wake up my face is soft and no greasy, i don't have sensitive skin, maybe that's what's been happening to other people."
This causes break outs it does help a little with red blotches on skin but not that much. This did more damage than good because it broke me out all over my face. I never had this many pimples on my face at once d or in my life and it broke me out everywhere. Not sure what in this cream is causing that. I'm reading alot of similar reviews.
"I've been using this product for a few nights now, and while I understand the comments regarding burning and tingling, I haven't had any issues if I allow 30 minutes or so to elapse before I actually go to bed. Not sure if my skin just isn't as sensitive as others, but using this in combination with the 30spf day cream, and 60 second facial, has been fantastic."
"I bought this and have only used a few times (I am a die hard aveeno fan...I use the body wash, lotion, baby wash, baby shampoo, EVERYTHING for my family's sensitive skin.) this is the first time I've ever had a negative experience. This stuff burns my face almost instantly! I use it with aveeno face wash. Couldn't believe all of the similar reviews. Something is crazy wrong with this night cream!"
I bought this last month and I got a red rash on my face. I put it on and woke up with a red face and little bumps all over. My face also feels super chapped!!! I am very disappointed because I always speak so highly of aveeno products. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS AT ALL.
This is a great face product that I highly recommend. Walmart has the best price.
Smells very floral and makes my eyes water. Says its hypoallergenic. Terrible and I smell like my grandma!
I bought this thinking I was grabbing something new and great to spruce up my skin care. It burned my entire face. I had to wash it off almost immediately.
"Like other reviewers have said, my face also got a red, itchy rash after using Aveeno's Positively Radiant Night Cream. I'm so disappointed. I guess I'll just stick with their hand lotion."
I bought this a month ago and I hate it. Makes me feel like my skin is on FIRE!!!! SUPER ITCHY RASH and makes me all red. Will never repurchase.
i brought this about a week ago and in my opinion it is working big improvement of laugh lines and spots
"The burning is seriously not that bad. It burned the first time and I woke up with flawless skin. It still burns just a tad around my nose but I swear, I have had so many complement my skin and it is from this cream."
I have developed very sensitive skin over the last 2 years. Unfortunately I could not continue using it. It burns my face and in the morning I had little pimples all over my face.
i typically love aveeno products but every time i use this it makes my face burn like crazy and causes my skin to get red and splotchy. also have some dryness and breakouts.
"I've been using positively radiant for some time now. I think I'm 1/2 way through my 2nd jar. I had a rather large ""age spot"" and it is hardly noticeable now. I'm very happy with this product."
Adoro estos productos... son buenisimos..desde la primera vez que lo use me encanto .tengo los piros abiertos y con estos productos cuando los uso se notan mas cerrados y me dejan la piel suave..
"I've have been using for a few days now. Not long enough to give a great review, but, my face does burn when i use it. I am not sure why, sensitivity, allergies?"
"After using this product for two days I developed a horrible, itch rash. It last for 4 weeks, and cause my face to swell up. If you have sensitive skin, do not use."
"You gave me another reason to love you even more than I already do, Aveeno. This is amazing. I don't ever write reviews, but this product is well deserving of one. It can be a bit pricy, but its worth every penny and a little goes a long way!!"
I tried this product mainly because of the Jennifer Aniston ads. I've used it now for a week and it definitely has given me a more even tone to my face. Love love love this stuff. Keep it coming Jennifer!! :-)
"I like how my skin feels when I put it on, but there is quite a bit of stinging at the beginning. Not sure why, unless there is perfume in it. I use the Aveeno Smart Essentials Daily Nourishing Moisturizer during the day which does not sting."
"I was looking for a natural moisturizer without sun screen. At first I liked this moisturizer, but then I noticed my cheeks and forehead we're drying out. So now I guess I am gonna have to look for a new product"
I have very sensitive skin and began using the Aveeno Ultra-Calming cleansing pads then followed up with this night cream ... Terrific duo .. It healed places where I had broken the skin on my face from a fall .. Wow I am very impressed !!
I hate to say that Aveeno disappointed me .I have loved Aveeno products all the time and i decided to try night cream but I got very bad allergic reaction all over my face i freaked out. Please research before you buy.
I tried this for first time last night and it made my face burn. I thought maybe it was because it was brand new and my skin was not used to it. So tonight I tried it again and it is burning even more than last night. Also it seems very fragrant.
"i have been using the Positively Radiant Line for over 3 years and I love it the facial scrub , night cream and cleanser. I have always had pretty clear skin but when using this product line on my skin it looks and feels amazing."
I bought this product a few days ago. I applied it before I went to bed. I woke up early to my face bright red and it felt like it was on fire. my eyes were swollen. I will not use this product.
"Please use caution if you have sensitive skin. This product burned my skin. I'm so devastated. I love aveeno products so I never imagined I would have such a bad reaction. My skin is red, itchy, and burning like crazy. Will return."
I recently purchased this product because I was almost out of the last one. The formula has changed plus it has more additives than the original one. Avenno !! PLEASE bring back the original Positively Radiant Overnight Hydrating Facial
This is one of the best night cream. I don't like heavy creams that feel like they're clogging your pours. Lightweight and fresh smelling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have had this product for about a month and I have to say honestly there has been a very minimal change in my skin. I wasn't expecting to use it at night and then wake up and just be completely fall asleep but I just expected a little more.
"The first night I used it I felt the irritation but figured since it was a new my skin need to adjust. I was wrong! After a week of using it every night I noticed my face was breaking out. The last night I used it, the burning hurt so much I had to quickly wash my face with cold water. After two weeks of not using it my face cleared up. I wish I had visited this website to see the reviews before purchasing it"
This cream makes my skin very red and burn a lot. I want a refund. I've used aveeno 15spf moisturizer for over 4 years now and love it but for some reason this vitamin e night cream burns for 30 minutes after application and makes my skin red all the time. What is going on?
I just want to start by saying this cream did burn the first few times I applied which was right after a hot shower when the pores of my face were opened. So I now wait a few minutes after showering before applying it and it took care of the problem. I use it every night and I LOVE how smooth my skin feels in the morning.
"I like the way it smells, i feel refreshed and relax."
I use the Aveeno daily scrub and love it! I tried this new night cream and absolutely love it!
"I have never had burning or itching or bumps as the other's reviewed? I have smooth, silky"
pleasant smelling skin after I use this night cream! I would like to know where I can buy a larger size.
"Within three times of using it I had little red bumps all over my face. I am very disappointed with this product. I have super sensitive skin and have always done well with Aveeno products, hopefully this review will help others with the same type of skin."
"Our family has used Aveeno products for years with confidence. As a physician, I also recommend Aveeno regularly to my patients. This product was purchased by my teenage daughter who has beautiful skin. This cream caused redness, irritation, and stinging. She described feeling as if her face was on fire. I discourage others from purchasing this product and hope that Aveeno will modify the formula significantly or remove it from their collection."
Not as moisturizing as I anticipated and also such a small container for the price
"I really did want to like this product, but unfortunately this burns my skin! I'm worried to continue using this."
I have been using this on top of my Rosehip serum at night time. My skin is so soft and luminous in the morning and it doesn't cause me to break out!
"It works for my skin , I've tried many other kinds of lotions , face product , etc. And aveeno is what works the best for me ."
This product has improved my skin so much! I use it every night! It made my skin look healthier and with a natural glow. I love it!
I can't get passed the smell of this product. It is very light weight but I think I would a fragrance free version of this product.
After 5 days of using this product I am peeling. I have naturally oily skin. Is this suppose to be happening?
My mom had some brown patches below her eyes and she uses this daily. She loves it and it is very reasonably priced.
I really wanted to love this facial cream I've already been using the facial wash and the day cream that go with it but when I used night cream the second night I have a burning sensation and woke up with a rash
pls do not buy as it does not work as promised...I always use olay but then just shifted to try Aveeno. I have been using it since couple of months ...absolutely there z no change ....
I bought this product a few days ago as I read about it on allure magazine. I do not have sensitive skin whatsoever and have tried just about every product out there. This has ruined my skin! My cheeks are incredibly spotchy with bumps that will not go away. I've been on accutane so I don't breakout and I just came out of a facial five days ago and my skin has never been worse! Such a shame cause I usually love their products and I even bought two at once cause I had high hopes. Now I have to throw it all away!
I have tried expensive creams but this is my favorite! It's oil free and doesn't cause breakouts. It's gentle on my sensitive skin. I love that it has vitamins and antioxidants. I use it in the morning under my makeup as well as at night. I get compliments on my skin! I hope they replace the jar packaging.
"I decided to try this night cream to add to my other two daily Aveeno routines (Aveeno clear complexion cream cleanser and the positively radiant sheer daily moisturizing face lotion with spf 30) the first time I used it I washed my face and then applied this night cream and my face immediately stung. I tried it again another night , it didn't sting but the following morning my face became splotchy with small red dots."
"I've always loved Aveeno products for my sensitive and eczema skin. I use their lotions, body washes, and have used their face washes/scrubs. I even use Aveeno baby for my babys delicate skin. However, this product burned my face within seconds and gave me red itchy rashes all over my face. I gave it another try after my rashes healed, and same thing happened. So I know its definitely this product."
"Immediately after applying this cream, my face become red and I felt an irritation. Aveno products have worked really well for me for the past several years. I have used the intensive night cream as well with no problems. This time it caused burning, redness, and irritation."
I received this as a gift and once applied it immediately burned! Never again!
after first use felt a diffrence on my skin will deffantly use again
I love it corrects and moisturizes does what it says it will do in a short time.
burns right after being applied and breaks out on cheeks and nose. itchy skin where skin breaks out
I bought this just today. As soon as I put it on my face started getting red and burning. I removed it with a makeup remover but my skin is burning and red now. Would never recommend.
"I have used Aveeno products for years with no issues. Decided to try the night cream. First couple of days were okay, but on day 3, I had itchy red bumps all over my face and neck. Didn't make the connection until day 4 (today), so I have now stopped using it. Hopefully it will clear up quickly!"
Does what it says it will
My skin feels so soft and hydrated ignores feels like brand new skin I love it
"Woke up with my face red, burning, and full of bumps (not acne)! My face felt itchy all day and as the day went by it started to burn and look puffy."
"i just bought this couple days ago. It burns my face so bad, especially the center of my face. Does the alcohol content burn the face this bad?"
"This product started off OK, but after a week my face started to sting after use. I'm quite surprised about this reaction from an Aveeno product. Quite disappointed."
I put this on after a hot shower and my skin burned a bit. After about 30 min it had gotten worse and my skin was red. I washed it off and after a few hours my skin recovered.
"Been using basic aveeno since it came to UK. recommend it to everyone. Only thing I use. My son bought me this night cream...my nightmare. Reading the reviews I know it's the start of a week of looking like a monster. Red sore and puffy, wish I had seen this site first. Did a hand test instead , no reaction."

"this is a great moisturizer, it seems to help with the tiny lines around my eyes. have already recommended it"
