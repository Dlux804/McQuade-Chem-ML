I have been using L'Or√©al for approx. two weeks and I can see the BAGS under my eyes slowly disappearing along with the skin on my forehead and neck tightening. FANTASTIC results!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I felt and saw a visual difference. I think it might be less expensive and could feel and see a difference. If something is just OK I would never give 5 stars.
"Several months ago, I stumbled upon this moisturizer and love it. I've tried all types of products over the years for my dry skin, but this is the best. Most men wait too late to begin using a product like this, but the sooner you start, the longer your skin will look better. I've tried the one with and with the sun protection and love them both. It makes my skins feel good and look better."
IT is a good productos but you cant find IT at the store anymore . Only online
Non-greasy product. Love the way it feels and gives smooth results.
Once I bought it I will never change productsit help the over all look an feel of my skin
I bought this product 3 weeks ago. After I started using it I notice that the cream is not adsorbed in the skin and I got some white flacks on the face.
I hope you really like headache inducing fragrance if you purchase this because that seems to be the main ingredient. I had to wash my face again after thirty minutes because i kept waiting for the scent to dissipate but it never did.
"It make me headache cause that smell,too strong"
"As a day in, day out product, this cream delivers consistent results. The only down side is the creamy smell that lingers for a bit, but it wears out as the morning rolls along."
I enjoy this product!
