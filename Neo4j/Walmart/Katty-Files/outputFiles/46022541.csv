I first started using this sunscreen when I received a sample from my dermatologist. I have dry skin and it keeps my face hydrated. It works great as a base for my foundation. I highly recommend this product. I'm 68 years old and never leave the house without first applying sunscreen.
Best face sunscreen. Recommended and sold at my dermatologist office. Great coverage and you won't burn. It doesn't run into your eyes and sting. Goes on white but very quickly disappears with minimal rubbing. I've recommended to and they've all purchased and loved it.
"Smooth, creamy and great protection."
