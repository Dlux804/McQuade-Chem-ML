"I'm in love with CeraVe products and this is no exception. It absorbs quickly (unless you put too much on). It takes less than you would think to do what it is supposed to do. The one draw back was that it must have taken 30 or 40 ""pumps"" before the first bit of product came out. After that, one pump is allyou need, or maybe even a little less than a full pump."
i have been using this serum for about six months now and i seen some reduction in fine lines . i use it about 3 times a week since my skin is very sensitive .
"i needed the SA and i know that Cerave is what many people consider the best non prescrition products. i use it because i have Rosacea. you wo uld never know. i have one or two little bumps from the roseacea and i read that SA is a good thing to treat them with. i'm using it in the AM and PM. it really gets my skin usper clean feeling. and soft. waiting to see if the bumps subside and even if they didn't this is a great cleanser for sensitive skin. doesn't strip the natural oils, and leave it silky smooth. very good purchase!"
"I applied this twice a day around my eyes for just over 7 weeks. Also used CeraVe skin renewing night cream nightly. Top photo is before, bottom is after. No side effects, pleasant smell and texture."
"I applied this cream twice a day only around my eyes for just over 7 weeks along with cerave skin renewing night cream all over my face at night. Feels nice, no unpleasant smell. Top photo is before, bottom is after."
I love this product. But the tube is very difficult to dispense the product. Hard to squeeze and today the bottom of the tube dispensed the serum all over my top.
"I don't know how to properly dispense this product. When I squeeze it, barely a drop comes out. I've tried to open the tube, because I noticed the product leaking out the sides, which was displeasing because then it might be tainted or oxidized?! I've tried using a needle nose tweezer, which helps but ANNOYING and still messy."
I do like the feel of the serum though.
"First I want to say, I love all Cerave products. My dermatologist recommends them as well. The serum itself is great. However, getting it out of the tube is next to impossible. Seriously. You have to squeeze SO HARD to get the tiniest bit to come out. One night I went to use it and because I was trying hard to squeeze it out, the seam of the tube opened up and squirted everywhere."
"That being said, I would definitely buy this again if it were packaged differently."
I am so sad! I bought this product after reading the reviews and now upon first use the product practically shot out of the tube! I had to clean it up and didnt want to use it on my face after it had been all over the sink and counter. Maybe I just got a defective item but for the price I paid I won't be rebuying to try it.
"I love the product. I'm just finishing the first tube and have seen a great improvement. The tube, however, sucks. The top popped off and I lost a good amount. Trying to put the tube back together caused me to lose more. I got an new empty tub-type container at my health food store and put the remaining product in it. That works and my new tube will go directly in it."
"Excellent product, been through 4 or 5 bottles now. Big improvement in my skin. Love how it absorbs completely. Very gentle and moisturizing!!"
"I realky wanted to love this product, but you have to push hard for a drop to come out and then the product started coming out of the tube seal itself. Super pricey for this snd it didnt work well at all."
Hydrates deep lines
"This serum goes on easily and sinks into the skin quickly. I have used it for over a year and am still not sure that it is helping with wrinkles. Of course, I do use other anti-aging products, so it's hard to tell. Embarrassed to say that I didn't figure out how to use the pump for several weeks. I was squeezing the tube instead of pressing the pump on the top. Maybe the directions could state how to use it a little more clearly for the clueless! LOL"
I purchased after reading the ingredients. Compares to high end pharmacy derm brands at half the price. It is non-irritating. I used at nighttime only and did not add another night cream with it. Not good for during the day for me as it caused my makeup to ball up. Can't say much about how effective it is as I have been using high end skincare for years and am using it more preventively than corrective.
My husband gets pre cancerous spots on his forehead and this is just perfect for him.
"This CeraVe cream serum has a nice feel & a hint of Retinol, which is great for aging skin. It's just strong enough to notice some improvement if used nightly, but not so strong it dries up your skin. I would recommend!"
"Great retinoid for people with sensitive/problem skin. Does not over dry or irritate my rocesea skin, I do use a moisturizer over it. Great price also"
"Great product - I even use it under my eyes, I am seeing good result gradually. When using this, try to use Cerave PM instead of the AM, because the combination of the AM and this serum will create ""ball up"" residues. - I use No-Ad sunscreen SPF15 - that works perfectly on my face."
Feels good on my face. Will continue to use this product.
"This product is good for my skin, brightness and soft smooth skin appear almost as soon as you rub it in."
"You people complaining about getting it out of the tube, IT'S A PUMP! DUH!"
"Love the high amount of niacinamide and other anti-aging ingredients. It will take awhile before I can tell if they work, but I do love the way it soaks into my skin and doesn't leave a greasy or sticky residue."
"I use & like several Cerave products, but this one is a failure. The product ""balls up"" on my face. Tried it alone, then tried a light coat of moisturizer. Same results."
I love this product it makes my skin feel really good
Love this cream serum. So pleased I ordered 2 more.
"I have very sensitized skin, but I wanted a retinol product. I was using this every other night for a long time, then finally I got up the courage to try every night and my skin feels the best it has in 5 years. calm and nice...LOVE"
"This helps my skin look more glowy and healthy and I'd definitely purchase again - you have to use more moisturizer than usual after putting this on, but my skin is really happy so it's worth it!"
I really like this product. It is light on my skin. I have started to notice a little change in my skin. For the price it is a great asset to my nightly cleansing.
"After reconstruction for skin cancer my plastic surgeon told me to use nothing but CeraVe on my face. He was so right, love this product and others in their line."
"I had a coupon & read it developed with dermatologists so I decided to give it try. What a dispoint!!! I applied this cream, it does not absorbe into my skin. I had to keep rub it. next day, I have broke-out on my face. Do do buy this product, it is flaut product!!"
"I love this liquid gold. I have very troublesome skin, and this made such a difference overnight! It is worth the price."
