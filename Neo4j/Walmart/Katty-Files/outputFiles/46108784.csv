This Retinol has a visible difference on fine lines. It left my skin looking smoother and younger without dryness. I am a fan!
made my skin feel renewed and rejuvenated. would recommend for anti-aging and those looking to hit reset on their skin
"My dermatologist recommended this product to help lessen the severity of my acne breakouts (hereditary), and it works! It's much cheaper than prescription Retin-A Micro, but still gets the job done."
Wonderful customer serviced and fantastic products. I love that I can purchase Obagi products from Walmart.com
It's stronger than ROC night cream which I had been using. It causes mild irritation to the skin which is what I was looking for to know it's working well. It arrived in just a few days.
"It's strong â€” I use it just every other night, but it does seem to reduce the appearance of fine wrinkles and keep my skin a little brighter. Good price relative to other stores I checked (Amazon)."
Excellent price. Feels good on my skin. A very soft feeling. Haven't used it long enough to see a difference.
love the product so far. My skin is not irritated yet. I am noticing a smoother look. Only need to use a small amount. I haven't used it a week and already noticing a difference.
It appears to decrease my neck bumps due to dry skin Only used it 3 times
Excellent and half price of what it is sold for at doctors office.
"Great,great and great."
"The cream is fine, recently the tubes leak or explode"
