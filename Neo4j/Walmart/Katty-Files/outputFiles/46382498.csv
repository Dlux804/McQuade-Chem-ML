"I have very porcelain sensitive skin, and I have contact dermatitis to fragrance , formaldehyde and dyes. Sunscreens really irritate my skin too. I can use very few products , because they irritate my skin and cause burning and redness. I have been using this cream for over a year, and it really calms and balances the skin. I was able to get it at the drugstore, but I have to order it online now. That is why I am reviewing the product, because I would hate for it to be discontinued. You will love this cream if you have sensitive skin."
"I bought this product after reading all the good reviews, and it does not disappoint. I use it every night and after a week i clearly noticed that my skin improved! It looks way more moisturised, is softer than before, and it does not irritate my sensitive skin at all! My skin has even cleared up a lot more. I am extremely happy with this cream :)."
"I bought this moisturizer after Liah Yoo from YouTube recommended it in one of her videos. This was a nice, fragrance-free cream; I could smell the oatmeal which reminded me of breakfast, lol. I like how the cream contained ceramides which are part of our natural skin barrier. I'd repurchase but wish this came in a tube instead of a jar."
"This cream is great and relieves the itching and dryness of my ultra-sensitive skin. Why has Walmart stopped carrying it? Has it been discontinued? I hope not,"
"I am allergic to a lot of facial moisturizers and I do very well using this moisturizer. Put it on under my makeup and my face stays moisturized, but not oily. Love it!!!"
"I have been using this night cream along with the matching foaming cleaner for a few months and have noticed improvements in my dry, sensitive skin. I have very rosy cheeks and this is so soothing and gentle to my skin! it is non greasy so I actually use this in the mornings and under my makeup as a base. I still have some rosy-ness and occasional dryness but I would still say this product has helped a ton and another plus is that the cleanser does remove most makeup!!"
"Wow. I saw this at Walmart and I had to grab it. Haven't seen it in years. This was my favorite moisturizer and after trying it again tonight, I'm in love again. I think the old one used to have fragrance, so I'm pleasantly surprised that this one is fragrance free. It soothes my irritated skin and my skin feels supple. Please keep this Aveeno."
This is the only moisturizer I've found that actually helps my dry skin and does not break my face out. I have sensitive skin and cannot use anything that has a fragrance or has harsh chemicals. It's not an oily lotion and seems to absorb into my skin quickly. It helps a lot with redness and irritation. I love this face cream.
"I'm a guy who experiences extremely dry skin due to neurological activity. I've been trying different brands for years. The only two features I look for is that it be oil-free and shine free. I tried a lot of products that were oil-free, but left an immediate shiny residue. This is the only product I found that delivered on both. Thank you Aveeno."
I had an expensive hydrafacial that left me with red and excoriated skin and exacerbated my rosacea. I went looking for a cream to calm and help my skin and so happy to find this product! I use it day and night in the winter and use the lighter moisturizer with spf in the summer. This is the only product I am comfortable using now with my sensitive skin! It is amazingly non greasy and makes my skin so soft. Thank you Aveeno!
"Love this stuff. I've tried other aveeno moisturizers, and they make my face break out and get red. This doesn't. I use the face wash and the daily moisturizer in the ultra-calming as well. It's the only thing I've tried that makes my face feel super soft without breaking out! My only complaint is that the stores stopped carrying it on their shelves, so now I have to play the Walmart store pick up game. Amazon sells it as well, but only in three packs, and this stuff isn't cheap. It's so worth the cost though."
great product and it nourishes cream. moistures and keeps smooth [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am so glad that Aveeno began making this moisturizer again. It is great for rosacea. I enjoy this product rather than the day moisturizer, because the day lotion contains chemical sunscreens that irritate sensitive skin."
"This product is amazing! I don't know how I ever got along without it, my foundation even goes on much nicer in the morning because of using this product, will definitely be using long term!"
I have been using this night cream for the past 2 nights after my friend gave it to me because she didn't like it. And my skin looks so smooth and good.
"When this was discontinued I was so sad and I was super happy when it was brought back, it's the only cream that I have used that makes my skin look so calm and great."
"I love this product and I've been using it for some time now but as other reviewers have noted, it is becoming more difficult to find at local stores. Please do not discontinue this product!!!"
"I bought this lotion because my skin has been incredibly dry lately. Whenever I use this lotion, my face burns, and I have to wash it off. I thought this would be great since it is ""calming."" It's definitely not a good match for my skin."
"Thank You for bringing the Ultra Calming night cream back, there was no substitute, it is absolutely the best at calming any redness or flakey/patchy areas."
I put this lotion on one night and woke up with my eyelids gigantic and swollen. My entire face was extremely dry and full of ezcema. This is supposed to be for sensitive skin. When I put into on my face stung too.
"I recently started using this cream. Like its name, it is calming for my skin during the allergy season. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This product is amazing! I have fair, sensative skin that tends to have a red tone and this cream works wonders for my skin. It is the only cream I use on my face. It works!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The good stuff - is gentle, did not have a reaction or redness. Can even use it during the day - not thick or gooey . Other stuff - does not seem as though it does anything, but just not make you red. I am combination skin, perhaps someone with a dry skin would be better."
"Please buy this so they keep making it! After I stopped buying an expensive moisturizer because the cost was too high, my skin was in revolt. It was dry, and irritated, and I had dermatitis. After trying several options, I decided to try an Aveeno product because I use their body lotion. I'm so glad I tried it! I use the whole ultra calming line, and my skin is happy as can be. This was my first time using a night cream (I'm 29), and the deep hydration feels so good!"
I love this line of products. Absorbs wonderfully into the skin and hydrates well.
"I have extremely sensitive skin. In the winter it gets so bad that even putting on very mild moisturizers feels like I'm rubbing acid on my skin. This is the one thing that I can use that manages not to hurt me at all and actually feels really nice, it has a consistency like a combination of a gel and a cream. I highly recommend to those with sensitive and non-sensitive skin alike."
"I purchased this and originally loved how lightweight it felt but after using it for sometime I didn't notice any positive changes in the appearance of my skin! It also caused me to break out all over my chin and on the sides of my face. I was very disappointed as it seemed like a promising moisturizer but this is is the second Aveeno moisturizer that irritates my skin, their products just don't seem to work for me."
I truly love this brand. Its really helped with my major dry/redness skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product has definitely helped with the redness on my face! I definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
One of the best products I have ever used will definitely purchase again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It helped with my dry skin during pregnancy! I love it.
I recently started using this night cream for about 1 week. I love it leaves my skin very soft and smooth. totally will keep using this product.
The ONLY night cream that doesn't cause my sensitive skin to break out. Please don't ever discontinue this line of products!!! Love it!
I love that it is paraben free. I cannot use your other products because I am allergic to soy and dairy. This is excellent!!!!
Very creamy and non greasy. Haven't used it long enough to see if it helps my sensitive skin but it for sure isn't hurting!!!
Super light but very moisturizing. Did not aggravate my rosacea. My new favorite moisturizer for night and day.
Got this for my 65 year old mommy and she seems to love it. Keeps asking for refills so I am happy it's working for her!!
This is the only cream that my face does not react to. It moisturizes very well and the skin does not look greasy. I use it during the day as well.
"I've always brought expensive products, but since I started using this line (foam cleanser, daily moisturizer, and night cream) things improved waaaay more."
"I like this product a lot (no parabens I can see on the label and no fragrance) and it works really well. However, other products made by Aveeno do have those which is unfortunate as they are known allergens."
This product is really great one. It sooths skin and calms it down. Like a balsam or repairing serum. I highly recommend it. I do have some dryness and red patches issues but this takes care of it all. Thank you ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product had my skin feeling hydrated. Now that we're getting into the winter months, it's exactly what I needed. I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its ULTRA CALMING® NOURISHING NIGHT CREAM to review."
"Aveeno Ultra Calming Nourishing Night Cream was a great addition to my nightly skin routine. It was a little thicker than I was used to with a night cream, but I would wake up with skin still soft. It has no scent so great for everyone's skin needs or for those with sensitive skin. I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its ULTRA CALMING® NOURISHING NIGHT CREAM to review."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its ULTRA CALMING® NOURISHING NIGHT CREAM to review.” I really like the night cream so far. It absorbs well into my skin and leaves it feeling really soft in the mornings. I also haven't had issues with breakouts yet. My only minor complaint is that it makes my t zone oily, but that happens with pretty much every moisturizer I use. Can't win there. Love the product though and will likely purchase it."
"The Aveeno active naturals ultra calming nourishing night cream I tried was very smoothing and it added a lot of moisture to my face. The first time I applied it, I felt a sense of coolness on my face. It was a light moisturizer that worked well to help my face look refreshed in the morning. I received this product to try for free from crowtap, my review and words are my own."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its ULTRA CALMING® NOURISHING NIGHT CREAM to review. I have a sensitive skin. I love how this cream moisturizes and reduces the redness on my face. My skin felt smooth and nourished. I love this cream and recommened it."
"I was given a sample to test and I must say, it moisturizes my face very very well. The weird thing is I always try many moisturizers but it always either oils up my face and makes my pores super big or leaves it dry and flaky. There is no way to find a great one. So far this is so good . It leaves my face soft and supple even early in the mornings. I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its ULTRA CALMING® NOURISHING NIGHT CREAM to review."
The redness across my checks and nose has diminished.
The low price is also a bonus
Had problems with my face breaking out. Started using this about 2 yrs ago
"Light, soothing. Don't care for scent, but it doesn't linger."
Not as moisturizing as I would have hoped but still pretty good. Goes on nicely with no scent.
"I love this product! It moisturizes the red chapped dry skin and leaves the face smooth and soothed. It does "" calm"" the skin."
awesome night cream not greasy and very moisturizing I woke up to a nice fresh face with this night cream very calming for my skin which is sensitive thanks i found this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The night cream is great for women of all ages. It has a calming-formula in which you can sleep with and wake up refreshed. It's great for helping to keep your face free from blemishes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was suffering from awful dry, scaling skin on my face that I was trying to treat with multiple applications of my regular facial moisturizer. I got the Aveeno night cream and as soon as I applied it my skin felt better. I've been using it for a couple weeks now and my skin looks so much better and feels softer. At first I applied the cream twice a day to treat my really dry areas but now I only need to use it once and my skin feels great."
Aveeno Ultra-Calming Night Cream is a terrific product. My overly sensitive dry skin drank in the cream immediately with no redness occurring even one hour later. This is the only product that has not turned me beet red and believe me I have tried a wheel barrow full of products over the years! I will definitely be a repeat buyer I love this product!
"I've been using Aveeno products for a while, so when I needed a new night cream for my super sensitive skin, this is naturally where I turned. Ultra-calming sounded great, but unfortunately had the opposite effect for me. Blotchy, red, itchy, bumpy skin is what greeted me in the morning. I gave it a high rating for effectiveness, because my skin is NOT dry anymore. At least I've got that going for me. Very disappointed. :("
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its ULTRA CALMING® NOURISHING NIGHT CREAM to review and I fell in love with this product. It leaves my skin feeling soft and I noticed within a few days the redness to my face was actually fading away. I found my new go to night cream."
"I'm always reluctant to try new creams because I have sensitive skin and break out easily, but this night cream is perfect! I don't break out and it leaves my skin feeling smooth. It doesn't feel heavy on my face and I also love that it's fragrance free."
"This moisturizer made me break out in cyst like bumps, about five or six. Ive been using this for about two weeks and just noticed them about three days ago. I've had this type of reaction from other Aveeno facial products fiends some reason. Not a fan."
"Like the name suggests, this is a very nourishing night cream. I have dry patches on my skin and I find that this cream helps moisturize those spots. My mom seems to also enjoy this night cream. Also love how its unscented [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I'm on the fence about the AVEENO® ULTRA-CALMING® NOURISHING NIGHT CREAM. I've only been using it for about 10 days so I haven't noticed any visible change in my skin. The cream doesn't have any strong odor, which is good. It goes on feeling very heavy, but eventually dries leaving my skin feeling soft and not looking greasy. I can't say whether I would recommend it yet since I haven't been using it long enough to notice any results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary from crowdtap for an unbiased review. The night cream has a light pleasant scent and it didn't bother my highly sensitive skin.

This one, however, had a almost neutral to waxy scent to it that I didn't like too much."
