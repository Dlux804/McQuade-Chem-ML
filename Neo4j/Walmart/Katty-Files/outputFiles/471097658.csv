My skin tone is glowing and very evident we n tone since I been using this product.
"VERY greasy but i have insanely dry skin with acne/dry spot scarring and as long as you keep up with this regularly-it works incredibly. It has completely changed my skin for the better. I use it at night so the greasy aspect doesnt bother me. Smells very old lady like but again, worth it!"
I really wanted to try this on my hands but the overwhelming smell just was too much. I gave it away to a friend but they didn't care for it either. I work skincare companies would make more skin friendly fragrance free products.
Don't care for this at all . Hard to get out. Shipping was good.
