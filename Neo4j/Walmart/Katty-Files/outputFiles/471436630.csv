"The benefits of Olay Whip are manifold, checking off all the criteria on my list of things that I look for when shopping for skincare products! Its active ingredients restore essential nutrients and moisture to my skin, and it absorbs quickly to help brighten my skin tone with its lightweight, smooth matte finish."
This moisturizer is absolutely amazing. I have very sensitive dry skin and have tried numerous things to try to help that. With just the very first use of Olay total effects my skin was beautifully transformed! It feels so good on the skin and does everything it promises and it also has just a nice light scent! I've never been happier! I'd highly recommend this product to anyone!
First time use of this particular Olay product and find it to be a positive experience. It is light and smooth on the skin and absorbs immediately leaving no greasy feeling. I have used Olay products for years but wanted to try the new whipped version. This is a good choice.
Left my face feeling soft not greasy like some spf creams
I never write reviews because quite frankly I never love a product but this is definitely my new favorite. I bought this a month or two ago and used it every day and night. I had light acne scarring and a little discoloration and after purchasing my second bottle of it I woke up one day and saw it was barley there anymore. Not only that but this does not make me breakout.It is definitely a little pricey for drugstore but I love its results.
"I am 27, acne-prone skin. I used the total effects before, it didn't live up to the hype and was overpriced. I decided to try this, and I am glad I did! First off, the price, while steep, a little goes a long way. Been on same jar over a month. It improved the look of my skin. I've notice acne scars fading and the overall look of my skin seems to glow. Fourth, it keeps my skin hydrated without an afternoon oil landmine. Fifth, it is a light refreshing scent that is actually soothing. A must try."
"It's so light feeling, unlike any other moisturizer I have ever used. This is definitely my favorite and will continue to purchase."
"I use different Olay products & some I stay with while others I replace to try others. Olay Effects Whip will definitely be a keeper. It's light, silky and applies easily. It has a fresh, light aroma. There was no sticky feel after applying but a softness not usually found with moisturizers. My skin felt soft and smooth, even after a few hours. I haven't used it long enough to see any visual effects yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was somewhat disappointed in this product. The Texture is soft and silky, glides on beautifully however I am not a fan of matte finish. I prefer a slightly dewy sheen. The list of ingredients were superb for a woman my age. I was surprised one of the ingredients included fragrance which I found very strong in scent as well as as a stinging sensation when applied to my skin. Fragrance is alchol based and a known irritant. I have used Total Effects in the past with great results."
"i bought this cream a month ago as i saw a commercial on tv. the cream absorbs very quickly to your skin which is awesome, however i am using alot of cream for my face and neck compared to what i have used with other products. my skin does not feel smoother and it does have a nice glow. i would recommend looking for a different product."
Feeling hydrated on my face. Smooth like silk. Glad i have tried it and will again.
It felt like sunscreen and reminded me of sunscreen. It also burned my face for the first few minutes of putting it on.
"For the price, I don't feel like this moisturizer is any different than the Olay 7 in 1 that I've used for a few years. It didn't leave a matte finish which is what I was looking for. For reference I have combination skin. I will be switching back to the Olay 7 in 1 :)"
"The SPF on this ""Whip"" is mediocre. At first, I thought it smelled great and went on easily. However, after a few uses, I noticed it started to flake and ""pill"" on my skin (I have combination-to-dry skin and have used numerous sunscreens as well as high-end skin care products for many years). Disappointed........."
"I received a free product for an honest review, and I was not disappointed! Although I suffer from dry skin year round, I do not like my facial moisturizer to make my skin feel greasy. This product is surprisingly light and after about 10-15 minutes on my face, I noticed a difference in the feeling of my skin. An added bonus is that this stuff smells amazing!"
I wanted a moisturizer with spf that wasn't too heavy and this fit the bill. The product applies evenly without the feeling that you are applying the heaviness of suntan lotion. My only gripe: the plastic tip underneath the lid. I felt like I was breaking into Fort Knox. It does not come off easily and the little bud on top does not make for ease of removal. I throw out the plastic top after fighting with it for the third frustrating time.
I have tried everything for my face and I have never come across a lotion like this. I have a couple of very dry patches on my face that I have never been able to tame. This is the first lotion that I can use morning and night and is the perfect combination of moisture. My dry patches have been rescued! Love it!! So relieved to finally find something that is perfect for me!
I got a sample of this and used for a week and noticed it does a very good job of moisturizing. I have purchased very high priced moisturizers in the past and this product (the Light As Air Finish) seems to be working just as well and I don't need to spend a fortune. Would recommend to my friends.
"I like the feel of this moisturizer but I use the regenerist red jar and other than the light feel, I don't see much difference. Both do minimize wrinkles a bit. By the way, I thought I didn't receive it but in fact I did...found it was wrapped up as a Christmas gift!!! Lol. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay Total Effect Whips Moisturizer will be my all time moisturizer. It is very light. Has SPF 25 which is so important. It does not leave your face feeling greasy even after a hard workout. It has vitamins C & E which is very beneficial to your face. Overall great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product leaves my face soft as I imagine clouds are. I love the feel of my face, no rough spots. I have only been using it a few days but I would definitely recommend. It is very light, no heaviness or greasy feeling like other products have left behind. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this product makes your face fill silky and smooth. I used it for a couple weeks and my face looks great. Skin color evened out,smooth some wrinkles. I really like this product and would change my current olay product to this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The fragrance is very fresh and light and does not linger. I found that it is very quickly absorbed with no left over accumulation and the benefit was so much quicker than Regenerist. This will now be my product of preference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This light weight whipped face cream feels wonderful on my face. It has a pleasant fragrance and I noticed right away that it leaves my skin looking more even toned. My skin tends to get a little bit oily during the day but hours later my skin still looked good and not greasy. I love this new product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used Oil of Olay products since I was 18. I didn't notice any change in my skin the few times I used it. I do like Oil of Olay products, but will only use what I think benefits my skin. I will be returning this in it's entirety and please cancel any other shipments as of 12/10/17. Thank you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product makes your face feel amazing. It is like body butter for your face. It makes your face soft, silky and smooth. It is very rich and I use it with and without my makeup. Keeps my face hydrated all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Goes on smoothly, skin feels so silky. It absorbs really fast and no oily look. I love how it makes my skin look and feel. But I have dry, mature skin, I'm 63 years old , for myself will probably stick with the regenerist products they help more for my skin issues. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I get up early in the morning to go to work, I don't have time to wait for my moisturizer to absorb into my skin. I liked that this cream let me quickly do my morning routine. My skin feel soft and I noticed a more even skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the Olay Total Effects face lotion in the pump bottle for years. I was excited to be able to try this new whipped product before buying! The whipped is just as effective as the pump version, but easier to apply, and seems to go on smoother. It still has the light fragrance that I love. I will definitely buy this product in the future! Thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was amazed because I have very dry skin and this is a whip product. I am not surprised although because it is an Olay product which speaks volumes of effectiveness, quality and great pricing. I used it without my other Olay products to see how it would do stand-alone and it rocked! My skin was thouroughly moisturized and felt great all day. Definitely will buy again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay has out done it in the moisture world!!! Feels and smells like a body butter for your face. Light as air, doesn't feel all heavy on your face. I love the way my face feels and looks after a week of usage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Haven't used this product for very long so its difficult to say how well it works. I've tried almost every product on the market and nothing has helped diminish wrinkles or dark spots. The WHIP feels nice on my skin and is very rich. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product has a softness that I enjoy on my face. It isn't greasy or gritty on my face, which is a big plus for me. The smell is not overwhelming as well. Although I have only been using the product for a week it gets two thumbs up from me. As always Olay has outdone their selves again! Thank you for the opportunity to try your wonderful product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the feel of the product. I have used it every morning and every night for 7 days. It doesn't take much to cover the surface of my face. I love the way my skin is feeling and would recommend this product to anyone. I've have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is amazing creme because after applying to your face it serves it so smooth that you do not need to put on foundation to make your face look smooth and clear. Just this product will make you look amazingly smooth and clear face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The cream is so silky & it makes my face soft, yet my skin can breathe & It smells really nice too. I tried using regular Olay before, which didn't seem like it was doing anything, but I decided to give it another try for a few weeks & I think I'm seeing a real difference in my skin. I need more time to be sure but, This Olay Total Effects Whips makes me optimistic that my skin will improve & I'm looking @ my skin now hopeful, because of the way it looks & feels!

"Great to have a product that has good spf protection but is absorbed without leaving white deposits-beautiful pearlized gold appeal in jar,another must have product from my go to product line!!Love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
If we start when we are young caring for our skin when we are older we will be happy to look younger than our years. This is a very nice cream-light scent which I appreciate. The cream goes on nicely and absorbs quickly. I will need to give it more time to be able to comment about how well it makes your skin look regarding dark spots and fine lines. I like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I wish had been able to receive the Regenerist version of this product because that's the line I use...but so far this moisturizer feels delightfully light upon application - not pore clogging or too oily. A bit soon to rate effectiveness, but my skin looks soft after use. And no breakouts, which some moisturizers with SPF can cause. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love the feel on my face smooth and not greasy at all makes you feel soft and smooth without feeling heavy very lite under your makeup great as a night time moisturizer clean feeling when you wake up. I think in the long run using it will keep my skin with a moist look and feel [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked this product. Goes on smooth and not greasy. You can barely feel is on your skin. Leaves my skin very soft. You only have to use very little to get great results. Which I loved! I really love the SPF 251 I still LOVE my Olay Regenerist!!! I [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love the product. It's a very creamy, silky feeling going on your skin. It has the faintest, very nice smell to it. Absorbs quickly and doesn't leave any kind of residual sticky feeling. I would buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Was glad to try this and it did not break me out like most other moisturizers out there. It has a very soft touch and feels really silky smooth keeping my face well moistured this winter. Would buy again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product! Its light, whipped texture absorbs almost immediately. My face feels moisturized and nourished all day. It does not bother my sensitive skin at all and the matte finish is a nice touch! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried OLAY TOTAL EFFECTS WHIP FACE MOISTURIZER. I enjoyed the light smell of this product. As with most Olay products, it did wonders for my skin, reducing wrinkles and making my face feel so soft. The whipped consistency of the lotion was light enough to wear under make-up without affecting it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm someone who doesn't like the feel of heavy, greasy moisturizers, and will use just a tiny bit, so I'm so glad that Olay now has a light feeling moisturizer. The product feels great on application, absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling satiny smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way it feels, it's very light and silky as I apply it yet it performs like it would be a much heavier cream. It has a light scent, nothing irritating. I love the results, a smooth and even finish - I look and feel youthful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is so light feeling on my skin ~ I love it! Leaves my skin feeling soft & smooth! I've used Olay for a while & was very excited to try the new Whips version...It's great and I will defintely be using this one from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It may look like a heavy cream, but once it goes on your skin you will realize this is something else completely. It becomes light and refreshing on your skin but still moisturizes. Amazing, must try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far this product is excellent. It is so light it is like putting on nothing. Absorbs quickly, no greasy feel just a smooth feel. Lines are softening in a few weeks so long term should be great. Our air is dry in the desert so this adds moisture when not wearing makeup on top. Try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was ready for a change due to my changing skin, and thought I would try Regenerist. Then you sent this to me! In one week, my skin is softer to touch. Red rough patches on the sides of my eyes are gone!! The fragrance is wonderful! It feels so light and soft when applying it to your face. I will definitely change to Olay Total effects Whip. Thank you for making it."

"This product is amazing. It is so lightweight on your face you forget you even have it on. I love the texture of the cream, the way it makes my face look and the way it feels. It truly is light as air. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is not matte nor does it absorb quickly. So I would not recommend this for oily/combo skin types unless you wait considerable time for it to soak in before applying makeup. However, it leaves a nice feel to the skin and a lovely finish for makeup for drier skin types. I wish it did not come in a jar, since I don't know if the ingredients will remain stable over time.

"Happy with this product-higher spf often seem to settle in lines and creases-this one is invisible,absorbed well,looks amazing.Another winner from my product line of choice!Whips are beautiful in the jar too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have always used Olay Total Effects. I need a daily moisturizer that is hydrating and with an SPF to protect my skin against the sun. This beautiful SPF 25 whipped version has a very light weight feel and does the job! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First I want to say thank you for the generous sample. I have only been using it for about a week but I love it. It goes on so smooth and doesn't make my face feel oily. I use it morning and night on my face and neck. I have used other Olay products but this one is by far the best. Love the smell and the jar is very pretty also. Thanks again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product goes on smoothly and sinks in and leaves no greasy feeling. I have used oil of Olay lotion for many years and it leaves a greasy film on my eye glasses. I will purchase the whip facial moisture in the future. Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall, I'm impressed with the Olay Total Effects Whip. The product has a beautiful texture that absorbs into the skin quickly and the SPF 25 is a step up from the liquid/pump product. There is a light fragrance, but it's not unpleasant or overpowering. The only ""con"" is that it can take a little bit to figure out how much product to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have dry sensitive skin so I wasn't sure how this whip formula would work. I was pleasantly surprised. It smoothes on nicely and absorbs quickly, no greasy feel at all with only a slight sunscreen scent. It kept my skin very hydrated all day long. I found that it fills in my fine lines and pores nicely, too. I like that it has an SPF 25 to help protect against sun damage, and the lightweight formula would feel great on my skin in the summertime as well. So far I'm loving it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great moisturizer! Not too greasy but very moisturizing! My skin is part oily, part dry but more dry in the winter so this product is perfect! No scent either which is just what I'm looking for! I look forward to seeing how my skin does using this product long term! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product felt like I was applying whipped air it was so weightless. I've applied it several times and my wonderment never changes; how did they do that? I'm 65 and have been using Olay products since I was 16; I am loyal to this brand. It has helped keep me looking at lease 10 years younger than I actually am all these years. Keep it up Olay, I'm Olayloyal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Love this product. Goes on very well and disappears on the skin. I use Simply Ageless makeup and it goes on really well over the moisturizer. I have only used the product for a week, but it definitely will be a part of my daily regimen. Love Olay products. I have been using them for years.

"I have always used Olay products, but this Whip moisturizer feels like air on your skin. Unlike the creams and lotion (which is great) this feels different. I have not tried it long enough to comment on it effectiveness but if it works as it feels, then I would definitely recommend. By the way the scent is refreshingly heavenly.

The product felt light and fresh on my skin and didn't cause any issues in the humid Florida climate. Loves the scent. Might be a little too light for my skin but the other whipped products might meet that need. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I love this product because it is such a light cream that really hydrated. When I scooped it out, it reminded me of old fashioned cold cream, but it blends in smoothly and absorbs quickly so you can quickly apply makeup. I have dry skin and it is worse in the winter. I've been using this product now that it's cold and it works well. I love that there is SPF in it as well! Olay products never disappoint!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love everything about this product. I love how a little goes a long way. It makes my face feel smooth and smells great. Very light and fluffy. The only thing I did notice While putting on this product is that I shouldn't keep rubbing it in. It will leave a little bit of lotion flakes on my face (just wipe off lightly).

You would think by the name of the product that the cream would be lightweight. You would be wrong. This cream is much thicker and stickier than the same product in bottle. Just seems like a marketing gimmick. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I love the high SPF number. I am 70 years old and plan to use the Olay Total Effects Whip instead of foundation during the summer. I will use it under foundation during the short winter months. Living in a very hot humid climate in Texas, I have given up trying to find a foundation that lasts, but I need the moisture, SPF 25, and other benefits that Whip provides all in one jar. This product will definitely save me money. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
OLAY Total Effects Whip feels so light when applying to your face. A little will do you. My face feels smooth and softer after a week of usage. I feel like my skin can actually breathe with this OLAY moisture. The only problem I have is the protective lid getting it off. Once off you will find a fine product inside.

"Living in Florida, I am out in the sun constantly so being able to get an SPF25 in a light moisturizer is a bonus. Most sunscreens seal your pores and make me sweat, the Olay Whip doesn't seem to block my pores as much as a standard sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the feel of the product. It is soft and absorbs quickly. I have not noticed any changes in my skin yet, but have only been using for a week.

"This product is amazing. It is smooth to the touch. Keeps my face soft and smooth. It truly absorbs so fast. I can use my mineral makeup within a minute of applying this moisturizer.

So far your site advisor has told me that this product would be nice and light with no after greasy feeling and that is true. The only part that is to early to tell is my skin appearance. Will continue to use it and see the effects.
This product line is wonderful and makes your skin feel so soft. I have tried two of these and simply love them. I am going to try the third one and then pick my favorite. It totally evens up your skin tones. It is amazing and smells so good.
I've noticed a huge difference in my skin tone. I have very fair skin and my cheeks are usually blotchy red and after a couple weeks there was a noticeable even tone. This moisturizer is so light-weight and leaves my skin feeling soft and healthy.
Enjoyed the new whipped feel and the fresh scent. Can't wait to try some of the other whip products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
