"I have used many products. I'm 33, 3 kids in Florida. Just in the past few days my skin has changed drastically. It's softer and I'm using it with the rest of the system. The scent is so delicate and not overwhelming . It's just perfect . It's affordable and it works! What more can you ask for!"
wonderfru; makes a 60 year old face feall like a babie skin i wnt to jse mor ove it and would try other items like it. 5stars and millions os streamers.
"Just bought this cream a couple days ago, was excited to try a new nighttime regiment. After a couple nights of use my face is itchy, red, feels like sunburn and has a bumpy/leathery feel. I decided to check reviews to see if anyone else was having this reaction and it appears I'm not the only one! Super disappointed. :( I will no longer use."
"I was excited to try this after being happy with other Aveeno products. However, after using this nightcream I woke up with my eyelids completely swollen. Four days later i still I have huge bags under my eyes and they are still red, burning and are now peeling. I do not recommend this product."
"I didnt listen to the negative reviews bc historically i have never had sensitive skin and use other aveeno products no problem. But i also had a rash or something with skin warm to the touch a few days after use. My skin is now dry as it heals and as someone said, it feels like a sunburn; i would definitely agree with that. I'm hoping my skin heals bc its looking a bit leathery right now and has a slightly bumpy texture."
"Similar to others, I used this for 2 nights with no issue. I woke up after the 3rd night with a dry, stinging rash across my face. There at many small raised bumps and it feels as if I had sunburned and have small water blister under it. This is the only thing I have changed in my fave care routine. This product was expensive to buy, so I am quite disappointed. I am afraid to try the daily moisturizer I also purchased."
"Bought and was hoping would be a great product, but unfortunatkey otherwise. Broke out in severe rash all over my face and would not recommend for people with sensitive skin."
"After one night time application, I woke up with a rash all over my face. It felt like my face was on fire. I have always used Aveeno products and loved them, but this product was awful."
"I use absolutely ageless daily moisturizer fine, I decided to try the night cream, and woke up with extremely dry itchy skin with a rash. Needless to say I returned the product and will not be using this anymore"
"After three nights of using this product, I woke up with a red, burning rash all over my face and neck. It looks and feels like a severe sunburn. I have used other Aveeno products for years and this is the first time I've experienced any negative reaction."
Loved it
"Having used this product a few years ago for my neck and décolletage, with no ill effects and then continuing with other brands to see which one is best, I bought this night cream again. After the first night, I awoke with a red rash exactly where I used it. Don't know why I reacted this way, but I would not recommend this product for people with sensitive skin without using a spot test beforehand."
"I bought this product a week ago and used it two times. My face is now itchy, irritated, and has a red rash on it and feels like I got bad sunburn. Do not use this unless you want your skin to feel like you sat out on the beach all day without sunscreen. I will be returning this product."
I���ve bought this night cream hoping that it'll give my skin nourishment and moisture during night time.but instead of it just stays on your skin and peels off(((can't recommend it.i was disappointed
I've never had a reaction to skin cream and have used regular aveeno my whole life and love it. I was excited about this new night cream and have woken up three times now with red skin that feels like a sun burn. The next day it becomes slightly itchy...
Very good. Not greasy.
"I bought this product after ending a long expensive subscription to a celebrity skin care line. I was sick of paying so much and was no longer seeing any good effects. I immediatly saw results when i started this line, i'm happy with the price and that i can get it easily with my groceries. Its smells amazing and is exactly what i need at this stage in life. I got it with the eye cream and cant wait to get the serum."
"I purchased this a week ago and have been using it every night. My skin is soft and smooth and looks younger. I love this product, it smells great and feels cool when you first apply it. I will never be with out it. Plus it is more reasonable then similar products that don't work as well."
"I wouldn't really label my skin as overly sensitive, but this product caused more than a tingle... It burned my skin and lasted awhile after thoroughly rinsing it off. It's very uncomfortable, and for the price, I'm super disappointed."
"My skin is so soft and moisturized. Look younger, i've been using this and alot of other aveeno products for years, love them all. Even started using the hair products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Aveeno products for 15 plus years, the value, satisfaction with the product have all been consistent. I recently switched to this new night cream and I am pleased."
I was so excited to try this product as I have always loved aveeno. When I put the lotion on tonight it felt like it was burning and just ached right away. It was about 30 minutes after my throat started to feel dry and scratchy after reading the negative reviews I noticed im not the only one this happened to :(
"It goes on and doesn't feel greasy. I have been using this product for several years. It doesn't cause a rash when I use it, and does not dry out my skin or cause flaking. I wear no foundation and I'm 74 years old, and am often asked what I use on my face."
Bought this last week as the nightly aveeno moisturizer I normally use was out of stock. Figured I would try something different. It was a mistake. Face still itchy dry and peeling as a result of using product for 3 days.
I started using this on a Thursday night and by Saturday I felt a rash all over my face. I also felt flushed. By Monday morning I looked like I had a severe sunburn on my face in it was burning like fire. Will not be using it tonght. Was very disappointed.
I like a night cream that not only feels good but also contains ingredients that are good for my skin. This Aveeno cream contains vitamins C and E as well as antioxidants so it's a great drug store choice. My skin felt good the next morning without any greasiness or acne/irritation problems. I saw no miraculous changes to my fine lines and wrinkles but I believe keeping your skin healthy and moisturized overall is what helps with minimizing those problems.
"Love the feel and smell of this night cream. I have very dry and sensitive skin, so I must be careful which products I use. This moisturizer works great on my face. It feel smoother and looks brighter. While I know that it will not reduce my deeper wrinkles, it helps smooth the littler ones and hopefully will help prevent new ones(to some extent)."
"I'm sorry to say that after using this product for about a week, I broke out in 2 large pimples on my forehead ( or what I perceived as pimples). As I am in my sixties, I surely did not expect this reaction from a cream, especially one made by Aveeno, a brand I respect. I have stopped using it."
"I started using this product, and within the first day or two, my face began to burn and itch. I've quit using it but my face is red and looks like I've had some kind of chemical peel! I am terribly uncomfortable and waiting for this rash to settle down!"
I have always loved the Aveeno line and was excited to try the new restorative night cream. I am trying to prevent fine lines from forming and was researching which products to use. I tend to have oily skin and this moisturizer did not leave me feeling greasy. I awoke to soft and hydrated skin.
"I was in the market for a night cream, and so excited to use this product, I love Aveeno products, and have never had a problem with my skin. I put the cream on my face right before bed, and everything felt fine. I woke up the next morning with bumps all over my face (I never get pimples or bumps). My skin was literally purple, swollen, hot, and itchy. This is the second day of my reaction and it is still the same after taking benadryl, moisturizing, and putting ice on my face! Nothing is helping!"
I have been an Aveeno product user for years. Lately I had been so stressed and my skin started showing it. I seen this product at the store and decided to try it since it was new aveeno product. I started using absolutely ageless products and I love it! I have received lots of compliments on my skin! I love the way my skin looks and feels! It no longer looks as if I'm tired. I will continue to use this! ❤️❤️❤️❤️ Highly recommend
"I like Aveeno products and because of it i gave a try to the beauty products.After one night of applying it ,my face felt dryness, redness and swelling which I don't ever get on my face and I was a very ichy the next day. Went to see a doctor and he said a had rash. Had to use a hydrocortisone on my face and anti allergic pills. So disappointed!!! I don't have sensitive skin and never had a reaction to anything like this!"
"I have been using this night cream along with the daily moisturizer for about 10 days. After about a week, I went to an event with no makeup foundation on and two different people complimented me on my skin. I love the way my face feels and will continue with it. My complaint: Both products are intensely fragrant and it doesn't dissipate. If fragrances don't bother you, I recommend this night cream."
"I am a 70 year old who's NOT used sunscreen - remember baby oil and laying out in the sun. Plus I lived in the south over 25 years. So, I found myself with large age spots on face, redness, unrelieved dryness. After YEARS of trying many products, oh, and did I mention sensitivity to most ingredients, I tried this product. After six months I find, seriously, I look ten years better! I'm getting compliments on the improvements from friends. I won't go back to the expensive nor anything with retinol. I've found my face friend forever."
"I apply this every night before bed and feel like my skin is so soft and supple when I wake up in the morning. Plus it smells delicious! I wish it was available in a pump though, as these type of containers often make more bacteria because you dip your fingers in it repeatedly. But other than that I love this stuff and will continue to repurchase!"
I've been using this product along with all of the other Absolutely Ageless products for the face and love them all! My skin looks more youthful and is soft and smooth! The products smell wonderfully fruity as well... no chemical or perfume smell! Absolutely Awesome!
"The second night I used this product, I woke up with a red and puffy face. I have a minor rash on my neck. Would not recommend this product. I will be returning this to the store. I should have read the reviews before purchasing this product cause it seems like everyone is saying the same thing. If I was the company I would pull this product until they can fix the issue."
I totally love this night cream. I love how soft my face is after using it and how soft it still is the next morning. I also use it on my dry elbows. I got a sample in my beauty box and intend on getting more when I've used all of the sample. Wonderful stuff! #walmartcontest
"I typically apply a moisturizer at night after washing my face and decided to try Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream one night. The difference was really noticeable! I applied it and immediately felt my skin soak it up, becoming smooth and silky. There was no residue at all. I'm really impressed with the quality and performance of this cream!"
"I don't normally post reviews, but when I saw the other posts, I felt it necessary to affirm what other people are saying. Last night I tried this cream for the first time, and when I woke up, my face was bright red. It was as if I'd been sunburned, and several hours later, I'm still at work feeling miserable because my face is so hot. I haven't had a reaction this bad since I was thirteen. Having read the other posts, I'm starting to feel lucky all I got was redness. Don't try this cream; it's not worth taking the chance."
"I used this product 3 times in 7 days and now my face looks sunburned. My face and neck are itchy and peeling. I also have tiny whiteheads on my nose and chin. I've never had a reaction to a moisturizer before. I wish I'd done some research before purchasing. So many negative reviews, some going back 2 years."
"I love other Aveeno products and blackberries is one of my favs so I was excited to try this. After one night felt dryness, which I don't ever get on my face and I was a little ichy the next day. But I thought maybe it was just a fluke, so I gave it one more night of use and now the rash feeling is on my face and neck and ichy. I'm done, never again! So disappointed!!! I don't have sensitive skin and never had a reaction to anything like this!"
"Purchased this recently and am very happy with the results. My skin is somewhat dry, and this product provides me with just the right amount of moisture--my skin sucks it right up. Love the scent, too. Definitely not greasy, which I appreciate. I will most definitely keep on purchasing it."
"After using this product, I developed red, itchy bumps on my face. I have now stopped using the product and the bumps are gone. I also noticed that my skin burned a little every time I put it on. I tried using this product for two weeks and was not happy with the results."
"I used this product once and the next morning my face and neck were puffy, itchy and red! It took about 4 days for it to go away. I've never had an allergic reaction to a facial product before so I was very surprised for this to happen. I've tried calling customer service but I am always on hold for too long."
"I currently love the creamy clear complexion face wash. I was in search of a night cream. I woke up the next morning to a swollen, red face. Still two days later and my face is swollen and red, but in addition has small whiteheads, which I have never had before. It looks like this is a common problem."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review. This night cream is really good. Even after 7-8 hours of sleep, my skin is still feeling soft. Perfect for cold climate areas."
"After using for 3 days, I have a rash of tiny bumps all over my face."
This is a wonderful cream that I had not tried before and I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Glad to find this product at a great price. My whole transaction was easy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is wonderful. I would recommend this to everyone. It leaves my face feeling good. It's not greasy and it absorbs into the skin well [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I will buy more I love it my skin I looks young and beautiful [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My face broke out the morning after using this cream! Applying this product was the only change in my skin care routine. Super bummed because I love Aveeno lotions and have never had a problem before. I won't be using this product anymore
I was super exited to try the new aveeno night and day cream.
"However, my face broke out and I am very disappointed . I have never broken out like this before! I use other aveeno products and I have no complaints."
"I tried this product for two days and my face got red, itchy and swollen. I like their body lotions and I've used other face moisturizers but this one caused a terrible reaction and my skin isn't usually sensitive...Ugh!"
"I started this cream last night and woke up with a red rash over my cheeks, nose and chin. Looks like a bad sunburn (I was not in the sun yesterday). I use other Aveeno products, but I can not use this one."
"Within a very short time, my deep crow feet lines by eyes softened to where they are no longer visible. This product is worth trying to see if it works for you. Money well spent!"
"After receiving this in my winter beauty box, I ran out and purchased it at Wal-Mart. I absolutely love it and got compliments on my skin after wearing it a week!"
"I always loved Aveeno products, so trusted the quality when I purchased absolutely ageless this weekend. Now after only 2 nights of use, I woke up with a bright red and swollen face along with a rash down my neck."
"I bought this product. I used it the same night, and next morning my skin was so soft. I have sensitive skin, and no breakouts at all. I will continue using this Aveeno Ageless products. I love it."
I love all Aveeno and use the moisturizer every day so I got the new night cream and with in 3 days my skin looked like it has been burned I have quit using it .
I love aveeno and will use the products just don't know what happened with this one !
I love Aveeno products and add the convenience of home delivery. Fabulous!
it is great since I have sensitive skin.
"After the second night of using this night cream, I woke up with red, itchy, dry skin - almost like an allergic reaction. I immediately stopped use, but it took almost a week for my skin to return to normal. I use Aveeno Positively Radiant moisturizer, and I was really excited about using this night cream, but unfortunately my skin did not react well to it at all."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a sample of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Intensive Renewal Serum to review. I loved this product, it went on light, it didn't feel heavy on my skin and it absorbed well so there was no greasy feeling left. I will purchase this product again"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.I love the way this cream makes my face feel after I apply it at night.It has a creamy light feel that has a great light scent.It makes my face feel hydrated and soft.My face is so soft in the morning and the lines appear to be less noticeable."
"I bought this cream last week. I used it twice and my cheek is now covered with acne like bumps. I don't know if it's “renewing” my skin but after reading what others say, I'm hesitant to keep using it. I never have break outs on my cheeks. Maybe this is normal, but I've never had a moisturizer cause this issue."
"Add me to the list of those who had a reaction; it's the first time I have ever reacted to a skin care product. When I woke up the next morning after my first (and only use), my face & neck looked and felt like they had been badly sunburned ... bright red, swollen and hot to the touch."
"Similar to others here, this cream gave me a dry, itchy rash on my cheeks and chin after just two nights of using it. My skin also developed small clogged pores resembling whiteheads. I have somewhat sensitive skin but no product has ever caused a reaction like this! Not sure what is in this but definitely not a gentle cream - proceed with caution!"
"I am pleased with the results of using the Restorative Night Cream. I applied it after the Renewal Serum. It dried quickly leaving my skin soft. The Night Cream left no sticky residue as it felt like there was nothing there! I felt good waking up and feeling great! I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review."
"I love how this feels on my skin. I have been using a retinol product and this felt so soothing compared to that. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.”"
"I have dry skin and have looked for a moisturizer that doesn't ""go dry"" on my skin a few hours after I apply it. This one was great."
"love,love,love..I'm an Esthetitian and tried this night cream . I will for sure be continuing using this product"
Im so glad i pick this product up in target 3 days ago and i have 2 nights applying it. My skin feel soft and healthier and firmer.
"After two days of use, my skin itches and burns and it so dry that I am peeling. I stopped using it and now I don't know what to use on my face."
"Very disappointed. This cream felt so good upon application. After two nights of use, I developed small white heads and mild redness on my face."
"I've used this cream since it was first introduced. I like it a lot. It's not greasy, goes on easily and lasts awhile."
"My dermatologist recommended it to me, and I have always used Aveeno products and been very happy. You can feel how good it works in just a couple of weeks. I love it"
"Do not use this. I have had great experiences with Aveeno products in the past, but this one caused me to break out in hives all over my face. It is two days later, and they are still not gone."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review. I was so happy to discover my new favorite night cream. It is AMAZING! It makes my skin soft, smooth, great moisturizer, and smells fantastic! I am in love with this product! Thank you Aveeno and Crowdtap!"
"I've had a really positive experience with Aveeno's other night creams, but I tried this one for the first time and my whole face is now peeling like I have a sunburn and my skin is red in patches. I've never reacted to a moisturizer this way before! It's kind of shocking. I also bought another ""firming"" Aveeno skin cream that leaves my skin dry and makes my skin sting. Maybe Aveeno needs more product testing? It's disappointing because I was a big fan."
"Received a sample of this night cream in my beauty box. The first thing I noticed was the strong scent. I don't like my face products to have strong scents but I tried it anyway. The first night I used it, it moisturized my skin nicely. The next morning my skin was soft. So I used it again the next night. The next morning my face was broken out. I'll stick to my St Ives."
"I'm always on the look out for an evening cream and I have to say I do like this, I like the smell it doesn't leave my skin feeling heavy or greasy. BUT it does however tingle and leaves my cheeks flushed and next morning have a few blemishes. So I had to discontinue. This may not happen to others just reporting what happened to me. It is rather expensive as well so try to get a sample if you can."
"Im a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno rewards program and Aveeno sent me a sample of its Aveeno absolutely ageless restorative night cream free for my review. Although it is to soon to tell if my fine lines will be totally diminished by this product it is soothing on the skin, not greesy, and has a pleasant scent. I like it and recommend."
I used this product for the first time thanks to my Walmart beauty box sample and loved it. With previous products my face felt dry and tight or greasy and would get into my eyes. Not Aveeno's Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream. My face feels light and moist but not greasy.
I'm a member of the Crowdtap Aveeno rewards program and Aveeno sent me a sample of its Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream. I looked forward to putting this on my face each night. It wasn't sticky and didn't dry out my skin. It felt soothing go on my skin and left me feeling that great things were in store for my face during the night. I did notice the fine lines on my face were beginning to fade.
"AVEENO Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream has really made a difference with making my skin smoother and helping with fine lines. I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO rewards program, and AVEENO sent me a sample of its AVEENO Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream to review."
I'm a member of the CROWTAPS Aveeno rewards program and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO�� Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.” I love using this in combination the the Absolutely Ageless renewal serum. It makes my skin so soft and helps to diminish my fine lines as I sleep. Love it
"Aveeno night time cream is working for me while I sleep.im not getting younger ,I want to look as young as I can for as long as possible and this is making it possible, making my skin soft and smelling great,fighting wrinkles, circles and sights of aging."
"Aveeno absolutelyageless restorative night cream goes on very smooth. It is not greasy. In the morning my skin feels so soft and healthy. I really like how it does not clog the pores or cause pimples by morning. My skin does not feel dry in the morning either. I really like this Aveeno night cream. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review."
"I usually use an expensive brand of night cream, but I'll make the switch to this one. I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review. It's much lighter than my current brand and I think does as good of a job of reducing fine lines and wrinkles the next day. I used it with the serum they sent. I applied that first then the night cream. The savings will be dramatic and my skin will be radiant."
"I really loved this night cream! It went on smoothly and didn't make my skin feel greasy at all. I loved how soft my skin felt the next morning as well. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.”"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review. I am very happy I got the chance to try this product. It makes my skin feel instantly softer and smoother. It feels cool absorbs well into my skin without feeling greasy. I like the fresh scent and my skin felt soft and moisturized long after applying it to my face."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.” I have not used night cream before but I really like it. It is not oily and my skin feels wonderful in the morning."
I used this twice and ended up with a rash. Had to see my dermatologist!
I love this night cream I use it every night and on my neck and hands before bed time.
"This product left my face red, patchy, and peeling. Its absolutely horrible,"
"this face cream moisturizes overnight, seems to get get rid of wrinkles ad stop more from appearing"
It's light and not greasy. Does the job that I need. I always trust Aveeno.
I feel the difference with the cream. Would buy again.
I love the way it makes my face feel...very soft and smells amazing!
"I usually love aveeno products, but this one broke me out in hives on my face. Naturally, the store won't take it back because I've used it."
I've been using Absolutely Ageless for at least a year and I love these products. My skin is soft and I am very happy with how it looks and feels.
The Aveeno Active Naturals absolutely ageless restorative night cream worked overnight to bring my dry skin back to life. This lightly scented cream deeply moisturized my face without being greasy or heavy. Can't wait to get more.
I would definitely buy this night cream and would highly recommend. I have been using for about a week every night and it doesn't make my face feel greasy or cause breakouts. Thanks Aveeno. #walmartcontest
"AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream has really helped my skin look better. I just put on a little before I go to sleep in the evening. I wake up looking fresh without bags under my eyes, and having brighter, fresher skin."
I love waking up to my skin feeling refreshed after a night of sleep. This product is perfect for those winter nights when the house is dry. I am adding this to a must have list! Thanks Aveeno
"This is a excellent nightcream. I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a sample of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Intensive Renewal Serum to review.”"
Aveeno has helped me transform my dry skin to lovely soft radient skin. Aveeno is an excellent product. I love the day serum and the SPF that keeps my skin protected from UV rays. The night cream is equally an awesome product.
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a sample of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Resorative Night Cream to review.” I love this product and will tell all my friends about it."
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review. I like this product, it is non greasy which I love. It is light and creamy. It is scented, but nothing heavy. I haven't used it long enough to notice any effect with my wrinkles. I will continue to use it, working well for dry winter skin."
"I have consistently used this cream for a week. I have sensitive, combination skin, so I avoid putting it on my T-zone. But my wrinkles around my eyes have significantly reduced over the past week. I'm in my early 30s, so they are pretty much faint wrinkles, not deep by any means. But the night cream has reduced the appearance. I noticed when I put on my makeup, I don't have to use as much consealer. It also doesn't bother my skin at all."
"Without a strong scent or stickiness, this lotion glides on easily and does not feel greasy on my skin. It soaks in quickly. I've been using the lotion for several nights and my skin does look more glowing and not quite as tired. Glad this sample was in my Wal-Mart Beauty Box!"
"Worked to provide moisture to my skin, and quickly absorbed. Definitely did not contribute to any blemishes. Used in conjunction with the daytime cream, but didn't notice any real difference to my skin. Tone remained the same, and pores looked the same as well. Not too wrinkled, but didn't seem to make much difference there nonetheless. The ""raspberry"" scent is definitely not my idea of nice, though it dissipates within a short time."
"I have received a decent sample size of this night cream and I love it. the sample size is 14g, enough to use for more than a week. the cream goes on smooth, it may appear a little shiny at first but it absorbs quickly. In the morning skin is soft and moisturized.It is very lightly scented, which I like since I am allergic to fragrance in cosmetic products. It is a bit too soon to express myself on the anti-wrinkle properties of the cream, but I love that is moisturizing.No breakout-causing, yey!"
I like the Aveeno brand because they don't test on animals. So i was excited to see they had this night cream. I tried it for a couple of nights and i didn't really notice any change. It says it takes a week to work so i'll give it a little more time. #WalmartContest #Aveno #brewbroadblog
"I am not a believer in thinking any cream or lotion will ever get rid of wrinkles and/or age spots or make my 50 year old self look 20. This product does feel good going on at night, not greasy. And I wake up with moistened not dry skin. Again I don't wake up looking 20 or 30 but my skin feels good."
I have used some other Aveeno products and so I was happy to try out this product. This makes me skins feel radiant and very well nourished when I wake up. I have especially noticed the skin on my neck seems to be more toned. I plan to buy a full size of this product! #walmartcontest
This is a great product for my sensitive skin. Works great!! I have really oily skin and I don't have to worry about it being greasy and just shiny in the morning. It's just perfect in the morning. My face doesn't break out with this product at all. I love this product. I really need to break down and purchase the product itself. I've been living off of samples for a while now. Lol!!!
"I first received this in a beauty box. I wear a cpap and the area around my nose gets very dry. The night cream has stopped that. Fabulous stuff. Smells great, the scent isn't too strong. Goes on smooth and silky, absorbs well. I love it. #walmartcontest"
"I tried this at night but I found that I now use it for a day moisturizer too, the reason being is because moisturizers with sunscreen irritate my skin, this is light and non greasy. If you use it in the daytime though be aware there is no SPF in it."
"I received a sample of this night cream in my Walmart Beauty Box. I have extremely sensitive skin so am very careful when trying a new product on my face, but this cream was so gentle! It has a wonderful smell, is non greasy, and is a great moisturizer."
This is pretty solid as a night cream. It isn't thick at all and absorbs well. I have very sensitive skin and haven't had any reactions so far. My one complaint is that the cream is more fragrant than I'd like. Smelly face products always make me a little nervous about the chemical smells they're trying to hide.
"Great nightly cream for summertime use. Not strong enough to combat skin that tends to run dry or for skin that really suffers during cold weather. Didn't cause any breakouts or itchy skin, which is always a plus. There wasn't a noticeable reduction in tiny lines or wrinkles, though it was nice to wake up without skin feeling parched or like there was a weird film on it (like as has happened with some creams and lotions I've tried). Biggest wish is that Aveeno would ditch the additives like unnecessary fragrance"
"First off, I am a huge Aveeno fan. This was my first time trying Aveeno absolutely ageless restorative night cream and I love it! I used this cream on my face and neck. It went on smoothly and was absorbed into my skin immediately. The lotion did not leave a greasy feeling behind. Nor did it make me break out like some creams. I will be buying this product again!"
"I have about given up on ""wrinkle creams"" and ""youth restoratives"". They sting. Or they are greasy. or the smell rotten. Or they get all over my pillowcase."
"I like this product. It took a few days to feel results, but at least I didn't suffer the usual disappointments. I will keep using Aveeno!"
"I absolutely love this product! From the amazing texture and thickness to the smell, this product will surprise you! I have several different night creams ranging from expensive name brands to cheap knock offs, but none of them seem to work as well as this one."
"I received this in my Walmart Beauty Box. I LOVE THIS STUFF! I have been using it for weeks now and every night that I use it I am so glad it was in the beauty box. I don't know about the ""younger looking"" claims because I wasn't paying attention to elasticity/firmness I was looking for hydration without the greasy/heavy feeling some night creams can have. This stuff feels like silk on my skin. It has a fantastic smell that doesn't linger/annoy and it is so light weight. This is my new night cream."
"The creamy texture and smooth feel was a cool touch to my face however you're never given enough to give it a true test but merely a teaser. The average is 3 months and we received maybe a 1 week portion. Would love to see results after time, and product received doesn't allow."
"I don't like putting heavy night creams on before I go to bed. My face feels hot and flushed and greasy. This cream did not do that and it still made my skin feel softer and more supple to the touch. I will purchase this cream in the future, definitely!"
I had been wanting to try the Aveeno anti- aging products. This night Creme was a great gate-way product . It has a great feel without being heavy or sticky. A little goes a long way and it has a lux. Texture. Pleasant smell and kept me hydrated. I will definitely buy and I want to try more of the line.
"I have been using this cream around my eye area and it has greatly ""plumped"" out my skin and smoothed it out. I still have my wrinkles, but they are less noticeable. I can feel it immediately soaking into my skin. I have diabetes so dry skin is an ongoing struggle."
I never used a night cream before this product that I actually like. I love the scent and the product is not oily on my face. In the morning my face feels so soft and smooth. I will continue to use this product. My only problem with the product is the price but so far I've been able to find coupons online.
I received this product in my first Walmart Beauty Box to trial. The cream has a pleasant scent and was not drying like some other products I've tried in the past and was lightweight on my skin.
I liked it so much that I actually used it as a day cream as well.
I received this as a sample in my Walmart Beauty Box. I have been jumping around on both day and night creams trying to find an affordable one that meets my needs. I was very happy with Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream. I will be buying this in the future. I also plan on trying their day cream.
"To be honest, I haven't used it more than 3 times because I had just purchased a different brand, but from what I was able to determine, it seems to do pretty well. It is in my travel bag as the only night product I use when I'm on the road. I will get more opportunities to try it out over the summer."
"As a big fan of Aveeno products and the Absolutely Ageless facial cleanser, this left me feeling kind of underwhelmed. In fairness, I only used the trial size so maybe I didn't give it enough time but all in all, I don't think I'll be buying the retail size."
I had used nothing at night before using this so I was starting with a clean pallet so to speak. I did notice after the first night that my skin felt softer in the morning when I put my day cream on. I'm not sure how other night creams work but I am very pleased with Aveeno.
"Applied on just washed face. Seemed a little thin for night cream, but did make face feel soft with a slight greasy feeling. Gently applied under eyes and around rest of face. Not sure the night cream actually made and appearance difference for facial spots or light wrinkles."
I absolutely love this line of products that Aveeno has put not. It is doing wonders for my skin of 50ish years. . Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream seems to help reduce the visible effects of elastin and collagen loss. I am also seeing a little more firmness to it.. I will continue to use for years to come if it keeps helping me like it has .
"This is the first time that I have ever used the entire trial size of anything and went back to purchase the full size. I love this night cream. It's light, smells great, and leaves my skin incredibly soft. I've noticed a difference in my skin with the use of this night cream and the daily moisturizer."
I like to watch ingredients in my products. This cream has vitamins C & E and antioxidants. It leaves my skin feeling soft but not greasy which I like. I haven't noticed any change in my fine lines but this does seem like a good product to help with future wrinkles/lines.
Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream.
"Good product, I put the amount I need in my palms and rub them together and push into my face instead of rubbing it in. I learned this procedure when having a make over at one of the leading department stores."
I really like this night cream because it is really moisturizing and doesn't leave my face feeling like it needs more like some creams do. That said I don't see the need for both day and night cream so I will be replacing my Olay Complete with the Aveeno absolutely ageless daily moisturizer. It is more expensive than other facial moisturizers but I did find a sale on it that made it more affordable.
I don't like wearing anything on my face because it always makes me sweat and it just feels heavy and thick but this product I absolutely loved because it was light and I couldn't feel that it was on my face when I put it on. I will definitely purchase this item.
Normally anything in the Aveeno line is out of my price range but this is one worth paying the little extra for. I live in the mountains ( and work outside) so my face goes through a lot. This night cream is just divine! I also have oily/combo skin but when I put this on my face it is silky and gives my face the moisture it so desperately needs. Would recommend this to everyone.
I have tried numerous restorative night creams with no visible results. Since receiving my last Walmart Beauty Box I have continued using only Aveeno skin products. I notice the difference in
my skin texture and am very pleased. I will continue to use the Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Restorative night cream from now on as long as it keeps working why would I change it? I have told my sisters and friends about it and they have thanked me for it. Thank-you so much for introducing me to this wonderful product!
"The Aveeno Absolutely Ageless night cream was a very nice sized sample. I was able to get five uses from it, so had the chance to give it a good try. Nice creamy texture, non-sticky. My skin felt moisturized the next morning. Would buy the full sized product."
"May be this was a product not meant for my age group (early 40s). This cream made my skin itch. It did not do much in terms of softness,. It did not absorb well. It stayed on my skin as a sticky layer and after a short while started to itch. This might be a bias review. However I would not be interested in purchasing this product."
"I was very surprised that this did not bother my fair, somewhat sensitive skin. I researched it after receiving it and it is rated quite highly. It did not burn my eyes or cause any irritation. For me, this product worked really well and did not cause any breakouts."
Oh this night cream has been very nice. A little goes a long way. Put it on your fingers and rub it in and gives you a nice coverage of your face and neck. I have very oily skin with certain products and this isn't one of them. I love not having to worry if my skin is going to be oily the next morning. Nice feeling cream and no bad smell.
"My skin was softer after using, I have very dry skin and it took away the tightness feeling. I wish it was more thick i felt it was a little watery I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.”"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.” I absolutely love the Restorative Night Cream. I woke up with less lines and wrinkles everyday and it was so easy to do. I was so glad it didn't feel oily either."
"I think this is a good product. It made my skin soft & good smelling. I really enjoyed the scent of this product. It didn't have that ovely powerful scent like some products do. It is a product I will use again. It “I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.”"

After using this product for one night I saw the difference in my skin. After using this product for a couple of weeks, I can't believe how much softer my skin is and I love the smell of this product and it only takes a few seconds a night to apply."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a sample of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ restorative night cream to review.” During the winter my skin tends to dry out so I was excited to try this night cream. It goes on really smooth and leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. I love the smell also. I trust Aveeno products and I will be using this as part of my night time routine."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless�� Restorative Night Cream to review.” I have been using this nightly and love the way it is moisturizing my skin. Feels so soft and smooth. I will be purchasing the Aveeno products they make your face feel noticeably better."
"I am always on the lookout for a good night cream. I believe I found one in Aveeno restorative night cream. This is a rich moisturizer that works wonders when combined with intensive renewal serum. I have been using both 2× daily and have noticed firmer, smoother and hydrated skin. My fine lines look less noticable, especially around my eyes. I recieved my sample from crowdtap as a member of Aveeno rewards crowd."
"Love, Love, Love this new AVEENO product. At bedtime but a little of this AVEENO Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream on and wake up in the morning feeling and looking better. It goes on smoothly and is not greasy while providing moisturizing benefits overnight. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.”"
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.” Love it! Stays on all night and smells like a dream! Nice and thick--just what I want in a night cream."
I have been using Aveeno absolutely ageless intensive renewal serum every night for a little over a week now and I can tell a difference in my skin. Easy to sleep with it on as it is light and non greasy feeling. I would recommend. Thank you Crowdtap for my free sample. #sponsored.
"I love this light lotion that absorbs easily and compliments the other products I already use. I put it on just before applying my makeup. It targets the fine lines and dullness that I battle now that I am in my 40s. I highly recommend this and other Aveeno products!I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review"
This is an easy and great product to use. I applied to a clean face at night. My face felt smooth and soft after 2 weeks. .i like the scent and the way it goes on not greasy .. My lines look a bit more small than before. I am a crowdtap member and used the as a sample to try and do my review of my own opinion Aveeno Advocates crowd
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.” I was very happy with the way it felt going on my skin. The smell was pleasant, not overwhelming."
I'm a member of Crowdtap Aveeno rewards program and Aveeno sent me a sample of its Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream to review. This product has a fresh scent that quickly absorbs into my skin. It is just the right thickness. Other night moisturizers are so thick that it takes a long time to absorb. I also like that I don't wake up with a greasy face.
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.” But my opinions are my own. Aveeno Restorative night cream made my face feel so nice. It only has a very light scent. Goes on smooth. I felt really good knowing I was improving my skin while I slept. In the morning my face felt very nice. I only received a small sample. So I can't wait to see how good my skin feels after I buy a full size bottle."
"I love the new Aveeno Night Cream, it is now one of my favorites. It goes on great and feels so soft. After one week my skin is feeling so much healthier. I love the blackberry scent.

I received this product free for an honest review. This night cream is wonderful. The only downside was the intensity of the fragrance. It does fade but very strong at first. Great for even sensitive skin. Very rich and smoothes on nicely. You wake with hydrated skin that feels vey soft. It softens fine lines very nicely. I do recommend this product.

This is my go to I love the texture n they way it feels after it's on
Aveno is an amazing cream and exactly what the description says
Great product for sensitive skin. This product does not make me break out.
"Applied at night before bed, woke up in the middle of the night to burning, itching feeling, could not stand it. Welts under the eyes."
I could not stop touching my face it was so smooth. And stayed smooth longer then does with other products I have used.
I applied it to my neck area also and noticed a much firmer appearance. It smells great! It does not feel greasy and absorbs very well!
I've used Aveeno before but not this particular night cream. I loved how it felt; lightweight and smooth. Will definitely be purchasing this!
"My face always looked very dull, but thanks to this Aveeno absolutely ageless overnight cream. my face is glowing with hydration. I have been using it everynight know for the past week. And diffenetley buying myself the biggest bottle they have."
I love this stuff. I use a lot of Aveno products but never for before bed. I like the fact that it is thick and goes on evenly. I have used a lot of thinner creams that dont seem to work. Highly recommend. #walmartcontest
I received a sample of this night cream in my Winter Classic Beauty Box sample. I found this night cream to be somewhat irritating and drying to my sensitive skin. This might be great for someone else. It was not the product for me.
I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful with what I use. I don't know why but Aveeno seems to bother me if I use it on my face. I do like to use it on the dry skin of my upper arms. It works great there. #WalmartContest
"I have only used this for two days now, and I must submit another review after the tube is finished. But ... so far so good. I am impressed with the amount you use. You barely have to put any on, a small amount covers your face well enough."
I received this product in my Walmart Beauty Box and I love it! I gave it 2 weeks of use to see if I noticed a difference in my skin and I can tell you my face is glowing and soft. I would definitely recommend this product. #walmartcontest
I love Aveeno products because they work! They are natural and no perfume to irritate your skin . I got this sample and I was excited to try it's been a week and it does wonders for my skin helps to feel rejuvenated and moisturized #walmartcontest
"This cream makes my skin so soft! I love it! I have been searching for something that makes my skin feel soft and smooth, and I found it! I got a sample in my Walmart Beaty Box and I am sold!"
Still early to tell the full benefits but it is a nice cream and feel great on my face at night. When I wash my face in the morning it still feels smooth.
I LOVE this cream! It smells yummy and makes my face feel soft and moisturized. I have been an Olay Total Effects ONLY user for years but I will be adding this to my regimen for a night time cream.
"I use this every night before bed and my face feels silky smooth in the morning. It's lightweight, gentle, and doesn't leave a greasy feeling. Doesn't clog pores either which is a huge plus in my book."
I thought it was really good stuff. It is like a moisturizer and feels good when you put it on. It will not break your skin out. I have sensitive skin and I did not break out. I used it twice. I did not use the product over a long term.
Restorative night cream. I have used other Aveeno products but this one works reallly well. It absorbs quickly and has a pleasant fragrance. Some of the soy producdts have a funny scent. I am 54 and it makes the skin on my neck look smoooth.
I love this product. A little goes a long way. I intend to purchase it after my samples runs out and make it a regular part of my night time product line. Thank you Aveeo for such a great night time cream.
"I love all things Aveeno, but had never tried the night cream. I really like this product and will definitely buy it. Good for dry skin, not greasy and very fresh feeling."
I have used this cream for about two weeks now. My skin appears smoother and definitely has a healthy glow to it. My skin is prone to breakouts and happy to write that this product has not caused any breakouts.
"This cream absorbs into the skin quickly, smells heavenly, and hopefully will slow down the aging process. I would recommend it and will purchase it in the future. I love Aveeno products."
"I liked the light feel and scent. I like when a moisturizer feels like it soaks it and doesn't stay on top of my skin. I use Estée Lauder, but would consider this a good and more affordable alternative."
"I live in the Michigan Upper Peninsula, and winters here are harsh on my skin. Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream worked miracles on my skin this winter! I love it!"
I tried this every night since receiving and I didn't really see a significant improvement in my skin. I will use it until it's gone but I don't see how it's any different from the regular face lotion I've been using on my face at night.
I have very dry and very sensitive skin & this product worked great! I woke up in the morning and my face still felt moisturized & so soft. I didn't experience any burning & for once when I woke up in the morning my skin wasn't dry & flaky.
The Aveeno cream is not greasy and leaves your skin soft as it absorbs into your skin. Most are real bad for leaving a film on your skin and this did not.
This product is rather light compared to other night creams I have tried. It absorbs quickly and applies easily. I didn't notice a huge difference in my skin though
"Thank you for including this product in my gift box. It keeps my skin so moisturized and soft. I'm buying this from now on. It's not irritating at all. In fact, it makes my skin glow."
I tried this product for the first time and I absolutely love it. I have tried many face products but this is the best one that works for me. Its a bit pricey but worth it.
"This night cream seems to make my skin softer, but I'm not sure it made me look younger. It absorbs easily and is not greasy. It has a nice smell, but is a little bit strong. I will buy again."
"This is the first time that I have used a night cream. After my sample ran out, I immediately ran to Walmart to buy the full size item. I can't see myself not using a night cream ever again!"
This cream is not heavy or greasy like some night creams. My skin soaked it right up and felt great the next morning. Pleasant smell and nice light texture
I really liked how Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream made my face moist and non-greasy. It didn't irritate my skin. I will definitely try it!
I applied the night cream at night it went on smooth and the next morning my face still felt smooth all day. Very pleased with this product to use a t night. It's a winner for me at night.
Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream went on very smooth and felt smooth and refreshing on my face. I believe with continued used you will feel and look a lot younger.
Aveeno has gentle and effective beauty products and this one did not disappoint. It goes on light and smooth and works beautifully while you sleep. I love it and plan to purchase the full size when this is done.
This product made a real difference in the texture of my skin on my face. I like to moisturize my skin good before I go to bed and this product makes all the difference in the world! Love it.
Great product for preventative aging. I love it. This is the second sample of this I've received and I really enjoy it! It goes on nicely and absorbs well and it leaves your skin soft. It didn't mess with my sensitive skin which I love.
I used this several night and it is easy to apply. nongreasy and made my skin texture feel better. I usead all of the product and it worked okay. I did notice my skin didnt look as tired.
I like how soft my face feels after putting this cream on at night. I'm even more impressed that when I wash my face in the morning it's still hydrated and soft feeling. I was looking for a night time face cream and this one is very good.
I've never used a night cream but this one has been great. I love that it is thicker and I feel like I get a fuller coverage and it really does a number for my skin
I had never tried this and I love it! I have been buying it ever since trying it! It is so smooth and feels wonderful! It is not greasy and doesn't clog your pores. I would recommend this product.
"I used this product at night and it did a good job of leaving my skin feeling smoother. If the fragrance were not s0 unappealing, I would purchase it."
"Got a small sample size of this in my Walmart Beauty Box, Spring 2016. I had never used the product before in the past. It smells fabulous and it leaves your face feeling so fresh after use. Definitely a product I would buy."
This made my skin feel so good! I also saw that the redness of my skin was reduced. I looked for this product at my local Wal-Mart and couldn't find it. I did however find d it on line.
"The cream went on smooth, was not greasy or sticky. The odor was pleasant and not overpowering."
Will definitely try for long term improvement. Thanks
I was kind of skeptacle to try Aveeno overnight cream because I have sensitive skin but I tried it my face felt so soft the first time using it. I recommend it. Great smell.
"I am 59 young, with life long oily, red prone, sensitive skin.I always worry about clogged pores when trying new skin care products. So far, this cream has not disappointed and the smell is relaxing and fresh."
"I am unable to use creams on my face at night so I apply it right before I go work. I have been using it daily for about 10 days, my face feels smoother and looks brighter."
"I loved the way it felt on my face, silky and smooth. I noticed my face looked brighter and softer after about a week. That convinced me to purchase once my sample was gone. I've been using this product for about two months and love it!"
The night cream really has improved the look of my skin. I can see an improvement in the appearance of my skin overall and my lines seem less noticeable.I like he way it absorbs and doesn't leave my skin with a greasy film.
"This is a good product. i like how ti feels on my skin, not too heavy but enough to know its on."
I will purchase this after I use the sample.. good product.
I enjoyed the sample size of this product! Nice to try before buying the full size. My skin still felt moisturized in the morning after waking up. That is the true test of a nighttime moisturizer for me!
Aveeno Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream goes on light and smooth and leaves your face feeling nourished. I can acutually feel my skin drinking in the moisture.
I love the way this cream makes my skin feel at night. It is not heavy or greasy. Has a lavender scent which is calming at night and calming for my skin's redness.
I really liked how gentle this was on my skin which is very sensitive and I have rosacea. I have tried other night creams that have just been too harsh on my face. But after using the Aveeno for a week my skin felt softer and looked less dull.
"I put this on before going to bed and woke up to soft, beautiful, non greasy skin. No greasy or oily residue left on my pillow. Hydrated my skin with feeling oily."
This product felt very nice on my skin and I enjoyed using it. I did not see any fantastic results but I suppose one may after giving it some more time.
Love this cream made my skin feel really nice l have sensitive skin and it really helped with my discoloration . I will defiantly need to buy a full size in this one.❤️
"Im a 58 year old female, fair complected and spent many years sun bathing, this product not only aids in putting moisture back into my skin, it helps lessen the over all appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. will be getting this again"
I like this cream it does leave your skin feeling soft and not greasy or oily but I don't see any difference in wrinkles or fine lines. good moisturizer but not a wrinkle/fine line reducer that I can see.
I am very impressed with this night cream. I like the fact that it is not greasy and blends in quickly. I use this nightly and it has made my face smooth and I look younger.
My face is glowing and is doesn't have patches of dry skin now that I use this. Shared this information with my friends and when they have seen me they agree with the glow I have.
"This was another nice product from Aveeno. Not only did this not irritate my skin, but I woke up with soft, smooth skin. I think I have found a new moisturizer team for my face."
I love this product. I use the day cream and night cream every single day. It is amazing. I cannot say how great. I have sensitive skin and am seeing the very beginning of aging on my skin and this product is working wonderfully.
"Thick & creamy, but able to soak in 100% in a short period of time. The scent is amazing & definitely makes a difference with fine lines around my eyes."
"I normally can't use a night cream when I do, I usually wake up with clogged pores. This product doesn't break me out at all. In the morning, my skin looks great."
This is a good night cream to use. I think in time it will make a difference in the appearance of my skin. I like the feel of it on my skin and how quickly in absorbs into my skin without leaving a sticky residue.
I like Aveeno products because they never leave your skin feeling greasy or looking shiny. This is a good nighttime cream. Leaves your skin soft. Not heavy & a little goes a long way.
"I WOULD SO LOVE TO GET THIS in my beauty box... I have loved every night cream, face cream, day cream, I have ever received in the box....I love anything Aveeno, and always use a night cream... I'd love it..."
"I felt that it hydrates my skin, but is not strong enough for a 60 years old like me. However, is ok as an everyday cream, not for the night.. Therefore I gave 3 stars."
Received a sample from Crowdtap for my honest review!! I like this product as a nighttime moisturizer. It goes on smooth and is easily absorbed!! My skin felt soft and smooth when I woke up!!
"This is good for younger skin. That don't have deep wrinkles. I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a sample of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Intensive Renewal Serum to review.”"
I'm a member of the crowdtap aveeno rewards program and aveeno sent me a sample of aveeno absolutely ageless restorative night cream to review and I love it. My face feels soft and smooth and fine lines and wrinkles have softened.
"Aveeno absolutely ageless restorative night cream is awesome. After cleaning my face and using the cream, I went to sleep. Woke up eight hours later to healthy well moisturized skin. I looked awesome even without makeup!"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review."

I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review."
"I've never tried this product until I received it in my beauty sample box. I was truly surprised how creamy and easy to apply. The scent was amazing. My skin was still moisturizer when I woke up the following day and not dry as usual. Please give this a try and aveeno, I will be buying this as soon as my sample, which was generous), runs out."
"Made my skin soft and hydrated. I am going through a lot of different climates and it definitely is helping. I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.”"
"I found this product good for sensitive skin. It absorbs quickly into the skin. But I thought for it being a ""cream"" it would be thicker than being the consistency of a lotion. Now I got the trial from the Walmart Beauty Box (which I highly subscribe) spring edition, so I've only got to use it about 4 times so far. So to be fair I can say I think it is decent. Kind of pricey tho."
I received this night cream from aveeno and Crowdtap to try for my opinion and it is the best night cream ever! It is thick and creamy with a fresh scent. It hydrates all through the night so my skin feels fresh and alive when i wake up. Definitely worth a try!
"This night cream was wonderful. My skin feels so soft. It absorbed quickly and smells awesome. I woke up looking refreshed! I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review."

"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.” When I wake in the mornings my skin looks great! My face has a lot of hydration. My face feels firmer. Love the smell! I will replace my other night cream with this one. This does not break my skin out which is a big plus for me!"
"I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review. With that being said I love this product! I have sensitive skin and have had no problems with this. I apply nightly and wake up to a soft, smooth, hydrated complexion. I use in conjunction with the other products in the Aveeno Absolutely Ageless line and have notice fine lines and wrinkles have diminshed. Gratis product, I highly recommend."
"“I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.” I went to bed feeling confident that I have taken care of my face the best I could for the day."

I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO rewards program and AVEENO sent me a sample of its AVEENO Absolutely Ageless Restorative Night Cream to review. I thought it was a great product. The night cream was a Rick thick cream. I want that type of cream for the night so that my skin is soft and supple and ready to go the next morning.
"I really loved this night cream! It went on smoothly and didn't make my skin feel greasy at all. My skin felt the next morning as well. “I'm a member of the Crowdtap AVEENO® rewards program, and AVEENO® sent me a samples of its AVEENO® Absolutely Ageless™ Restorative Night Cream to review.”"
