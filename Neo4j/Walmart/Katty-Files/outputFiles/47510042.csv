I have used only Ponds cold cream to clean my face for 57 years. I tried the Rejuveness as soon as I saw it in store. I love it. Makes my skin feel soft and it lessens look of fine wrinkles I am beginning to have. I am 70 but people always take me for 50. I thank 57 years of using Ponds. Now I use your towelettes after the cold cream and the Rejuveness. That is all that goes on my face. It is all I need! Thank you for great products.
"The Ponds Anti Wrinkle cream was pretty good.I liked tge fact that it didnt irritate around my eye area.It was very smooth, non greasy and had my skin looking great.I received complimentary , tthis is my unbiased review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm a member of Influenster. This product was sent to me for testing purposes and all opinions are my own. This is the first time that I tried Pond's Rejuveness. Not only did I like the smell but I noticed a difference the very first time I used it. I'm glad that I got a chance to try it cause I know I will be buying this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I completed the 2 week challenge and loved the results. I used this morning and night and was able to see results within 2 weeks. I was skeptical at first but the results made me a believer. I was even able to reduce the ""11"" between my eyebrows. I obtained my product for free through Influenster and took the challenge. My own personal opinion is that this is a great product. Definitely will be buying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I needed a change from my normal routine..in just art in a facial moisturizer regimen. I remember my aunt swear by PONDS product for years. Since I'm 39...woooweee!! been awhile since I admit my age since most people don't believe my age. One week In and I can feel the difference. Never to early to start taking care of your skin.
"Love this product. I was hesitant to do the two-week challenge but decided to see what this product would do. Yes I really love this. Absorbs well when applied lightly. This smoothed my skin. I don't have any wrinkles, maybe fine lines under my eyes but even I wouldn't call it that. I noticed how evened out my skin was. Didn't look dull but fresh. This has a nice light scent. Texture is smooth and light. A nice light layer is good for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"ivd been using this for four months now and my fine lines are gone. i use this at night and let it soak in, then apply the dark correcting cream. my fine lines are not noticeable and my skin tone is even."
Love the way it makes your skin feel...my face is smoother...less noticeable wrinkles...decided to try on my hands...they look younger...wish they made a body lotion...not a bad look for 62 (me) and 65 (sister)
I bought this product hoping to look a few years younger. First time buyer last time buyer. Is it absolutely nothing I've been using it for a month two times a day. I was very disappointed in this product.
I use this product because my face look healthy. And feel very good using ponds. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a wonderful product, leaves skins soft & smooth! & smells good too! Really helps those fine lines."
I have been using Rejuveness Anti-Wrinkle Cream for about a week now and I can see the difference already. I am a senior on a fixed income and I want to thank you for making such a great product at such an affordable price. I am attaching some photos of my Grandmother's old Ponds jar from 1910 that my Mother gave to me. Honestly I didn't know that Ponds was still in business until my niece told me.
"I started using the Pond's Rejuveness moisturizer about two weeks ago and I can honestly say the results are impressive. I pull in my eyes a lot so they are starting to look wrinkly. After the first two weeks of use, I've noticed a fullness in that area or should I say it looks filled. This is something I will definitely buy again. This also has a pleasant scent unlike most drug store moisturizers. I got this free to try from Influenster and def recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
getting over 50 I realize I need an anti wrinkle formula. Again I am satisfied with POND'S product.
"If you have sensitive skin you might want to avoid this product. I wanted something for my dry skin after entering menopause and decided to try this as it was reasonably priced. Can't use it. My face is now tight, swollen, red and itchy. I everywhere it is red it also feel hot. Tried to wash it off but it absorbed right into my skin and I will just have to wait for my body to get rid of the toxin on its own."
I have taken the 2 week Rejuveness challenge and I'm impressed. The scent is amazing compared to some other anti-wrinkle creams I've used in the past. After the 2 week challenge I can see a faint difference in the forehead wrinkles and I will continue to use the product. I received this item complementary To use and review.

"POND'S Rejuveness ANTI-AGING CREAM have an esplendid fragances, as baby powder. It is a light cream that absorbs quickly. It's not feel greasy or sricky. After several days, I noticed that my face looks brighter, younger and smoother. I do not have wrinkles and I think this cream will take a long time to leave. The use twice a day as part of daily beauty routine. Definitely, I will buy. I received this sample from Pinchme free for testing purposes but all opinion are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product via Influenster and I loved the combo of this and theB3 dark spot remover. I used as directed & noticed how smootth& soft my skin became just after the second day. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This smells. So much so that my husband made me go wash this cream off. The scent is so overwhelmingly grandma, I dont understand why they dont update this formula to either remove it or take it down a notch. For that reason, this gets a huge one star."
"I am 62 and the signs of aging are show, especially in my neck. I have tried many products from over the counter to expensive creams. The only difference I noticed is soft ""wrinkly"" skin. I saw Ponds Rejuveness Anti-Wrinkle Cream and gave it a try, well to my amazement, this product worked BETTER than any other lotions is ever tried. It is a must try for anyone in need. LOVE IT."
ive started using this product recently and i just bought it because my usual moisturizer wasnt in stock. its a good moisturizer but it could definitely be more moisturizing. i dont think i would buy this specific one again but i know their blue one like this is very good.
I use this everyday. My face gets dry from time to time and this lotion does the job for me. It was recommended to me and I would recommend to another.
I didnt see anything difference to the skin but it feels really nice on the skin especially under the eyes. It didnt break me out and had a good formula. I would buy this again to see if it lives up to its claims.
Gave this to my mom. She loved the fact that it was nice and moisturizing. She even has backup. Don't think she sees a big difference on reducing wrinkles. But nice product overall. Would recommend to others too. Will buy again soon cause it runs out fast.
"What a great moisturizer and anti-aging cream! It keeps me looking young and doesn't cause me to itch! It's thick, so it doesn't feel greasy. It has some of the same properties as La Mere and it's a fraction of the price! Don't wait, try this now and get the moisture and anti wrinkle cream you need!"
Fantastic daily moisturizer. Isnt heavy or greasy feeling and is gentle around the eyes. I use this at night and before applying my makeup. If you want that dewy feel that some moisturizers give then this one may disappoint. Ive found that if I really want that feeling or if my face is feeling a little more dry than normal I have to use quite a bit to achieve it.
I do not use this for wrinkle purposes but instead for the lovely scent . This was a gift. See no difference but I use this simply to moisturize my face.
"I love this cream. The texture is incredibile, leave your skin soft and relaxed. You use it before the bed and keep my face moisturizer all night long."
I do like this ponds cream but I do like the dry skin formula a lot better. This was my first time using this formula in the brand. I do like the packaging I do think it is nice. I would recommend this to others.
Okay for short term but does not pack the punch which I need. Does not have lasting effects. I added coconut oil and it was much better but this will get you through.
I read that this was a dupe for la mer and while Im not quite sure thats accurate this stuff is pretty good. Ive been putting it on at night and my skin feels soft and fresh in the morning. Need longer to see if it actually helps with aging
"I love this moisturizer especially for the night time. Ive used this for the past 4 months and absolutely love it. It makes my skin look and feel great. Works miracles, I really recommend you look into purchasing this!"
"This product is a must have for me. I use it twice a day, once in the morning and again at night. I noticed after using it for about 2 weeks that it helped with my wrinkles, including on my neck area."
"I purchased this on a chance that it would work. I was stunned. This is an amazing product at an amazing price. I'm 68 and recently lost 50 lbs. The skin on my face has been a bit saggy since. With the help of this product, I've put the facelift on hold. I hope Ponds never stops producing this line. It's fabulous!!"
"I have tried so many expensive brands of specialty facial creams on my very sensitive, over-50 skin, but Rejuveness did the trick. I have been using it exclusively for over 6 months and I will not switch. My skin keeps well hydrated, looks younger with fewer wrinkles, and the softness can't be beat. It has really helped to protect my skin during this very cold winter and all without blocking up my pores. Thank you, Unilever, for creating an effective and affordable facial skin care product!"
"I took the #seeforyourself 2 week challenge and the results are really noticeable! My skin is soft and well moisturized, decrease in fine lines and it didn't clog my pores or give me acne. It absorbs fully and doesn't feel like a film on your skin. I really like it! I tested the POND'S products for free, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My aunt always told me about Ponds, I remember I was around 14 when she told me that she kept young by just using ponds moisturizer; she swore by it. When I turned 20, I started using ponds, guess what? I swear by it too! This stuff works! I highly recommended it, it's a great product and very affordable."
"As with all Ponds products, this one fails miserably because of the heavy perfume scent, which not only does not appeal to many noses but also causes many people's skin to react poorly. Sure wish Ponds would make unscented products some day, but I doubt they ever will."
"I needed a new moisturizer and remembered how creamy and mild Ponds was when my mom use to use it. I'm 44 and have noticed my skin thinning. I've been using this for 2 weeks now and have noticeably brighter, smoother and plumper skin. I have also been using on my neck and heels and have been amazed at what this product is doing! I have used every outrageously anti-aging product available and this has been the best I've tried! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product worked with my skin. I have very sensitive skin (The reason I use Pond's in the first place) I was reluctant to buy but the store I was in was out of traditional Pond's Moisturizer. I thought what the heck, I am so glad I bought this. I do have to wait the 25 minutes after cleansing before I put it on but I'm happy to do it."
"I tried Rejuveness for the fine lines/""crows feet"" I've developed around my eyes and also the frown lines across my forehead. The high concentration of lactic acid proved to be too strong for my skin, causing it to become red and irritated. Also, the scent seems a bit overpowering. However, rather than toss the trial size that I had purchased, I used it on my rough feet and it was GREAT for my heels."
"I am a migraine sufferer, although I've been using ponds moisturizer all my life, I bought this because I trusted it to be the same very light smell which I'm used to. I just got it in the mail last night. I was so eager to use it. I put it on and the smell was overwhelming. Not only did I get a migraine right away but I couldn't sleep alright from the perfume smell. It's now morning and I still smell it. Will not be using it a second time. Waist of money for me."
"I've been using this product for a couple of years and wouldn't be without it. Matter-of--fact, the women in my family do 'a favorite thing' every Christmas and this product was mine to give. And now they wouldn't be without it. It's non greasy and can easily be worn under your foundations."
"I'm still in my early twenties, but I figured if I want to keep looking youthful I should start to prevent aging when I have the skin I want to keep. Much to my surprise I saw an honest difference within a week. Who knew, right? But the product works! And it's much more affordable than most things on the market. I will definitely keep buying this."
"I have delicate dry skin but it has many fine wrinkles, as my mother's did. I was trying other expensive products and I didn't really see any improvement. On a whim I picked up the Ponds. I absolutely LOVE how this smells. It's only been a week so I can't say for sure that I have seen results but I will definitely continue using this. The scent of it is very invigorating to me and very feminine."
"Unfortunately, I was unable to do the two week challenge because of the overpowering fragrance of this product. After applying and having the product on for less than an hour each time, I had to wash my face. The fragrance gave me a headache each time I used it. I tried several different times to use the product, but each time had the same result. Perhaps Ponds could make this product without adding such a strong fragrance. Would definitely try again with a fragrance free product."
"Have used Ponds Dry Skin cream my entire life but, now as I age, I thought I should add an anti-wrinkle component to my cream. So, when I saw Rejuveness, I thought I had found the right product. The cream feels good on my skin but the scent is overwhelming! Not sure if I will continue to use this product as the fragrance is so strong. Will look for a product that is fragrance free. I am disappointed though, because I have always used Ponds products."
"POND'S Rejuveness is not only affordable, but it's hypoallergenic, so it doesn't cause breakouts. It's an easy way to prevent the signs of aging, like fine lines, wrinkles, and dryness. It's easy to find in the stores because POND'S is a solid brand. Gentle enough to use both morning and night and affordable enough to actually use twice a day. I highly recommend Rejuveness. I'm a product review blogger and I received this product in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought it today wanted a rich night cream that would work on wrinkles. I use one for the day that has Vitiman C in it to brighten. I put it on my face, hands and arms and they all looked terrific after putting it on. Fine lines were smoothed over and my skin felt soft. I will be buying this again after I use it all."
"I purchased this for the super crepeness on the back of my hands. (Nothing ages a woman like her hands) I started using Rejuveness Anti-Wrinkle Cream Thursday, today is Sunday. There is a dramatic improvement. Why, oh why did I ever wander away from Pond's products. I have tried numerous really expensive lotions and creams - no improvement. I should have taken the hundreds of dollars I wasted and threw it into the street. Ponds developed a product that not only works, but is affordable."
POND'S Rejuveness Anti Wrinkle Cream is a must have moisturizer to start preventing wrinkles. Pond's is an OG brand that even my mother and grandmother recommend it! Packaging is nice and in a compact jar. POND'S Rejuveness Anti Wrinkle Cream is super inexpensive and absolutely buying again!
I bought this to try out because I have combination skin an I have bad smile lines the only good things I. Can. Say about this when I. Put it on it did make my wrinkles fade for. A. Little bit an it smells. Good. But for. Some. Reason it would. Crumble on my face leave white balls. I. Didn't. Like that at all it wasn't moisturizing on my skin. So I was disappointed
It seemed to help. And still does help. Just need a few othere products to go with it due to my skin type is different for places on my face. Every one is different when it comes to these things. I have nothing negative to say about this brand other than it works for me.
"I love this! it helps keep away wrinkles and even acne. I love that it is inexpensive and that the second ingredient is lactic acid.... so your skin is getting what it needs to feel and look better. This cream doesn't make me feel oily and greasy, I still feel like my face can ""breathe"" and it's not stifled under a thick heavy cream. This cream absorbs rather quickly and isn't sitting on top of your skin."
It wasnt bad but it wasnt great either. It was very basic to me and I didny really enjoy it as much as the clarant B3 which is a holy grail of mine. Its still a great value regardless and I recommend if you want a good night moisturizer thats gentle and affordable.
POND'S Rejuveness Anti Wrinkle Cream Im a first time user. This Is a new addition to my skin care routine and Im LOVING it! I use it morning and night after cleansing my face. Its very gentle and has a light and clean fragrance. I have mature skin and want to reduce signs of aging and fine lines and wrinkles. I will continue using this product. Its really moisturizing and makes my makeup apply so much nicer.
"Bought this at first to go on a trip and it was small to carry, but little did I know I loved it! It leaves my skin super moisturized without making it greasy and goes on so nicely! I dont have wrinkles yet, but definitely think it firms fine lines! This is my new favorite face lotion and it is not expensive either!"
"I absolutely love this cream! Its a must in my skincare routine. I apply it after washing my face and applying toner. Its very hydrating and really locks in to moist skin. It doesnt leave an oily residue. It has a mild scent which isnt unpleasant at all to me, but that may be something for those sensitive to scents to look out for. This is my staple face and neck moisturizer."
"Although I dont have a lot of wrinkles yet I like to use this ponds anti wrinkle cream to help prevent any or slow the process for any. As soon as I put some of this cream on my face I instantly feel it working. I feel as if my face is being hugged. Its hard to explain but if you use it, you will definitely know the feeling I am talking about. It leaves my skin looking so soft and moisturized."
"I like the formula and the consistency of this cream. I think the price is good. It says results visible in two weeks but I am not seeing major results, but I do see a minimal improvement in my skin. I think maybe after a bit longer it might be more results but not as I expected it to be."
Ive been using this facecream for years. It doesn't leave my face feeling greasy and it absorbs quickly.
I think this is good and is gentle but I prefer the rejuveness anti wrinkle on the red container... works way better
this moisturizer really hydrates your skin and if you use it daily you will definitely see hw wrinkles disappear
It would have a great moisturizer for me but the scent ruins it. It's too overwhelming. Even the smallest amount of this product carries a strong smell.
Its really thick and I seen a difference on my neck. I just dont like the scent it has it lingers for a while . I bought the trial size to test it out and will be purchasing the full size when I'm done with it .
This cream leaves you with good soft skin!!! I love using this cream because after my skin is just tight and glowing!!! My mom who is 55 years old loves it and got me into wearing it and now I cant stop!!!!!
Ponds is my go to lotion. Every single bottle color is different . I really recommend reading what it says it fits any skin type. It is a little thick so a little goes a long way.
"I picked this up on a whim in a small travel size and have I been missing out! It is a little too rich for my combo skin for day use, especial over warm summer months, but I love it for evening use in my night time routine. Great price point too!"
I've used this a few times it's pretty thick on the skin. The smell is soft so that's good. Doesn't actually do much for existing wrinkles but it may be preventing them from getting deeper. It's an ok in a pinch product.
amazing. everything Ponds I recommend. this cream I put on some times after the shower if my face is super dry. also I recommend using a little bit if this in a cutip to get your eye makeup off. it works wonders.
i LOVE this product SOOOOOOO Very much!!!! I use this product ALLLL the TIME! It NEVER has let me down!!! it does the job it is supposed to!!!!!
Here my photos of my every day looks and my ponds stacked up to keep my skincare on top and make sure to use day and night! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought this and absolutely love it! I have been using it for about 1 1/2 weeks and I can see the difference. I would recommend to anyone!! Thank you Ponds!!!!
I USED POND'S FACE CREAM FOR YEARS. I AM GLAD IT IS BACK. I AM USING BOTH OF THESE CREAMS AND I LOVE THEM. THEY MAKE MY FACE FEEL LIKEIT WAS BATHED IN WATER IT IS THAT HYDRATED. THANK YOU POND'S FOR COMING BACK.
I used once and Loved it the feel of it but not the smell. I do not understand why so many products add fragrance to their products. This smells like something my grandmother would wear. Would be a customer for life if it were fragrance free.
I am sorry to say that I cannot use this product because of the overwhelming smell. I therefore cannot say whether it is good for my skin or not. I love Ponds Cold Cream.
Purchased product on recommendation of a neighbor whose skin looks wonderful. I have issues with the strong perfume smell which gives me a headache. There is also a slight burning sensation after applying.
"Great product but I wish they also made it fragrance free. I have sensitive skin, Ponds pls also make the exact same cream but fragrance free, otherwise can't Continue to use."
Ponds has been around forever and is just as wonderful now as years ago! I LOVE Clarant! It is wonderful and works great! Been using it for 1 week and really notice the difference in brown spots on each cheek. Thank you Ponds!
"I have extremely sensitive and dry skin and this product works miracles on my skin. It leaves my face feeling baby soft, and soothed. Its become part of my skincare routine and I recommended it to everyone that I know!"
I keep it at home and have a travel size one. I use it at night before going to bed and in the morning before leaving for work. This and the cold cream are my go tos.
This product is an amazing price. However for me I did not find it particularly moisturizing not did I find it to make any difference on wrinkles. The scent is light and the texture is creamy but it is not something I would purchase again.
"Works great. Keeps my face moisturized, while protecting me from fine lines and wrinkles. You are never not old enough to worry about skincare. The earlier, the better. I would recommend to anyone to try!"
"My mom bought this, I tried it and it texture is creamy plus it smells good. I didn't keep on using, but til this day my mom uses it and I have seen that it does help."
This cream of ponds is wonderful in the night you apply it on the face and neck and it helps you to prevent wrinkles and spots clear up a lot is terrific it does not leave the sticky skin is great
"I use this product every night. For the most part I love it but the only bad part is the smell. It just reminds me of my grandma. But other than the smell, I love how fresh my skin looks the next day!"
Love it! It leaves my skin soft and smooth as well as helps with my dry skin. The container it comes in is super cute and easy to take along wherever you go. This is a great product that I will continue to buy and I highly recommend it to everyone.
I love this product. Its cheap and easy to find. Its absorbs so well into the skin and feels very hydrating! Im not sure if it helps with wrinkles but everyone guesses me as much younger than I am!
"this product is great for dry skin, but if your skin is acne prone this is not your moisturizer as I tend to break out more often when using this formula"
I would highly recommend this. I've noticed a big change in my skin since I started using it. Very gentle on the skin and more effective than anything else I've tried. It's also very affordable.
"This is so moisturizing without being oily! My grandma swears by this stuff and was the only one she used, it keeps her skin looking 20 years younger and shes 89! I had to trust it and try it, now I love it."
wrinkles. Started using Pondd in my younger years. My grandmother used it . Every night after Washington g my face with noxema . I have no wrinkles. And I'm 51. My grandmother was 83 and never looked her age.
"My mom has always used this brand for her makeup removal. As I got older, I started to as well. It goes on very smooth. And leaves skin very soft. The reason I couldnt give it 5 stars is because it does seem to leave a greasy feeling on my face. Maybe its just me. But I do Love the product"
"So far, I like this product. It has a nice smell, and a very thick consistency, so my face feels nice and moisturized. I am not sure if it is helping my wrinkles or not because I use several creams, but so far I like this product and would buy it again."
Hello. i love all product of this company if you allow me to review this product I would grateful to you. I can help you promote your product by reviewing them in my photo for the purpose of people to buy from internet and on encouraging the same time help the company promote good news. Best Regards
"This product, in itself here is well known and quoted, is mostly used as a make-up remover, however it applied its function, which helped me to clear my skin, since it had sunburned and stained my skin, it helped me to recover and also maintain a thinner skin; I would add clean, soft, refreshing, without forgetting very well treated."
"This product does work. It helps with wrinkles and hydrated the skin without feeling heavy or greasy. I find the scent of this product to be good but overwhelming, like the other products within this brand. I don't have issues with breakouts or anything when I use this and my skin can be sensitive. I like the price of this product and will buy again when on a tight budget."
This wrinkle cream is good for the price I can't say whether or not it helped with fine lines or wrinkles. It is very moisturizing but doesn't leave my face feeling greasy. It is very gentle even for me who has pretty sensitive skin. I would recommend this product.
Nice sent and consistency for a nightly moisturizing treatment. Did not meet the expectation I thought it would have. Really affordable for the quantity. I purchased the travel size wich is for 2 weeks. I would recommend it but not for the wrinkle treatment
"I have used this moisturizer while traveling because it comes in cute little bottles. It worked really well and kept my face feeling hydrated, but not greasy. It was pretty cheap for the travel size and lasted a good amount of time. I didn't see any major change in fine lines or wrinkles, but I would purchase this again."
This product is very affordable and a little goes a long way. I got the trial size and I have had it for over two months now and I'm about half way done with it. It leaves my skin feeling nice and plump. I will be repurchasing this product when I run out.
Im only 26 so I don't have much wrinkles or lines to worry about but I do use this a few times every couple of weeks. It does give a moisturized feel and I notice the scent last a decent time through out the day. It's better to start with great skin care routine while young and not waiting for too long when it's too late. I would recommend it to anyone wanting to avoid or to help moisturize dry wrinkled skin
"I ran out of my regular moisturizer and picked up a Pond's trial size! I am so glad that I did! This moisturizer has been a great find for my dry winter skin! Pond's was always my granny's ""cure-all"" cream for dry, itchy skin. We always laughed at her, but now I know she was right!"
Best product!! I was considering a professional chemical peel for my forehead and neck. I am 45 with sun damage 2 deep wrinkles on my forehead and my neck has 2 deep wrinkles and is sagging. It took about a month but my deep wrinkles are lines now and my neck has tighten amazing.
"I am really happy with this product. I have sensitive skin and this product doesn't make my face break out or leave it red and blotchy like some other products have before. The price point is excellent! I get a quality product without having to spend a fortune. I also have very dry skin and with Rejuveness my face feels soft all day. The only downside is that it doesn't have an SPF in the product. If that were combined, then this would be the ultimate face moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Use this product and friends tell me I look 10 years younger and im 41. It nourishes and keeps face looking younger.
"Nice results, very cost-effective , but not a huge fan of the scent. Wish it smelled better .I use it on my body, not my face."
Soft in your skin and easy to use. It doesn't clog my pores and has a soft baby skin after prodyct feels which is good for me.
One of my favorite face creams. The smell is so good. It's very inexpensive and keeps my face moisturized. I would recommend this cream.
"This is my nightly routine cream. I use it every night. It keeps my skin moisture and prevent wrinkles. Texture is,really creamy. It just blends in."
My mom has used this for a while now and she is extremely satisfied with the product. It starts showing results in around two weeks.
I used this as a night cream for 6 weeks straight I am so impressed my face looks more lifted and brights
I love this product I been using this product since I was 10 years old I love the smell the way it makes my skin smooth
This is a great product for someone for sensitive skin like me. It's very mild and leaves your face soft and smooth without the oily feel.
"It is an excellent product; moisturizes the skin and helps correct imperfections, is refreshing and smells delicious"
"It helps in forming the skin and visibly reduces the appearance of fine lines . It is dermatologically tested , hypoallergenic and won't clog pores ."
Love this product.. a little goes a long way. Doesn't leave your skin oily. Keeps my face moisturized all day which is awesome.
"Evidenced by combination skin out, but did Mitt notice any wrinkle reduction. I received this from someone. I don't know the cost. The packaging was simple."
This is good for people who are aging. You have to use this for 2mths to see result. But this said 2wks you should see a different. The texture is thick but smooth when you rub in.
I have very sensitive skin and this product is amazing. It also seems to have reactivated my Botox. My dermatologist asked if I had had Botox done from my last visit. After seeing my skin my co-workers have all started using it
"Imagree with a lot of the other reviews. I have no idea what this product will do to remove wrinkles after only two days, but I cannot stand the odor!"
"This eye cream definitely plumps any sagging or wrinkles on the eyes. I don't use it religiously but when I feel like I need a pick me up, this cream gets the job done!"
I have dry skin and I use this and it seriously feels so rich and moisturizing. I switched to this because my last moisturizer just wasn't working for me anymore & I seriously love this one!
"I love how thick this product is, but at the same time how well it absorbs into the skin. A little goes a long way, so I love the small trial sized packagings. The smell is very light and pleasant. I have been using this product for several years."
"so love this brand and this product so much! It's gentle on my skin, which is very sensitive. This product is also very affordable, which is great for college students like me!!"
I love this cream. It really works and since it is such a large jar I can use as much as I want. I would recommend this to anyone. It works better than the $!00.00 cream I usually use.
I use this religiously and my face has never felt more soft. You put it on after washing your face and it leaves a tingly feeling. I'm almost out but I'll definitely be buying more. It's the only product that doesn't break me out.
"I use this at night, not sure if it is helping with wrinkles but it has helped from the cold blistering air we've had. My face was drying out and it helped to bring back moisture to my face with out and oily residue"
This cream works magic. I love love how my face feels after applying. This is a all year round cream hot or cold and it helps decrease wrinkles.. So worth the price.
I usually love ponds. The cold cream is life for removing makeup and washing your face in general. This stuff is okay. It absorbs easily. Just didn't notice anything different
I use this cream every single night! I love to put it under my under eyes and on my neck. The scent is very lovely — almost powdery. It goes on very smooth and a little goes a long way! Love love this product!
"I like using this facecream normally. The price is usually higher for the ponds product. The consistency is a little thicker than any other brand. However, I cannot say I saw any improvement in regards to wrinkles"
I love my ponds anti wrinkle cream. It helps keep my face smooth and soft. It is very good for those of us who have sensitive skin. Normally facial care items for sensitive skin have an unpleasant smell that sometimes lingers. This one smells fresh.
"I have to admit that facial care was not something I had in mind or was part or my routine. But as we're not getting any younger, my mom asked me to try this cream and I can say it works, it really works"
Love this cream from Ponds. I've been trying out all sorts of creams to help with fine lines on my face. I have sensitive and dry skin and this cream was gentle but effective. I'm very impressed with it and will buy again.
I love how affordable this product is. I often pick up the travel size at target and it lasts me forever. It's so mistrusting and I feel like my skin is rejuvenated. Great but at a great price and easy to find!
i love this and for the price i've been using this for a couple months now and let me tell you i can see a difference makes my make up look better hydrated your skin and for the price it's super cheap try this bad boy out
"I use this every other night. I swap my creams every other day or so. I don't know why, I just do. Anyways, I've bought this more than once. It's a great value and I definitely recommend anyone who's looking for a night cream to grab it!"
"It smells nice, is affordable, easily available but it's also basic. It's too strongly scented and that means there's likely too much alcohol which I turn ends up drying out my skin and not leaving it moisturized."
"Smells nice, feels nice and it is working to diminish my scar areas. Doesn't work overnight, but I did see some results in the first week of use.Helpful"
Absolutely love this moisturizer ! I use it every morning for a primer before my make up and it doesn't leave me with an oily end. Gives me just the right moisture for an amazing price! And a little pod goes a long way.
This cream is very affordable and lasts a long time. A little goes a long way. It doesn't react with any of my makeup either and leaves my skin soft and hydrated without the oily greasy residue
I love this anti wrinkle cream. I love that my skin doesn't feel oily after I apply it before going to bed. This cream makes my skin feel hydrated and refreshed after I apply it. Pricing is reasonable and I definitely feel like this product works.
I like switching in between product and my second to go product is definitely ponds. Has helped me tremendously and also keeps my sking moistured all day and night. Definitely recommend. I'm almost 40 and it has help with my aging.
"Nothing special. I really dont like the smell. Moisturizes ok, but thats about all"
"are my favorite creams I always take them with me leaves my face very soft, I love to use it always"
Best facial cream sorry dont have photos at this time
Leave my skin so nice and clear and it feels so relaxing I love this so much so hyrdrating
"Doesnt do much in the way of wrinkles, but it still feels great and doesnt have much scent"
its price its size and its results are good for the eye area is moisturizing and it is very fast
"Just bought this product two days ago and I already love it! It goes on smooth, it is not too greasy or too dry. The smell is light and wonderful. I look forward to seeing some results with my fine lines."
"these products are fantastic used it once and I was sold on this, now I don,t have to spend a fortune on others I have tried, got no results from them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for a few days now, twice a day according to the directions. It makes my skin feel greasy no matter how sparingly I use it. Not sure if it works as far as reducing wrinkles but I don't know if I can handle going two weeks with putting this greasy stuff on my face. And I really don't like the scent."
"Wonderful moisturiser for a reasonable price. Works well with my dry/combination skin. However, would not recommend for people with oily skin. This cream leaves my face and neck feeling soft and brand new. It also has helped get rid of some of my acne."
"I have a been using ponds for years, but once I stumbled upon the anti wrinkle moisture I have never turned back. I always struggled on finding a moisturizer light enough to not clog my pores and make my face greasy, but to also moisture well since I have sensitive skin prone to dryness if products are too harsh. I have also noticed a difference in the the fine lines on my forehead! The cold cream and make up removing wipes are also a must have that I use alongside this product!"
"I have been using this product for 2 weeks. I'm 47 and have not used any skin care in years, so I have wrinkles and dark spots. I figured it would take months of using this product to see any results. My skin felt and looked tighter after 7 days. After two week I seen a big change in the texture, fine lines, wrinkles and dark spots. My skin looked healthier. It felt soft and had a healthy glow. This product was sent to me for testing purposes and all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received ponds Rejuveness Anti-Wrinkle Cream from Influenster and got to test out this awesome product. I have used for 2 weeks now and can already tell incredible results. My face feels so much smoother and more vibrant and I look and feel so much younger. I have gotten so many compliments lately and thanks to ponds i feel so much confidence once again! I tested this POND'S products for free, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this thru Influenster to test and review. I was skeptical at first because I've gotten other skin care products that caused serious breakouts. I apply this every morning after i get out of the shower.. Within one week, i noticed the fine lines under my eyes were SO much better.. Within 2 weeks, the crowsfeet were less noticeable. I am curious to see what happens if i stop using this product. BUt so far, i use it every day and it does not cause any breakouts! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Rejuveness anti wrinkle cream for 2 weeks now , twice a day . I have found that my skin is smoother and softer . The scent is slight but pleasant. The only downside to this product is the lack of sun protection. If it had a sunscreen added I would rate this cream a five . I would recommend this product to any one who is worried about aging skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was expecting this cream to be like most others, maybe feels good, smells good, but is a waste of money and does nothing for your skin. I was wrong! In the first week or two that I used this, I started to notice my wrinkles smoothing out! In addition it feels great on your skin and really moisturizes it. It doesn't have a weird smell! I love this and will continue to use this! I received this product free in return for an honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I m very happy I found your product. Till now I have been using very expensive anti-aging face creams from companies like Elizabeth Arden. But this cream is a 100% better. My wrinkles are gone, and I get complements from everybody - especially women, asking me ""what did you do, you look so amazing!"". I am 52. Thank you PONDS for bringing us this amazing product. You have customer for life!!"
"I cannot believe how awesome this product is! I have tried many expensive creams that are just not in my budget but this one is right up there with the best. Powerful moisturizer, rich cream, easily absorbed, fabulous scent, large size jar...I can go on and on. I am 48 and no one ever guesses my age. Thank you Ponds!!!!!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Bought this without thinking and absolutely love it!
I've been using this for several months now and I'm seeing a big difference in my skin texture.
This worked on wrinkles after only one use! Shocked
Just started using this product and so far I like it. It gives my face moisture and suppleness.
"The best anti wrinkle cream ever makes my skin feel soft and smooth, also it is the best cream"
This product is a drugstore poduct not an expensive product and works just like and expensive one
i dislike this product because it causes my skin to appear dry and flaky.
I love this. Keeps my face moisturized and healthy. I love how it makes my face smoother.
Made My skin burn and feel weird. It was affordable and my mom has used it without issues for a while now. Not good for super sensitive skin.
Leaves my skin fresh and moisturized. Removes little wrinkles. Nice for a everyday morning face cream. Product works great.
i love this!! it can make my skin feel kinda greasy afterwards but it does leave you feeling hydrated.
Its so awesome. My mom used it for her wrinkles and there was a very significant result as her wrinkles starts to disappear
"This works amazing! It's the best anti wrinkle product I've ever used, it's such a good price as well"
It has a pleasant scent and doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. I will continue to use and reccomend to others.
Took care of dry patches and reduced fine lines and wrinkles on my face. I swear by this product for my moisturizing needs
This product can be used to take makeup off as well as to moisturize your skin. It leaves the skin soft and not greasy.
i literallly love this product of pond's..... thank you for inventing this product highly recommend..
"is a good cream to moisturize the skin I think it needs more to be an anti-wrinkle, should improve that, I used them as a moisturizer"
I had recieved a sample size of this cream. It was ok for hydration but clogged my pores. I didnt see a difference in the texture of my skin either.
"The texture is a bit greasy and sweaty going on, but it dries pretty quickly. Not bad, just not superior. The smell is odd."
Absolutely love this cream smells refreshing and leaves my skin feeling smooth and flawless! Never leaving me with a greasy or oily film.
"It's my everyday cream, I love it so much, it does not break me out and I really like the scent, it's not in your face kinda scent which is nice"
This thing Smells pretty good so good and kee pi s the moisture locked In into the skin which what I like alot.
"My mom loves and swears by this cream. I never thought she was right but as usual, she is!!! Super inexpensive and works!!!!"
I use the dark spot cream in this and I really love the light texture and clean sent! It is my favorite face cream right now!
I like it. Great value. I like that it doesn't make my skin feel greasy and yucky. A jar actually lasts a while.
Very lightweight and does not cake on the skin. Very good value as I've been using my one tub for about 4 months now
This is one of my favorites. It makes your skin feel really good. I definitely see a difference when I use it on a regular basis.
I'm still in the process of using this. My aunt loves it and it seems too be working but not like I would want it too but it does do something
I bought this as a trial. I did see some brightening around my eyes and a little more hydration but this is not my go to
Is actually working. Finally something cheap that i feel is actually doing the job it is intended to do. Lightweight scent free
"I really worry and stress over my forehead wrinkles, I can tell a difference in about two weeks with this anti wrinkle cream!"
"Affordable and works! Smells great, too! This definitely surprised me. First time user but will def buy again. Met expectations."
I love love this cream. You only need a little and it goes a long way. It isn't greasy and mashed but skin feel amazing. I use after I shower.
Tried it a few months back and heard it was affective. I actually enjoy the smell and feel my results are on par.
I saw a result in one use!! the best product for 40 and older [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I didnt care for this product. Felt greasy, not hydrating. Used it to take off makeup a few times rather than let it go to waste."
I enjoyed this cream very much. My skin was very dry prior to using this product but after I used it just one time my skin was very soft and moisturized. It is an affordable option that is also available at many retailers.
"The scent of this product is so strong, I am glad I only bought the sample size. I could not use this more than one time because of the strong scent that stayed all day."
I bought a trial size and now I continue to buy this product! I haven't noticed a strong scent as some of the reviewers have mentioned. I also just started using the cleansing towelettes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I picked this up to slow the signs of crows feet and because it was a good value for the money. It works well but I find the scent to be overpowering. No irritation and it provides just about the right moisturization for my nightly routine.
"I purchased a small sample and use it nightly. I love the scent; it absorbs quickly; and it has helped my dry skin this winter. My 96 year old aunt has always used Ponds cold cream, and she still has beautiful skin!"
I bought the trail size to test it out and love it! my face feels softer and not dry. I also use it on my neck. I must buy the regular size now. I love the scent too!
"Where would I be without this product? It is keeping me young. Is thick and creamy, smells nice. It rubs in with some effort but I'm moisturized through the night and too the next day. Sometimes I get little pimples from it but its too good to give up"
I have a travel size of this cream that I bought in a pinch for a trip. I like it it's not too harsh or thick and has a light scent. Feels nice and moisturizing on the skin. I'd buy again I like ponds creams. I'd recommend them but I just wish they came with a pump.
"Ponds Rejuveness Anti-wrinkle cream is a great product, it does what it advertises. However, the scent of the product is way too purfumy, over powering really. It's so strong the scent over powers everything. I dislike the scent but love the product, maybe consider an unscented version if there isn't one already, (very Interested if there is)."
I received a free sample for an honest opinion.
The cream is good not greasy it is moisturizing I am very pleased that it has AHA does smooth your face gets rid of layers of dead skin. Very important for anti aging. The onky issue is the strong smell of baby powder or baby lotion. Its awful strong. I love the smell of the Clarant B please give thus the same clean smell of the Clarant. Thank you
I have been using Rejuveness for a few years and I can't believe how well it works.
"I have tried several other fragrance free hypoallergenic creams and lotions in the past and they all seem to fail the test for what I need. I use Rejuveness for a moisturizer for my face and body lotion and it's great. Not greasy, pleasant fragrance, and I don't itch anymore. I am 74 years old and have reduced the look of my aged skin a lot and most people can't believe I'm 74. Excellent product!"
Within 5 days Rejuveness made the 11's between my eyebrows disappear! I have spent hundreds of dollars for fancy creams and none could make that claim. My 82 year old Mom has used the cold cream as a makeup base her entire life. Her skin looks like a 40 year old with a few smile lines.
"I am a two-week user at this point. I find the odor strong, resembling some of the perfumes at the department stores that have a sweaty smell in the background. When first applied, it us a bit tacky but that goes away after a few minutes. I notice good moisture and plumping of the skin but with breaking out around my nose. I will give this cream a few more weeks to see if the breaking out stops and see if I notice improvement in fine lines."
So I had got this from my grandmother in law lol.. I get so many complements I had never was given in my twenties my skin is so soft I use this 3x a day sometimes 4x if I'm not wearing makeup I put it on when I wake up before I apply makeup and after I shower and before bed.
"This product doesn't clog my pores and I like that it is hypoallergenic. In someway it exfoliates my skin and it looks more radiant now than before. I think this product has very good ingredients like AHA, collagen and vitamin E. New skin care must-have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This anti-aging cream boasted less wrinkles in two weeks. I'm not sure any cream can really erase wrinkles, but I did feel a skin-tightening after each application. It had a pleasant scent and was an effective moisturizer. I used this in place of my face lotion. Because I didn't see any real benefits to using this over my face lotion, I probably would not purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I haven't tried it for the full two weeks yet because it is summer and one of the ingredients makes you more likely to get a sunburn, which is already a downside, and I can't tell if it's doing anything, but I don't really have many noticeable wrinkles. It does tingle, and the smell is not my favorite, though it's not awful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product free to sample courtesy of PinchMe. I can't really give you a good review on whether or not it works because I have yet to see any real results yet and I've been using this for about a month now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have to be careful what products I use on my really oily skin. Most make it more oily and cause me to break out! I am 32 and still get pimples. My mom lied. But, the ponds cream did not make the oiliness worse, and made me feel like my face was well moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this cream. It's highly effective, smells great, smooth and soothing. The lactic acid plumps and smooths imperfections -- I mainly use it to treat past acne marks. I'm very satisfied with anti-wrinkle cream and intend to continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is quite a good product. It goes on smoothly but is thick enough for good coverage. However, it is priced too high for my taste. I can get the same result with my current cocoa butter lotion that is way cheaper and NOT tested on animals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this product. Had a nice smell and a creamy feel that blended into the skin easily. This is one I would buy if I needed more of this type of product, but I have 5-6 jars of face cream that I need to use up first. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm a shame to admit but I didn't think of ponds as a quality product up there with some of the other popular brands Once I tried it out I was very impressed I like everything about it smell feel and the texture of the cream and I know that when I buy it I'm going to love the price [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product did not seem right for me. It felt like it left a film on my face when I removed my eye makeup. I also have no use for the anti-aging properties it is supposed to have. It did not irritate my sensitive skin which is always a plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used Pond's for years but this was my first time trying any anti-aging product. I like the way it makes my skin feel but at 25 I don't have any issue with wrinkles or anything so I can't say how well it works for that. It does make your skin feel soft without being too heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like how this product is non-greasy and is easy to apply to the skin. I'm in my mid 20's, but I do have bags and dark patches under my eyes. I apply the cream to under my eyes every night and after a week or so I began to notice less bagginess. I intend to continue using this product as it has shown positive results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this product! It absorbs into my skin well! I do not like the perfumy smell and it really just is too strong for a daily face cream! If they came out with one that was unscented I would totally use it more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love Pond's and their products. this is something I have seen around since watching my grandmother get ready and get ready for bed. So it is always one of those brands that you just trust and I like it a lot. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this cream every night since I received this sample. The only reason why I'm using it as a night cream is because I have a trusted day cream and didn't want to change that. The cream is very soft and smooth. Has a light clean scent that is not overpowering. I haven't seen extreme results but I've only been using it for a few weeks. I hope to see more apparent results the longer I use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This has a mild perfume fragrance, but its appealing and not overwhelming ( for me at least ). After the first time using this I actually felt the skin on my face and neck plump up and FEEL moisturized- I usually cant even tell i applied a moisturizer the first time and have to apply it twice because i feel like i have nothing on. This does not happen with this product, one application is enough, and lasts through the night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I thought I'd try out the Ponds anti-aging line but I still think Olay is my favorite. I haven't seen a difference in my skin at all and I don't like how all of the ponds products smell exactly the same [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked the way my skin felt when applying this moisturizer but it left my skin very shiny and slightly oily. I don't have natural oily skin unless I get a lot of sun but this lotion seems to bring the oil out of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the feel of the Ponds Rejuveness on my skin! It hydrates, releases my tightness, and relieves my dry skin. It feels very soothing and moisturizing without leaving behind a shiny, oily feeling or film. I've been using this in the morning before makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this out thinking it would leave me oily and not expecting anything else from it. I was soooo wrong. I love this stuff. It does Not leave you oily at all and i have oily skin. It's very moisturizing and so soft on your skin. I really, really like it and will definitely purchase. I especially like that the Pond's brand is super affordable. Pond's is not what it use to be. They are in the competition now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I never really used Pond's products before. I have known about the brand forever because of my Grandma, but I was thrilled to try this. Frankly, I will try anything anti-aging to see if it works. I used it even on my neck and it really made my skin feel and look better! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love ponds rejuveness anti wrinkle cream, i keep it by my bed on my night stand so i have it right there every night and some in the bathroom when i clean my morning face. Its great. I reccomend it to every one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's just another product that claims it helps with aging skin and I seen no difference in what I already use. This one was too greasy for me and I hate the feeling of greasy skin. I don't think it would make any difference in my skin. I'm not saying that it won't work at all or on other skin types. It's just not a product for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall this product made my skin feel soft, smooth and was really enjoyable to use. After about a week of use however it made my skin break out and I couldn't use it anymore. I do not blame the product in itself for this however as every person and their skin requirements are different. I would only recommend this to people who do not have sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great basic skincare item to have that works well and does what it says. I just have a minimal complaint about the packaging for the product itself, its a little bulky and jars are not the most sanitary. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As I get older, I find my needs for facial cream has changed. I am always looking for the right mixture of fine lines, dark circles, and age spots. With the awesome sized sample I got from PINCHme, I was able to try a great lotion that has been around and trusted for so long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was super excited to try a new aging product as my skin is getting older. However, I do have skin that reacts to a lot of products negatively. I used this for three days. It goes on great however my skin broke out and I had to stop using it.This may work for others that do not have sensitive skin like myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I would have loved to love this Ponds product but after using it for about 4 days I begin breaking out. At first it was just one pimple but by day 7 I had 4 breakouts. I don't ever get breakouts and this was the only new product I was using at the time. Maybe the formula is just to heavy for my sensitive skin. I also enjoy using scented anti aging products but this one was beyond scented, too much fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cream worked okay, though it's hard to tell if something is effective with only about a week's worth of product. Moreso, I don't like buying skincare or cosmetic products from companies that test on animals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised by the light texture and gentle scent of Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream. I find most anti aging creams to be heavy and dense, but this was very light and easy to wear all day. Highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It make all my skin soft and helps with dryness without blocking pores and causing breakouts. Not sure about if it prevents wrinkles... time will tell..I doubt it..but I love the way my skin feels with it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My mom introduced me to Pond's and I still consider it among the best of the best for skincare. I love the lightweight feeling and light scent. It effectively moisturizes my skin, and I saw a noticeable reduction in fine lines in my face after a few weeks of use. Love! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ponds brand has been around for as long as I can remember. This product is very moisturizing. I don't really use anti-aging products for anti-aging benefit as much as for the moisturization. My skin is very sensitive and POND'S REJUVENESS ANTI-AGING CREAM did not irritate it like some other brands do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It is good stuff, but I found it to be a bit pricey for me. I realize once they put the words ""Age Defying"" on a product it immediately costs more. I have not found any that work any better than the lotions the companies are already selling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product seemed pretty good. I think it does help with looking younger. My biggest problem is that for people who have very light skin like me the increase of a chance of sunburn is too great. I live at a high elevation and even with the extra precautions (sunscreen) my face burned really quick. Super pasty people be careful. If using this product reapply your sunscreen way earlier than you normally would. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Although I do have acne prone skin this did not make me breakout. I have no immediate need for anti aging products (I'm more preventative) I did have my mom try this as well and she loved it. The scent was a little strong [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although the Ponds brand is a household name for me, my mother slathered their cold cream religiously.....I felt it a little bit too greasy for my tastes. I do not like a product to feel heavy on my skin. But I do associate the brand with quality so for someone who isn't sensitive to the weight, it would be fine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It is a name I remember using in my 20's, I didnt see any noticable change to my skin. I would change the packaging, I kept wanting to remove my make up, and had a hard time recognizing it was not a make up remover but a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am all about anti-aging skincare these days, so was happy to try this product. I liked the scent and how smoothly it applied, it absorbed well and didn't make my face shiny! I loved that it has AHAs - great stuff! However...I am pretty happy with the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair that I use at night - I'm all about the Retinol! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do not normally use wrinkle cream but I did have a few lines I noticed recently so I thought this trial would be interesting! Turns out, I don't think I could live without wrinkle cream now thanks to Ponds! I know they are an affordable brand and since my lines I noticed have almost disappeared in 2.5 short weeks, I will definitely be buying!! Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Everyone enjoys a new product that claims to help with aging skin. The product itself left my skin soft but no visible signs of a decrease in wrinkles, laugh lines, etc. No improvement using it for 1 month has led me back to my previous skin regiment that I know works. Thank You though for the opportunity to try your product for free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product says that it visibly reduce the appearance of fine lines in two weeks. I have not used it daily for two weeks straight, but I have been using it off and on. My breakouts are minimal since I've been using this product and my skin overall looks better. I am wearing less makeup because of it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Not sure as to the effects otherwise, but it definitely moisturizes and that's a start. Haven't had it long enough to really tell what all else it may do. It's significantly cheaper than other options I've tried though, which is nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this cream for my daily night time cream, and it's been great! Makes my skin feel so soft! I've only been using it for a few days so I can't speak to the anti-wrinkle properties yet, but hopefully I'll notice some results soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using my sample for a couple of weeks now. I did notice a very slight increase in breakouts while using this, I normally only have breakouts hormonally. My skin usually has dry patches & when using this, they've disappeared. I have sensitive skin, especially on my face, & didn't encounter any issues with this product. It has a smell, but it's not bad & it goes away after a short while. I like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I didn't really have any problem with my aging so I didn't really see any benefits from this brand. I do have to say that I fell in love with how it smells. I would just use it just because of the smell alone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product has a nice scent and goes on smoothly. So far I don't see any results as I still have some in the jar, plus I don't think it's enough to actually see results. I would purchase to try it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm new to the anti age cream, but this one left my skin smooth and smelling very nice! I'm still using the sample I received, it's been 2 weeks and still have some left so I'm sure the full size brand will last awhile, I apply once a day, at night after I wash my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried the original Ponds cream and I hated it. It made my face feel terrible. So I was honestly surprised that this cream worked so well. I still like my current moisturizer better so I won't switch, but if I need another option, this is likely it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I remember Ponds from when i was a little girl, in fact my grandma still uses it. So I knew it was a great brand to put on my face, im liking how my skin feels soo soft, it feels plump and I havent noticed if my slight wrinkles around my eyes have lifted yet but the cream is not heavy or greasy and feels amazing i will continue to buy and recommend it to everyone [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The texture of this cream is much thinner than I am used to in an anti-aging cream however the texture feels nice, absorbs well and has a pleasant light scent. I have only been using this cream at night as I prefer a lotion with sunscreen for day use. I have only been using about 2 weeks so there really aren't any results to report regarding the anti-aging part. Overall happy with the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really loved the product once I put it on. it seems to last right through till morning, and I don't need to rehydrate again until late day. Only problem I had was the packaging. I don't like the fact I have to stick my finger in the jar.........rather have it squeeze out. But I loved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love Ponds brand. It's such a trusted and reliable brand and I've always heard good things about their products. Their creams are great. This cream in particular worked great for me. A little goes a long way. It is very moisturizing and I feel like it does a good job preventing fine lines and wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think Pond's Rejuveness cream is great. It went on smooth and felt good on my skin. I would recommend this brand as an affordable but effective solution to expensive anti-aging creams on the market. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received my sample of POND'S REJUVENESS ANTI-AGING CREAM and started using it immediately. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! It leaves my face feeling refreshed and moisturized without feeling greasy or shiny. I recommend this product if you are prone to oily skin as it does not leave a residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was alright. I like the smell and smoothness of the cream. I did not really notice a difference in my skin after using it for a few weeks. Overall it is affordable and has some good things going for it but I don't know if I would buy it for myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have tried many creams, but never thought of trying ponds. It gave me the impression it wasn't anti aging- just for removing makeup and moisture like before. I was surprised to hear about this one. It's light when putting on so it's easy to spread, but is thick and you can feel it's creates a locked in moisture barrier-feels good. I love it especially on my neck at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is good for all skin types. It's a good consistency and easy to spread all over your face (and neck). IT absorbs quickly and makes your skin feel smooth and instantly smooths your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While I rather enjoy this product as a moisturizer, I'm not so sure about it's anti-aging claims. None-the-less, I really like it as a moisturizer. It feels nice and smooth going on. It absorbs quickly and does not leave my skin feeling greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the ideal ponds went and a anti aging product an it's nice but I compared it to olay night total effects an ponds did not win so I hope the company will improve an make it better'so they you go an you should try it ponds is very nice to use.

"While I would not use alone during the day due to a lack of SPF, I use this with SPF and when I wash my face at night. One application leaves my face feeling smooth and moist unlike my current moisturizer (that has SPF) which depending on the time of year, I need multiple applications, like right now. I definitely plan to buy this once I run out of the sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream made my face feels great. This cream is amazing it made my face soft and smooth. My skin did not feel dry at all like the many other cream I have use. Also it did not feel heavy on my face like many other cream have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
At first I was a bit leery of this product actually working but it stunned me when I felt young again. Many others noticed the difference by just looking at me and asked me how I did it and they've been out and purchased the product as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is light, it has a smooth creamy texture to it. I really love the gentle sent, and that it's a light weight moisturizer and It makes my skin feel soft and silky. It contains, Alpha Hydroxy Acids, collagen and with daily usage you will see how it visibly reduces the appearance of fine lines in 2 weeks. Thanks to PinchME for sending my free sample!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't notice any reduction in wrinkles after using this cream for a couple weeks, but maybe it requires a bit more time before results show up. It smells good and applies well so it's not all bad. Works well as a moisturizer but I'd imagine regular moisturizer is cheaper."
I received a sample of this product in exchange for my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was so happy when I received this product because days before my mom was asking me what brand I would recommend for her to use. After a week of using it, she loves it and I notice the difference on her skin! It's much softer and clear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I thought this would be a really oily/greasy moisturizer but its actually not! its a lightweight cream that sinks in in a matter of seconds. Made my skin feel a bit more plump and firm. didn't break me out. didn't make my skin anymore oily then it already is. the fine lines that i do have did appear less noticeable after 2 weeks of use. only downside is that i did feel like it kind of clogged my pores or left some buildup but just washing my face with a deep cleanser clears that up [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like that this product actually makes your face feel super soft while tightening your skin. I also love that you don't need alot a little goes a long way so one bottle will last you a while depending on if you are using it on your whole face or like me using it under your eyes and around your mouth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is so luxurious. I can feel it soak into my skin and not leave me greasy. The first thing that made me want to continue using was how fast it soaks in and the great smell oh the smell I run to wash my makeup away at night and use this. I will biy the full size and make my main moisturizer I love this stuff. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the smell of it and the feel of it when i put it on my face. I do notice some improvement after a couple of days of using it. i would definitely recommend it to others who is in need of a product that helps prevent aging. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I haven't been using the cream long enough to review on what results will be seen but I can say that it applies nicely and absorbs nicely. Occasionally I notice a little residue in certain areas but it may just be from using too much product in those places. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Unfortunately, I had really high hopes for this product. I don't really have any wrinkles on my face because I'm still young, but I tried this product on my forehead and it broke me out severely within the first couple ways. Then I tried it on my neck and saw no results, even when used consistently over a considerable amount of time. I liked the texture and the smell, but the product didn't perform well enough for me to consider purchasing it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ok...I've never used a Ponds product before as it always reminded me of my grandma. I have to tell you that I have fallen in love with this product! I would apply it each night after I cleaned my face. It smells SO good...relaxing even, it penetrates the skin very quickly leaving no greasy feeling at all, and I can tell such a difference in the softness of my skin! I will absolutely be purchasing this product this month! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm a guy just to let everyone know. The sample was big enough for wife and I to both use it. We are a young looking couple in the first place. We both used it for a month now I think. Not only does it lightens the wrinkles but it also makes you're so smooth and soft. I think it's great. It also smells really good. My wife thinks she should be writting this but if a man says its good for lightening wrinkles it must be. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a little bit of a heavier face cream, so it worked really well as a travel product (plus it was travel sized) because my face tends to get a little dryer when I fly, etc. I live in a humid climate, so I have to use a lighter face product for every day use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't mind this product - I have and use another Pond's product, the regular moisturizing cream. But he said this product had a smell that he just couldn't stand. He said it smelled ""old"" - I didn't think it smelled too dissimilar from other Pond's products but, I have to sleep next to my husband! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Feels very smooth and hydrating. Great travel size for taking on trips. It gave good results, but irritated by skin with an intense tingling sensation. If you don't have sensitive skin this product should work great for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really wanted to try this for an extended period of time but I can't because the scent is too strong for me and I had to wash it off after first use. Maybe if it came in an unscented variety I would try again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was not fond of the smell. It smelled like all of the other Ponds products. It has had the same smell for at least had the same smell for at least 25 years. I also didn't notice any benefit from this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I feel like maybe over time I could understand the need to use this product but it was too small of a sample to understand the need for it. I also feel that aging is a natural thing so why is a product necessary to prevent that? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It left my skin very smooth and soft. I had a nice dewy youthful completion with it on, but after a few days it caused me to break out on my chin. All the good anti-aging stuff does! So cruel to have wrinkles and acne at the same time! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"After using POND'S REJUVENESS ANTI-AGING CREAM for a week I love it. My other brand which I pay high dollar for and have been using it for over two years now. Doesn't compare to the nice, fresh scent Ponds has. And it does make my face feel softer and looks smoother. I will change my current brand to Ponds starting NOW. thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the Pond's name, and reputation. I also like the feel of the product on my skin, the way it works and the overall quality. My only complaint is the way that it smells. It reminds me of my grandma. I would certainly recommend it, peoples tastes in scent are different. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I am only 22 so I dont really have any wrinkles but I think its never too early to start preventing them. I have sensitive skin and it had no reaction to the cream which is good. Also it did a very good job at keeping my face soft.would reccomend to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I trust the Pond's brand but have very sensitive skin. I am allergic to many facial products and cannot wear make-up. I had an allergic reaction to the product but would recommend it otherwise. It feels nice and smells great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was my first experience with the Pond's brand and I really enjoyed it! This moisturizer felt very clean and natural compared to other products I've tried. Plus, it had collagen which I liked! I will definitely look for more products from this brand! It's Hypoallergenic too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have never heard of this type of serum before, never in my entire life. But when I got the opportintiy to try out this product for free from Pinchme, I knew I had to have it. I have already replaced my daily routine with this serum. It's fast acting and a little goes a long way. It's thick but not too thick, glides on amazing and makes you feel great all day. I highly recommend and approve. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received a sample of Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream to try and review. It felt rich on my skin, was easy to distribute over my face and neck, and left my face feeling refreshed. I looked up the price and found it's not as expensive as some of the other anti-aging creams. I definitely think I'll be picking up a jar of Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream when I'm out of the sample (which was quite generous!). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I've never been big on anti aging stuff but I recently tried the Revitalift stuff and thought I would give this a try too. I like the cream, it's nice and soaks into the skin quickly and doesn't leave much behind. It's not quite as effective as the Revitalift but I imagine that it's not as expensive either.

"I thought the Pond's cream was interesting to try as I was not aware that the company was offering moisturizers in their line just the old-fashioned cleansing ""cold Cream:..

Ponds anti-aging was a great product. I love the Ponds brand but it can be a little expensive so I love that I could try the product to see if it would work for me before purchasing it. Ponds was not greasy and I feel like it really helped my wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this for two weeks. I don't know if it's because I don't need it or not but I did not see much improvement. I did like the way it moisturized but not enough to warrant the need to buy it right now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The 1st evening, I used Ponds, I didn't really notice a difference. If wasn't until about the 3 day, that I woke up and felt the difference. My skin was smooth and glowing. The black bags plus the wrinkles in the corner of my eyes were going away. I just couldn't believe it. It make me feel like a new person. Like, people were going to just stare at me because they could visibly see the aging in my face. Ponds is fixing that for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed the sample. seems to work very well. there was enough to try for a long time to ensure that it really works well. my skin actually felt smoother and moisturized even a little tighter. keep up the good work making affordable face cream for people that need it and cant afford to buy the super expensive stuff [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using the Ponds brand for awhile but not I realize they have more products for more effects. I was very pleased with this one as it doesn't have a smell like their cold cream does. It was very soothing to apply and made my skin feel better overall. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had heard about this from an article I'd read so I was quite excited it was part of my sample box! I've almost used all of the bottle so that means 1- I like it that much and 2- I better hurry up and buy some ASAP! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have tried almost everything. This is the very best so far. I makes my face feel soft and works to soften the wrinkles. It is not a cream that professes to make wrinkles less noticeable. It really does soften them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have been very happy using my POND'S REJUVENESS ANTI-AGING CREAM sample. I must say it was beyond awesome getting an almost full sized product to test so I have been able truly see the results.

"I have combo skin and am getting really bad wrinkles from tanning beds.

My skin is finicky and many anti aging treatments involve moisture and my skin breaks out from it. In my opinion the cream is quite heavy. If you have a tendency towards drier skin this might be a blessing. It was a bit of a headache for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Sensitive to smell to texture as I put the product on for me it made my skin tingle and I got a little red I'm allergic to everything so it's nice to be able to get a little samples to try products I'm always willing to try though it's hard for me to find products I can use [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

A small amount of the Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream goes a long way. It has a nice texture to it and you really don't need to use a whole lot of it. I don't have a lot of wrinkles (yet) or age spots but I think it helped a little. I would buy the full size of this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My wife loves this stuff and she suggested I try it out. I like how it leaves my face feeling and looking. I work in a hot factory and sweat a lot my face gets a lot of hard products on it while I'm there so that's why I started to use this product and it's helped my face feel moisturized and plus helping me with aging.

"I have to say this is a nice affordable cream for those looking to prevent or help with aging. However, I usually will buy much more high end products, myself. I have to be careful since even with skin that is just starting to see fine lines, I have very oily , breakout prone skin so I have to be very careful with what I ise. For me this was a bit too heavy, personally. I would recommend to other skintypes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Product felt amazing during application and I loved the texture of my skin. Unfortunately the scent was so strong I developed a headache and had to discontinue use.

I grew up seeing Pond's products on the vanities of my grandmother and my mother. It's refreshing in a way that the brand is still going strong after so many years. I've only been using this product a short time and have not yet had any noticeable results. I would recommend this product simply because I am so comfortable with the Pond's brand and trust their products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"There are so many different types of face cream out there, it's honestly a bit overwhelming. I just now started looking into these products and ponds was a good product to start with. It made my face feel good and I enjoyed it. Definitely worth a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"in a anti-aging product! Not too thick or goopy, it absorbs quickly, skin feels just right after use. Only used it for a few days so far, not long enough to see reduction of wrinkles. Regardless I will quite possibly continue to use it after finishing up with the sample."
Lovely scent too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using this cream 3 weeks ago and really like the texture of it! It is a thicker cream that needs to be pressed on when applying. It also has a light fragrance to it. It feels like it tightens my face, and the best part is that it doesn't dry my face or leaves it oily, It's also very affordable! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like and admire that Pond's has been around as long as it has been on the market for skincare, but I certainly wish that some of their products didn't have such a strong smell and didn't come in a jar but in a pump so that the product isn't wasted.

"Being that I already take good care of my skin and don't have anybody noticeable wrinkles, this product wasn't necessarily what I was seeking. However, having used this product for the past few weeks my skin seems smoother and tighter. I may continue using this product to see what other results I may get.

I did not notice the wrinkles diminishing but I ran out of my normal facial moisturizer and used this in it's place. It had a nice light scent it rubbed in well and did not leave my face feeling greasy. I like to use more natural based products though. That is my only negative.

"I liked the level of moisture this cream gives. I think Ponds has been improving and ""updating"" their brand. I only have one con on this product and that was it's heavily perfumed scent.

Although I'm not too concerned about wrinkles yet I wanted to try this product for skin rejuvenation. I really loved how creamy the product was and how it moisturized your skin overnight. It wasn't too greasy or sticky. I don't have deep wrinkles yet so I can't speak about the anti-aging aspect but it did make my skin look more plump and supple as opposed to dry and dull.

I loved that this didn't have a strong odor and went on smoothly and wasn't greasy. I was a little hesitant to use it on my face since I have extremely sensitive skin but it worked well on my neck and I didn't break out or have a reaction. It is wonderful to be able to use something that doesn't give my allergies a work out from the smell and not feel like I'm greasy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At first, this product was great - left my skin feeling soft and smooth. However, after a couple of uses it began drying out my skin.

"I began using the Pond's Rujeveness cream right away after I received my sample.

POND'S REJUVENESS ANTI-AGING CREAM is a wonderful product. It only takes a small amount. It made my skin feel silky. It also softens the look of my wrinkles. I also thought well let me try some on a few age spots I have on my hands. I have nothing t o lose. It has made them not so noticeable which makes me very happy.

"Well, I don't know, I always thought Pond's was for the Cold Cream my aunt used when I was a kid. I never really heard or saw anything else about it recently. I tried the sample for a week and it wasn't bad, but there was nothing great about it either. I would say that it performs in an average way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm pretty brand loyal to L'Oreal Revitalist products for my daily skin care regime. I've always thought of Pond's as ""my mother's brand"". However, after trying the sample of POND'S REJUVENESS ANTI-AGING CREAM, I am now considering incorporating Pond's into that regime as well. Left my skin feeling hydrated and smells great.

"At this time, I do not need/use a product like this so I cannot give it a full review. I was hoping that someone else in my family would have been able to use it, but I couldn't not find anyone willing to try something different than what they currently use.

"I remember the jar of Ponds cold cream on my Grandmother's windowsill and she was born in 1889!! I have pretty much always thought of Ponds as. being a good brand but, not really a brand for me. After trying this, I have to say I have changed my mind. I was very impressed and will be looking for this in the store. Thank you to #PinchMe for allowing me to try before buying this.

"Normally Ponds is a great product to go to for skin care. However, there was something with this sample that changed all that for me. I ended up with an allergic reaction -- an uncomfortable itchy sensation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I know Pond's is a reputable company with a quality product. I don't feel like I've had enough time to adequately rate this product, but from the use I have gotten from it, it has been great!! If I keep enjoying this product I plan on purchasing it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product really works. I love how easily it massages into my skin and I notice all my fine liens minimized. My make up apply's evenly and there is a wonderful glow with my skin throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It's funny our daughter Morgana put it on with me ... thus the ponds tradition continues. A little goes a long way and silk smooth to put on. I forgot to take a before photo but have been getting compliments on how glowing my skin has been here recently. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i used this product about 4 times. it did feel like it was firming and didnt dry my skin out too much. the only complaint i had was the slight itch i had on my neck and face from using this and my skin isnt even very sensitive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
OMG i truley love this cream. i put it on every nite before bed. i have seen a difference in my wrinkles even the deep ones on my forehead. Thank you Jesus. this will be something that i will buy even after i am out of the genouruse sample is gone. that is why it is so inportant to give samples and in a large enought size that the consumer can see the difference. I am a ponds women. thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream was nice and thick. It was easy to apply and it absorbed well. It had a strong scent to me that reminded me of baby powder. It smelled nice, but I didn't like smelling it all day on my skin. I don't have many wrinkles or lines yet, so it's hard for me to say if it worked for this.

"I trust the ponds brand because it's what I mom used ever since I can remember, and she always have beautiful skin. I really liked this face cream because I immediately noticed a soft feeling to my facial skin after just 3 uses! I now make a part of my everyday routine when caring for my face. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was such a nice sized sample in a very cute container that fits right in my purse. I have been using this product for only two and a half weeks so far and I am already starting to notice a difference in my fine lines. It leaves my face feeling fresh and hydrated as well plus it doesn't clog pores which is fantastic. I love all of Pond's products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have many skin issues and aging is starting to add itself to the list as well. I liked the gentle feels of Ponds as well as the light fragrance. I have veey break out prone skin and Ponds kept things calm and moisturised. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the first anti-aging product that I have tried. I started using it about two weeks ago, as directed, and I feel that my skin looks clearer and brighter and smoother. I found the price to be really reasonable compared to other brands and I am pleased with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for a couple of weeks, both morning and evening and I have to say I don't really see any change. This is a relatively inexpensive product, something that I would recommend to someone in their 20's that is just now starting a skin care routine . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can't tell you if this product works or not unfortunately. The scent alone is too strong and I am sensitive to smells. This would not be a good product for a person like me because of the smell. If it was scent-free, I would love to try aagain [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for just over a week, and I really like it. It is not too greasy and has a pleasant smell. It is too early to say what the long term effects are going to be and if it really does make one look younger and youthful, but time will tell! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was happy with this product. It made my skin feel soft without a strong smell. I received a free sample, which was not enough to know how well the cream works with anti aging long term, but I was happy with the product and will probably buy it in the future.

"I've heard of Ponds ever since I was a kid. My mom trusted this brand. But I don't think this cream is for me. After washing my face, I put a thin layer on. The next morning my face felt greasy. I'm sure it's a great product, just not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ponds is by far a very trusted brand that is pretty much timeless...the cream was very nice and glided across my skin and was easily absorbed. It has a fragrance that takes you back, so to speak.. alittle product goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The smell and texture is great. I could feel a tingle after applying it. I used it for three nights in a row, and on the third night, it made my face turn red. For something that is supossed to be used for two weeks, that isn't a good result. I do not have sensitive skin, so the redness was a very unusual reaction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin loves this cream. The first time I put it on I expected it to leave my skin feeling oily. My skin drank it up and made it feel fresh. I used it for a few days and then went out and bought more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I loved the product and it did work, however I felt like it left my skin feeling greasy! I know I have oily skin to begin with but I felt like I needed to wash my face by the end of the day again, I usually only have to wash once a day or once every other day!

"I have tried various different products that are similar in function, however, this one seems to work the best. I have combination skin, and currently have some dryness issues due to a nasty sunburn. This product has, surprisingly, worked really well as a moisturizer and to help correct not only aging issues, but also the dryness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Tried this product for a few days. Kind of felt a bit greasy. I have very oily skin and my makeup felt oily throughout the day. I think I will stick to my current high end moisturizer for now. I would recommend to someone who is more on the dry side. Other than that I think its a great product just not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this product and have noticed a great difference in the texture of my skin. Now, I am only 20 and have no wrinkles but my skins texture has improved I promise you that. Not only is this a great cream , but it smells lovely as well . Not at all overbearing or gross . It is the perfect light scent. This is great , not greasy and is perfect for underneath makeup . No primer needed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't have a large amount of wrinkles, actually fewer than I can count on one hand. If I had more, maybe I would have noticed a difference but I didn't notice any positive change in my skin while testing this product. My skin felt weirdly oily after application of the cream and, even though I should be long past them, I actually had a bit of an acne breakout while using it. I wouldn't use it again and can't recommend it based on my experience with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this in the dead of summer. I thought it would be too heavy at first. The free sample I received was enough to try for two weeks and i saw results. My skin was smooth, and not oily or greasy. The product did go on a bit heavy but soaked into my much needed skin. It made it appear firmer and I noticed my neck area more smooth after two weeks.

"Love love this Pond's Rejuveness Anit-Aging Cream. Been using this product as directed and my face is looking much more WOW!! Everyone has noticed that my face looks glowing and health. A young look and feeling, I feel since I started using it. Definitely will buy more and recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After almost 2 weeks of using the Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream I have to say my skin is smooth but I haven't noticed much of a change in my wrinkles. Mine are subtle on my forehead a result of my natural facial expressions but I wouldn't mind them be less noticeable without the use of a needle. This product smelled wonderful and I will likely try again when the weather is more mild. (100 degree summers with 90% humidity probably didn't help) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have not used a wrinkle product in the past. I have only been using it for a couple of days so I don't see a huge difference in my skin. Anything that helps me look younger is for me. I do love the smell and hope it does show some difference in my skin. Maybe someone will ask me for my ID when I am out and about. lol [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am in my early 30's and not too worry about wrinkles.. BUT i absolutely love this cream. It's lightweight which is perfect for someone who hates very heavy creams. I have very sensitive skin and even found that it helped eliminate some of my adult acne! Definitely a game changer for my morning and evening beauty routine!

"I got this sample just in time! After getting some prescription face creams from my dermatologist, my skin got dry patches and flaky. I used the Pond's Rejuveness Anti-aging Cream to correct this and moisturize my face and have a few less wrinkles. I do not like the word rejuveness though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Im not sure why people buy this product. It's filled with mineral oil. I think they should remove mineral oil out of their ingredients. This makes peoples pores clog and it also breaks people out because their pores are too clogged from the oil. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I would like to give this product three stars, since I am still unsure of the claims it makes. It smells and feels wonderful though. I haven't noticed any change at all in my skin since using. It may just be that the sample didn't last long enough to note a change, so I am on the fence. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is a very nice smelling soft cream. Good on my sensetive skin. I would recommend this product just as much as major competetors. I do not see any particular benefits over Olay, unless price is notably difference [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this anti-aging cream most make your skin feel really greasy afterwards and it takes awhile for you to start feeling or seeing improvements but after a week use I could already see improvements on the fine lines around my eyes I'm looking forward to trying this for a longer period Of time [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I haven't used Ponds before, but I thought this was a good quality and very soft and smoothing, nice smell. Its definitely a little greasy for day use, but I liked it for night. I think it might have made my skin break out a little, but I do have sensitive acne prone skin, and don't usually use heavy moisturizing products like this. If I don't use very much, and apply at night before bed, it has a very nice finish and makes my skin feel smooth in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This product was heavily scented with a flowery scent, and I prefer a lighter scent, however, it wore off quite quickly. The product was thick and heavy but surprisingly did not feel too bad once on - it kind of melted in. Very moisturizing for my dry skin which was good.

"I loved my free sample of Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream. The scent was faint but pleasant. The cream was the perfect consistancy. It felt smooth and moisturizing. My face feels smooth & soft, moisturized but not greasy. Very beneficial to help in preventing wrinkles! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this every night and it is great! I had never tried Ponds before and I was pleasantly surprised. This product was light on my face and neck. It was refreshing and not sticky. I would use this product over and over. Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So the product is great, smells great, a light powdery fresh scent. Goes on skin and makes it feel moisturized and not to heavy. Sadly though everything from this comapny makes my fave break out. Yes it smooths creases but then I have a face full of zits. This product would be a great buy if it didn't cause breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cream is very smooth, easy absorbs in my skin, doesn't feel greasy at all. I like it very much because it saves time in the morning when you are in a rush. I like the very gentle smell, doesn't smell like perfume or medicine unlike some other creams I've tried. I even like the packaging! Overall the Pond;s brand came up again with a great product.

"Hi I have been using this for a week or so now and I can say honestly my skin looks a bit more better im sure longer use will make those fine lines and wrinkles appear gone im sure, but I have only been using it for a week so it has brighten my skin a bit.

"The sample I got in the mail was a very generous size. I have been using it for a few weeks. Although my skin does feel better overall after use, I really don't see much of a difference in reducing wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the powdery fragrance this product has, and the velvety feel it left my skin. I used the product for 2 1/2 weeks, and didn't see a dramatic difference with minimizing fine lines and wrinkles. I do love the Pond's brand, always has a trusted, reliable reputation. Unfortunately results vary depending on the person's skin. I had high expectations but was disappointed.

"I gave my sample to my wife and she loved it, she said it made her skin feel great she said that one the sample was gone she was going to get some more.

"Ponds anti aging cream is exactly what you need to have if you're wanting to feel and look younger. This cream was so soft putting on and the fragrance was just right, unlike some other overwhelming scents.

"This cream is thick and goes on smoothly, unfortunately it is hot and summertime and it kind of makes me feel sweaty and that my face can't 'breathe.' Might be better during the winter.

First I will start by saying that I subscribe to several monthly beauty subscription boxes and am always trying new anti-aging products. After using Pond's Rejuveness for a couple of weeks I think it works better than most really expensive anti-aging creams. After a few days I thought that I could see a noticeable decrease in the fine lines around my eyes. The only slight downside is it isn't as moisturizing as some products so I had to add a moisturizer on top of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I dislike that there's no SPF in this product so for me it has to be worn under another lotion with sunscreen, except at bedtime. I did, however, like the wrinkle reduction I've seen! I'm also not too crazy about the scent, but I don't hate it, either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream is a wonderful product. I love how it makes my skin feel. I have told everyone that it is very affordable and they should use it as well.

"I love this product so much. I love the texture, the scent, the packaging, and the results. It's so creamy and easy to apply and soaks into the skin nicely while not leaving a greasy feeling behind.

"I love how easy this was to put on, a little bit does go a long way and it's lightweight, so I barely knew I had it on.

I like the way the product smells. It is a little to thick for my liking but it does feel grease less after it is on. I did not see any real difference in the fine lines and crepiness of my skin as compared to the Olay product that I use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I remember being a kid and staying with my great grandmother and she always used Ponds cold cream at night! She had the most beautiful skin even up til 97!

"I feel like this product works well, I haven't noticed any significant skin changes, but I also don't have much for wrinkles, so for me, it's hopefully preventing them in the first place, and moisturizing my skin, hasn't caused breakouts for me, which is a normal concern of mine.

"My Mother used Ponds ever since I can remember, so that was the first skin care product I ever used. I started using other things in my late 30's. I did not know that ponds had an anti-aging product. It seems to work as well as the costly ones. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used to use the Pond's cold cream 10 years ago. I was surprised to find out that Pond's had fancier new creams to try out. This cream is very moisturizing and rich.

I am quite young but I think you are never too young for anti aging products. I've used ponds lotion before and I love it. I have not seen any real difference in my skin but that is probably because wrinkles are not a major factor yet for my skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am very happy with this product! I already plan on buying more next time i'm at the store. The scent is very light and fresh and it seems to be hydrating my skin.

I received this product as a free sample from PinchMe. I thought it was a very good sized sample as it gave me the ability to actually use it for a long enough time to see results.

Sample size was sufficient to give honest opinion on product. Packaging was ok. Not fan of twist top. Smell I can tolerate but some may not like it. Smell like my grandmothers creams and lotions growing up. Consistency it is thick. Used product for about 2 weeks. Did not see any drastic changes in skin. When I applied at bedtime I felt my skin was more hydrated and I have very dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have a bit of a love hate relationship with this product because I love the fact that it is affordable, but I hate the fact that it hasn't done much to my skin as far as ""anti-aging"" goes. If your looking for a good moisturizer that will keep your skin nicely hydrated and healthy it's a great option, but if you are looking for fast acting visible results (lift or wrinkle filling effects) this isn't the product for you.

I have been using my sample every day of Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream. I have not yet noticed much difference in my skins appearance but feel the sample was not enough to give it a good test.

I do not have any wrinkles or aging on my face that is so sever that I need to use this. I do like Pond's normal facial lotions and those make my face feel nice and look nice.

Didn't have a good experience with this product but I had been out in the boat and got too much sun. I broke out not sure if it was the sunscreen or this product. Did not have enough to try after the breakout healed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love how thick this cream is. I have dry skin and feel like it definitely keeps my skin moistured. However, this cream has an unpleasant scent to it. I only apply it before bed though so I can deal with the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In comparison to what I have been using, it's a good cream for the money. The smell is very strong, though and burned my eyes. It's very perfumey. I actually like the texture and feel of the cream itself, and it's nice and lightweight! My only issue is the smell is quite strong. I wish it were unscented. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It is extremely difficult to find a product that actually works for me but Pond's did it! It was absolutely effective and it didn't leave my face feeling oily and irritated like most products. My face felt smooth, beautiful, REJUVENATED and I couldn't be happier about it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't use anti-aging products often even though I just 27 and I should hop on that. I don't currently have wrinkles so by using this I could not tell a difference. I did read the best time to start an anti-aging regimen is when you don't need it. So, in saying that I was pleased with the texture of this product and it wasn't heavy so my face felt like it could breath. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this product!!! Haven't had any visible results yet but I haven't broken out nor had any dry skin as a result of use. Doesn't have a strong scent or greasy feel like other brands. Doesn't stand up well to sweat, recommend usage at night as opposed to morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My husband told me after using this product for a week how my skin looked softer and younger looking. Every woman I. Her 40s wants people to tell her how younger looking she lookks. I will continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used my Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream on my face in the attempts to minimize the look of the bags under my eyes. After several applications of the cream I believe that the bags under my eyes are getting less and less noticeable and therefore I worry less about them. The cream does have a strong smell, so I would recommend putting it on in the evening or before bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This anti-aging cream smelled good and didn't feel oily when applied! It has more of a moisturizing gel feel than a standard lotion. It seemed to moisturize well, didn't irritate my skin, and worked well with my normal routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I used this product, it went on smoothly and lightly without a greasy after feeling. I can't really say it removed any wrinkles, but it does help with facial dryness, which will hopefully prevent any future ones. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ponds is a brand that my mother would use and I know find my self using it. Its just a brand that keeps up with the times and performs wonders for the skin. If you like your skin smooth and silky then this is one you should try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product itself is pretty decent. It's moisturizes nicely, without feeling too heavy on the skin. But the smell, UGH, THE SMELL! It reminds me of whatever perfume it is that EVERY old lady wears. It's just awful, and it doesn't go away! I probably would have continued using the product if it didn't smell so awfully perfum-y, but as it is, it's going in the trash. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Nothing bad to say about this moisturizer. Its very hydrating, slightly on the greasy side for my liking but it's fine if it's being used as a night time moisturizer. Not something I'd buy because I have oily skin but it's a good option if you just want a basic night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I got great results using Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream. My skin is softer and looks healthier and younger. :) I love that it soaks in quickly and has a non-greasy feel. It didn't irritate my sensitive skin either which was great! The only thing I didn't enjoy was the cream has a pleasant smell but when you put it on your whole face it really was too overpowering and made my eyes water/sting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did not like this one at all. The smell on this is incredibly heavy and eventually the product caused my skin to break out. I only used it once and would not use again since I never get breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am surprised by this cream. I have never used Ponds before but i will start now. This is so creamy and makes my skin feel so smooth and soft. I haven't really noticed a difference in wrinkles but I'll keep using it to see. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This is a great product but I have been recently experiencing a ton of breakout and I am unable to trace it back to the source because I was using so many different products on my face. So for now, I will not be using this moisturizer until I can find the root of my breakouts. However, when I tested the product out, It left my face feeling super hydrated and rejuvenated. The smell was amazing and the consistency of the product was even better., [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleasantly surprised when I tried this Ponds Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream. It feels like I am applying liquid silk on my face and it has a pleasant light scent.

"As with most Ponds products, this cream was too scented. It was too much and lingered for longer that I'd like. It's not necessary to add scent to a product, and they really should eliminate it from their entire brand. I like the feel of the cream itself, but not enough to exchange it with my existing routine.

"After using this cream in only a couple days my skin feels brighter, i was told i look more awake today i think it brightens up skin tone then after a couple weeks I was happy with how my face looked, it was more awake looking, fresh and brighten up the fine lines i have around my eyes are hardly noticeable now.

I received a free sample of Pond's rejuveness anti-wrinkle cream from Pinchme to try. I scent was a little strong for me so I didn't use it for the full 2 weeks to see if the cream works. The cream goes on smooth and doesn't feel oily. Pond's is a brand that I trust and if the scent was slightly less I would be really enthused about this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"In my opinion, both the weight and scent of this product are too heavy for me. The scent reminds me of the creams my grandmother used when I was growing up. After applying it (sparingly) I had to wash it off (couldn't handle the smell)... but I will say that my skin did feel soft afterward. Perhaps if the product was unscented (and lighter weight), it would be good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

My mother always used Ponds cold cream and I remember as a child pretending to be grown up putting it on my face. I always loved the feel and the smell of it and now with the newest version I can use it and remember the good times at the same time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm not 100 percent sold yet. I loved the smell it's not too far from the traditional old school ponds smell. Also kind of left an oily feel. I think I noticed a small change in the fine line wrinkles. Will keep using to see if better long term effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am a long time fan of the Ponds brand and the REJUVENESS ANTI-AGING CREAM did not disappoint!

"This is a great, thick moisturizer to use every morning. I have been using it every day for about a week and I have noticed that at least underneath my eyes looks more hydrated and youthful. I'm only 23 and have normal creases under my eyes but I've noticed they don't look as defined and my skin looks all around healthier there. A little goes a long way, too. Not 100% sure I will buy, as I prefer natural skincare, but I'll definitely consider it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked the texture of the cream. I was a little hesitant at first because my skin can be sensitive but this didn't give me any problems. I liked that there wasn't a strong scent. I would say I am neutral to this product because I still have to finish what I have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I was skeptical at first. I have used Ponds forever as a makeup remover not anything else. A lot of my friends say How do I keep from getting wrinkles.I have always said to moisturize your face when you take off your makeup with ponds. Now that I am older I have been using an anti wrinkle cream just because. I don't want to start getting wrinkles. I am very happy that my favorite brand has this product.

"Unfortunately, this product is way too heavy for my skin. Living in AZ, especially during the humid monsoon season...I was sweating even more when I used this. I'm sure it could be beneficial to some and I may try it again once the air dries out here. I will say that it has a pleasant scent, my skin felt softer and moist.

"I use this as a facial moisturizer and that's about it. Like all the other creams and lotions, they do not do what they say they do. They moisturize your skin and that's it. They don't make you look younger, they don't get rid of dark spots, etc. I buy it because it is cheap and works well as a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have tried almost everything advertised and on the market. This is the very best so far. It makes my face feel soft and works to soften the wrinkles. It is not a cream that professes to make wrinkles less noticeable. It really does soften them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product worked great. My skin feels amazingly smooth and my skin feels firmer. It is hard to find a anti-aging face cream product that actually does its job, but with this product you actually get noticeable results after just a few uses.

"As silly add this may sound, this product over moisturized my skin. Every time I used it, day or night, hot or cool, may have was sweaty.

I was surprised by the results I saw from this product in just 2 days. I have larger pores and nothing has really seemed to work in the past to diminish the size.

I noticed a difference in my skin's appearance within the first couple of days using this! I looked refreshed and my skin was brighter. I have combination skin and it did not leave an oily residue.

I have been using this for about three weeks now and am very happy with my fresh looking appearance! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The cream has a very nice and light fragrance. The texture feel rich and velvety soft but that's all the pros of the cream. The cream feel heavy on my face.

The consistency was nice but unfortunately the scent was the traditional, strong, fake smell that reminds me of cosmetics from 20 years ago and those scents trigger headaches for me.

My Mom always use Oil of Olay every night and that image of that bottle on her counter with the pink cream is actually a warm memory. I am attached to Olay products because my Mom was so in love with them and stated how well they worked.

"I am super young, but I know that the key to fighting wrinkles is to start applying wrinkle cream before you get wrinkles instead of after. I use this stuff as a moisturizer/primer for my makeup and then at bed time. My skin is so soft after use, and although I don't have wrinkles to see if it defies wrinkles, I can definitely feel it doing something.

I'm not sure if this item worked. I used it for about a week. I am skeptical about items such as these because I'm not sure if the product is actually working or I'm just not getting wrinkles. It did not irritate my skin and smelt pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used ponds products in the past and the one thing I don't like about them is the greasy feel it leaves you with and this one was no exception I already have oily skin so they may have something to do with it honestly I'm not sure if it does but it's a possibility. I learned about ponds as a teen by my adopted mother who swears by it. She loves it I just don't think it's for me. I didn't really notice much of a difference in my skin either.

She said it applied very smoothly and the consistency of the product was a good texture. She felt that it was a good night cream and after the product ran out, she felt it did tighten her face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I noticed a significant difference in the texture and overall moisture level of my skin. I used the product at night and when I woke up, I instantly looked refreshed and a few years younger. I also noticed that my previous acne scars are starting to fade slowly. My pores seem smaller as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I gave this to my mother to try since I do not use anti aging products. She is in her fifties but doesn't look a day over 30. She doesn't have a need for such a product and doesn't have any wrinkles. However, she claims she loves this stuff. I guess prevention is better than cure.

i have been using this for over a week so far... i an in my early 30s so im looking for prevention. i know that i am starting to notice some sun spots on my face and will give this a few months to see if i notice anything more. patience is key with these types of products.

"I used this in conjunction with my neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair, at nighttime after washing my face. I found it provided nice moisture to my skin, non irritating, and no breakouts from usage. While I didn't notice a visible difference in wrinkle repair, it is a nice cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I always use some kind of moisturizing cream on my face due to dry skin. Some I've used have made my face feel greasy and some feels like I've not applied anything to my face. This product was great because it wasn't greasy but yet it kept my face moisturized, my make up went on smooth after applying but didn't feel heavy. I'm not sure if it has helped with wrinkles because I haven't been using it long enough. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Like the feel of this product, but do not know if anything really gets rid of wrinkles. Problem with skin care products, is when you find one you like, the company changes it or stops making it. Why they can't leave things alone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was please with this product. It doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy and it smells great. I haven't used it long enough to tell if it makes a difference on my fine lines but the sample came with a nice amount of product so I will continue to use it and see. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product, to me, was a little to thick. It stayed on my hands afterwards and felt a little uncomfortable. What I did like was when I put it on before bed, I felt it on my skin which I knew would help but after a few days, I still didn't really notice much. The smell is a little strong especially if you are going to have it on your face while you sleep, maybe a cleaner neutral scent would work better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is going to be my new face creme. Lightweight, yet very moisturizing. Does not leave any kind of greasy residue. Disappears immediately, with immediate results on my skin. The scent is amazing. I don't have anything bad to say about this creme. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
If you are looking for a product that is going to make you look younger and or make you feel beautiful I highly recommend this product it is very effective you don't have to apply to much of this cream and judt do a regular regimen when it comes to it and you'll see results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed the sample. I love how we received a tiny jar of it, so I was able to use it for a couple of weeks, and really got a feel for the product. My skin responded very nicely to the cream, and overall I did see that my fine lines and wrinkles seemed to diminish. For the price, this is definitely a product that I will be purchasing in the future. It is rare that you find effective creams for this price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was my first time using an anti-aging creme. I noticed a slight difference when using the product. I do not feel the need to use an anti-aging cream yet. but I told my mom about it and she went out and bought it and uses it daily. she says it is great for her skin, doesn't leaver her skin feeling oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's hard to give a solid review because I just started using it. I like the fact that product is light weight and the scent is good. This product is not breaking me out and it doesn't appear to be drying my skin out at all. We shall see what happens! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the scent of the product and the way it feels in the skin. Ice used it for about two weeks and haven't noticed too much of s difference. I have noticed a tad bit more firmness but I think with prolonged use I would see better results. I will buy s full size jar and hope to see more drastic results.

"I haven't used Ponds in ages. I tried it once way back when because my grandma and mom swore by it lol. Trying this sample made me a believer again in the brand. It is making my skin soft and smooth, and even reducing some of my wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product and unfortunate I broke out in hives but I have extremely sensitive skin so I don't think it was anything negative concerning the product. I have tried other points products and they worked amazingly so I will absolutely recomend this product to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Even though this product didn't work for me, my mom like it so I will be buying her one in the near future. Plus, it's cheaper than Olay, her trusted drugstore cream. I have oily/combo skin with eczema on my body. My mom has dry skin, nonsensitive. For me, it clogged my pores but it worked fine for my mom but we both didn't noticed any difference. Maybe with longer wear time,we will. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't find this product to be very special. I think the packaging will make it difficult to reach the bottom of the container. I felt that the smell was a little too strong. It feels nice on my skin, but I don't really notice a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I personally don't need Anti-aging products. But I thought I would give this a chance just because I thought it would provide good moisture. When I put it on it was so drying to my skin I couldn't believe this was for wrinkles. Maybe someone's body chemistry will react better than mine but for me it was a no. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's always difficult to tell if the ""anti-aging"" claims are valid, because you can't look into the future to know if/what worked. But, this cream does leave my skin feeling soft and supple which I like. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had heard of this product but hadn't tried it. I really liked it! I loved the slight scent and creamy application. I have used it every night since I got it and have felt that my skin looks better! When my sample runs out, I plan on buying more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall I was pleased with this product. But, like with most opportunities to try samples, the samples are too small to really give an honest review. I was able to use for a few days and was please during that time! Would like to try it for a longer period to really get to see some long term advantage of using this product over others out there.

"I tried Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream and it wasn't greasy or thick. It was light and easy to apply. I tried it for several days and felt younger and prettier. I haven't had to purchase it since the sample was enough for a month, but I intend to purchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is okay for occasional use, but I wouldn't purchase it and use it daily. It felt heavier than the product I currently use (Clinique moisturizing gel). It also made my skin feel more sticky and oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm looking forward to using this product long term. So far it has been fairly nice as a skin cream, but I haven't used it long enough to be able to comment on it's anti-aging claims. Scent and texture are wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin feels great after using this cream, but I am unsure if it does what it is supposed to. Do I would need to use this product for a long time in order towhat it does in terms of preventing agung.aging. In reality though I guess I would never know because I don't know how muchumuch you skin would age without it. I guess I would just have to have a whole lot of faith in a brand and the science behind it to know if this sstuff works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really wanted to enjoy this but I can't. The first day I used this product, the next day i woke up with acne. I've never had a problem with acne and I do not have sensitive skin. I tried again and again, every time more acne. I guess that's the ""youthful appearance"" it's supposed to give you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This face cream feels great on my skin. I'm not sure that I've noticed a difference in any wrinkles yet, but I have pretty young-looking skin to begin with. The only downside is that the fragrance is rather strong, but I quickly got used to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am so happy I was able to get a sample to try. I loved it the first time I put it on. It smells great and has a very nice feel and consistency. It absorbs into my skin and leaves it feeling soft and not greasy. I used it on my neck and it looks smoother and less crepey. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"The minute I opened the bottle this product had such an amazing smell. I don't usually like facial products with heavy perfume as they have a tendency to break me out. However, this product was moisturizing as well as light weight. It penetrated my skin throughout and left me with a clean beautiful feel! A product I would definitely put in my rotation.

The amount provided in the sample is what I am most happy with. it gives me enough to really try the product out. the product has no smell to it. it goes on smooth. it is not oily.

"I'm really not at an age where I'm showing any sort of wrinkles or need anti-aging cream. However, I've heard on numerous occasions you should start early. I used this cream as a night time moisturizer and it was very nice. There wasn't any visible lifting of skin, but I didn't expect any either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product seemed great and I loved the consistency because It was thick but not oily. Unfourtanetly I had an allergic reaction to it but I have very sensitive skin. I am sure that not everyone would have the reaction I had. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"The texture is amazing and makes my skin feel so hydrated. I also really like the smell. I have not used this long enough to know if it actually provides wrinkle reduction benefits, but I will consider buying a full size product when my sample runs out.

"Wonderful smell and great moisturizer. Not greasy at all and feels really smooth on my face. I can't comment on the effectiveness for wrinkles since I am using it more as a preventative measure, but I love it as a general moisturizer in its own right.

"I've been ""almost 40"" for a couple years now, and I guess it's an appropriate time to try this product. My skin is naturally kind of oily, but this didn't make it any worse. I'm not sure if I've seen any noticeable difference yet, but I'll keep using it just in case. Somebody else might notice what I don't! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When your approaching 30 and notice you have a permanent crease on your forehead you realize its time to start some prevention. I liked this and will be making a switch. it wasn't greasy and didn't have a foul smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this facial cream. I have to be honest, this is not a brand I would have normally chosen at the store, so I am SO glad that I was given this free sample. I am in love !! I felt a difference in a few days. It's not too heavy, not too greasy and doesn't make me break out (like other creams have). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My grandma used to use cold cream every night and her skin was beautiful. I was concerned that the smell would be too much for me but I found it pleasant. I can't confirm whether or not it is anti aging but I enjoyed the product very much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Like many, I had tried almost every product out there for skin concerns. Nothing great about them so I was always a bit disappointed. This product from Ponds is both nicely priced plus it actually is working nicely to ease my lines and improve my skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin feels so soft after I use this. I love the smell and my face does not feel greasy. I only use once a day though so I don't break out and so far so good. Will be finally starting my skin regimen at the age of 33. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I think of Ponds as a trusted brand that my mother and grandmothers al used (that cold cream!) , so I was quite enthusiastic about trying the Rejuveness with expectations of the brand being modernized. I used the sample for about 10 days, but saw no visible improvements to my skin, and it actually felt a bit greasy and itchy. No reaction or redness, just not a clean heathy skin feeling.

"I was shocked to see how big this sample was! This jar seems like it'll last a while. I like the packaging, consistency of the cream, and how it absorbs fast into the skin. It doesn't leave an oily residue or break me out. I've noticed that my skin looks more supple and healthier. I just wish this was a little cheaper to buy because I would go out and buy some!

"This was my first time using ponds rejuveness anti aging cream. I have been using it for a few days and I like it, it leaves my face feeling moist. I don't know abut the wrinkles, it's too early for my to say , but overalI i enjoy the product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really have enjoyed using the Ponds Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream, especially on my neck and chest area because it leaves it feeling soft and moisturized. It has never felt like something heavy, or a film sitting on top of my skin, like others have in the past. However, I do with it had a little more ingredients in it, such as hyalauronic acid or glycolic acid. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream scent was intolerable for me. I am very sensitive to scent and I could not stand the fragrance once I applied this product to my face. I immediately had to wash my face to remove this product. I was not able to review if this product works or not as I could not use this product for any extended period of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got a sample of this to try out and see if I liked it or not & I really did so I went out and got the larger size. It started working rather quickly because my lines weren't that deep. I was able to catch them rather quickly, so I shared some with a friend who has deep wrinkles and she's notching a change after using it a couple weeks. I'm going to continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like how it smelled & how it made my skin feel. As far as wrinkle repair, I'm not sure, as I do not have wrinkles quite yet. I will probably continue to purchase & use this product. If I continue to not have wrinkles, I'll know why! ;) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very dry skin in my t zone, this was very hydrating and has a very light fragrance that isn't overpowering. it leaves my face hydrated all day.

"I currently use a product that I love and that is amazing. However, I did use this sample for a week and was pleased.

"I received this product two weeks ago and waited until now to write a review, since the product claims that it ""visibly reduces wrinkles in 2 weeks."" I was diligent in following the product instructions and applied to my neck and face every morning and evening over a two week period. I see no change whatsoever. Just another anti-wrinkle cream that doesn't deliver on the promise. Don't waste your money. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way that this cream smells and I also loved that it made my face extremely soft. The one thing I did not like and would prohibit me from purchasing or using again is that it made my face my face breakout all over. I do not have acne when I use natural products but this product is MUCH too harsh for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i received a previous sample and used it all . i was so happy to receive this in my pinchme box! i dont only use it on my face and neck , i use it all over. its not greasy and feels wonderful . not sure if it works on wrnkles but i will keep using it.

"I have tried other products, but really like this one. The product is very smooth and easy to apply. I don't feel like it left my skin feeling greasy, but instead feeling soft and smooth.

I live this product so much!!! Since I started using it I have noticed a difference in my skin. My pores have shrunk and some fine wrinkles are less noticeable! I highly reccomend this product and will definitely continue to use it!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My wife has been using the cream at night and has found that it leaves her skin fresh with a nice soothing feeling.

"I really liked the smell and texture of this product. It went on nicely and didn't leave my face feeling greasy. The first two times I used the product I didn't have any issues. On the third day I noticed that my skin was starting to break out. I do have sensitive skin, but I have found products that work well with my skin and don't cause breakouts. This product sadly is not one of them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have a face cream that I received from my dermatologist that works as an anti-aging that does not cause a reaction on my sensitive skin. I was very pleased with the Ponds Anti-Aging because it is one of very few products that I was able to use without breaking out in a rash. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is one of the best anti aging creams on the market today in my opinion. It does exactly what it is intended to do. It left my face with visibly less wrinkles and the crows feet were almost non existent after using this great product from Ponds. I will be buying this as soon as my sample runs out!!

"After only one use, I could tell that the skin on my face felt tighter and softer too. Even though I'm only 20 and haven't had a problem with wrinkles, I feel that it is always good to start early.

"I have never used any anti-aging cream before receiving the free sample jar of Pond's Rejuveness anti-aging cream. I was pretty skeptical that I would see any difference after using the cream, I have been using the Pond's Rejuveness Anti-aging cream for a week now and already I see a difference in my skin tone. Before my skin was looking old and dried out and now I am beginning to see more of a youthful glow. The cream is non -greasy and has a light scent. I love it!

"I remember my mother using Pond's Cold Cream when I was a young girl. I looked forward to trying this sample of Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream. It was light, but provided good coverage.

"The package says results in 2 weeks, but I noticed a difference in fine lines around my eyes after just a week of using it at night. It's a little greasy for me, which is why I only use at night.

I received this product from Pinch me. I currently do not need an anti-aging cream since I have yet to develop wrinkles. But I did want to try this product out. The smell reminded me of my grandmother and the consistency was creamy so it was too bad. I just didn't want my product that was suppose to make me feel like I am not going to get old to remind me of my grandmother. The smell isn't bad it is a good smell. It is just my preference.

"I got this product to test for free courtesy of Pond's & PinchMe. I've been using it for a week, only at bed time as a preventive method. I like that it is not greasy.

"The product has a nice fragrance, but it lasts for hours. I prefer to be able to smell my perfume, not moisturizer most of the day. I also had a little bit of a break out after using the product, so I discontinued use. Not sure how well it works for reducing wrinkles/age marks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I don't feel that I can give an accurate review due to the length of time using the product. However, I can say that this product does not leave my face feeling oily like other face lotion.

I have never used an anti-aging cream. I loved this product because it was light and refreshing. I have been using the sample every day when I get out of the shower.

"This may be a good product, but I can't use it. I am a migraine sufferer and very sensitive to smells. I tried to use this for 3 days and I just couldn't continue. The perfume aroma was just too overwhelming to my senses. I know it would take more than three days of use to see results and I did not see any change in the few days I used it.

As soon as I opened the container I was a little put off by the scent. Not unpleasant just...I have allergies and can be really sensitive to fragrance. I put this on my neck to make sure I wouldn't have any problems and I was washing it off less than 15 mins later when my eyes started to burn. It is thicker and heavier than my Aveeno Absolutely Ageless and does not smell nearly as nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really loved the Ponds anti-aging cream. I felt like I was using a much more expensive brand given its texture and feel (very rich and smooth). I loved the way my face felt after using the cream and I felt as though I had rrally pampered myself. Way to go Ponds! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've never actually used an anti-aging product before this one. I don't really have any wrinkles so I can't say if it really helps with that. It is great at moisturizing the skin and I do think my skin looks great after I use it. I'll definitely continue using this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Definitely moisturized my skin and improved the areas where I have fine lines. A little goes a long way. Lightly scented, not overpowering. Nice velvety texture and soaks into skin quickly. I like that this does not have SPF, I like to put that on separately when I need it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have patchy, dry, red skin. This stuff is exactly what I need! I've spent so much mone on products that did not quench my dry skin at all, and this product is so much better than all of those. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Product was better than i expected, smells nice, goes on smooth, not greasy leaves skin feeling moisturized, works well under makeup, skin looks better after just a few uses, will recomend it to my friends [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the product, and after two weeks, my skin looked and felt smoother. The texture is thick and creamy, so I'd probably use this more in the winter time. It's too heavy for summer. One thing I'd change about the product is the scent. It reminds me of my grandma's beauty products--definitely outdated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At this time, I have noticed no difference after using this cream. Maybe I still have to continue to use it, but it didn't have an immediate effect. At this time, I wouldn't purchase. Maybe if I received another sample that was bigger, I would try it again to better judge the effectiveness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used several products similar to this before, and I have to say that this one stacks up really well. It hasn't been long but I can already see a difference in my skin. I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I personally do not have wrinkles or fine lines but when using this product my skin felt firmer and tighter. The smell wasn't strong but smelled vaguely like baby wipes. I would not recommend using this product during the day time because it is on the thicker side. However, overall a pretty good product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I usually use Avon products, which I still like, but this didn't sting my skin in the real dry spots like some of the other products I've tried. I felt moisturized and my skin felt soft and smooth within a couple hours. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cream had a very tacky feel when applied and could not where anything over it during the daytime. I don't know about the benefits but I definitely did not like the feel or the scent of the product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ponds always has amazing products but I had never heard of this one. I am so pleased I got it to try. It beyond excels what I thought it would. A pleasant light scent and lovely texture, plus is smooths my skin so well and I wake up looking refreshed and bright skinned. Absolutely will be purchasing when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the sample size! I was able to try for a week and my skin feels softer and smoother. The best part about this product is after you apply to your face it dries completly other products I've tried leave my face greesy and oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A long time ago I used Ponds facial cream and it felt like grease just sat on the exterior of my face. Well now I got the same result and don't feel this product can actually tighten the skin to reduce wrinkles. Thank you for the generous chance to try your product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I don't always love the scent of face creams. This one was okay. But I did like the way my skin felt in the morning. Very smooth and hydrated. Maybe a little too heavy for me in the summer but definitely will use in winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't currently have any wrinkles so I can't tell if the product is working or not. It smells a little like baby powder or baby lotion, but gets better after you have applied it to your face. It is not thick or greasy feeling, so I like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Well I could not get past the smell of the product. It reminded me of cold cream from years ago. It is a lightweight cream, a little greasy feeling, that went on smoothly and absorbed well into the skin. Did not notice much difference in my skin texture after a week of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried various anti- aging creams including high end ones and was surprised to find a lower priced product that works as well. Rejuveness anti-aging cream gave my skin a smoother appearance and fine lines were less noticeable after about two weeks. Highly recommend this cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have wrinkles on my forehead and around my mouth and eyes, but instead of firming the skin, I just broke out everywhere. I followed the directions by cleaning my fave before applying and used it twice a day. I will not be looking for this on shelves. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Not that I have a ton of wrinkles at my age, but I feel this is an amazing product. There is no stickiness or feeling like there's a ton of product on your face. It's smooth and makes my skin feel great and look good too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My wife has begun using this product each night. She says that it goes on smooth and has made her skin feel soft. It may be a bit too early to tell just how well it will do on ant wrinkles but it is moisturizing her skin at this time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ok so I've been using this product for a coiple weeks now and have not seen immediate results. I enjoy products that show dast results. It makes them more appealing to me to try out and use. I Will keep using this product to see if I can notice any changes in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Now nothing is an instant fix so never expect an overnight change! I'm very realistic when it comes to skin care and very serious about it too, because who wants to look older than they have to? I really like Pond's Anti-Aging cream because it really smooths and moisturizes your skin well. I've already skin improvement in the texture of my skin and the lines on my forehead (which is basically the only place I have them so far) after only a week. I'm very satisfied with those results!

"I just turned 41 and have not tried many anti wrinkle products. This product made my skin feel dewy and it kept it moisturized all day. I don't really have wrinkles, but I am hopeful that it will prevent them! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this cream. It has a nice, light texture that doesn't take too long to dry and doesn't irritate my sensitive, acne-prone skin. It also has a very nostalgic scent... I can't seem to place it, but I like it and have caught myself opening up the jar just to enjoy the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have to admit, I don't use anti-aging stuff, and the label on this one about being out in the sun after applying it made me leary of even using it. But I did, and I don't know how much difference I saw in my skin, but it helped my skin feel softer and more hydrated than without it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ponds Rejuvuness Anti-Aging Cream is an all around good facial cream for someone like me. I have sensitive skin and really dislike the heavy feeling of most creams. Ponds was not like that at all, it was light and the scent was soft. My face felt smooth and I think it has shown the benefits of less noticible wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm using this Ponds product daily & I'm loving the results! My skin feels silky smooth and the I love that it's mildly scented. I will definitely purchase this product once my generous sample is used up. Thanks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am 39 but I still have acne-prone skin. During the summer my skin is on the oily side. At first I was enjoying the the immediate results such as the cream dries matte and does not cause oil breakthrough. Then a few days later I started breaking out. I had to stop using it. I can't say what it does for wrinkles because it caused an acne breakout on my skin making useless for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Smells very much like you'd expect a ""cold cream"" to smell, which I don't like. Rich formula feels good and soaks in really well. I can't speak for the effectiveness of the cream because I've only used it 4 or 5 times. It did cause an initial breakout. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used it, and I like the smooth feeling of the cream and how it didn't irritate my sensitive skin. That puts it above other products, but I don't know where to find this if I did want to buy it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have more than enough sample to be able to test it out and boy this stuff works! It left my skin feeling silky smooth. I just bought my full size cream today. So I thank you for allowing me to fully test this out and thank you for a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Unfortunately I suffered a severe allergic reaction to the cream and immediately broke out in hives. I did like how smooth is was when I applied it and the scent, but I can't really provide an accurate review due to the reaction I had. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved how this didn't feel greasy on my face and had an amazing scent. But after about a week of using this I broke out in tiny little bumps on my cheeks. Since I've stopped using this they went away. I would still recommend this to friends & family but unfortunately I have sensitive, acne-prone skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Great cream with a nice scent. Although there wasn't enough to see any long-term benefits, this product did not irritate my sensitive acne-prone skin which is a HUGE plus! I would definitely consider buying more once I use up the other products I have stockpiled. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really wanted to like this. I used it, and it went on smooth and smelled great and kept me moisturized, but I started to break out after using it for a week and unfortunately cannot keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream worked well and smells nice. It doesn't feel to heavy or thick on my face, but it also doesn't feel thin/watery and leave me desiring more moisture. I am currently finishing a few other face creams, so I'm not currently in the market to buy more. When I run out, I will consider this product, particularly because I'm sure it is cheaper than what I'm using currently. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really love this product. It feels great on my skin; and I was able to see the results quickly. Unfortunately, I consider this a luxury product; and it isn't in my budget to buy such things. However, I would recommend it. It is an excellent product for the price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the Pond's family of products and yes I have tried the store knock offs plus others! I love the regular Ponds facial cream for pretreat before I put on makeup. This product is excellent for night time repair and moisture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the Ponds Rejuveness Anti Aging Cream for about two weeks as stated on package. Results were supposed to be visible in that time, however, I did not not notice anything at all in the condition of my skin. It had a nice light texture, but felt a bit heavy on my face. It reminded me of the old Ponds Cold Cream. I was disappointed in the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just got this free sample for my honest review and I have only used it for a week so I can't really say yet about long term results but I like it it feels nice goes on smooth and I think I am already noticing some results I'll keep using it it's never to early to start using antiaging products.

"POND'S Rejuveness ANTI-AGING CREAM have an esplendid fragances, as baby powder. It is a light cream that absorbs quickly. It's not feel greasy or sricky. After several days, I noticed that my face looks brighter, younger and smoother. I do not have wrinkles and I think this cream will take a long time to leave. The use twice a day as part of daily beauty routine. Definitely, I will buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this Anti-Wrinkle Cream by Pond's. It has a wonderful fragrance and is not greasy at all. It feels very light and absorbs into the skin quickly. My skin feels so soft and refreshed after applying it. A little goes a long way. I have used the sample jar (1.75oz) I received on my face every day for two weeks now and still have almost half of a jar left. I would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was not a big fan of the ponds antiage cream. It's not necessarily the product itself. It may just be one of their ingrediants in it that my skin/body doesn't like. My face got real red and hot after using it. So this specific product doesnt work for me. I would recommend it,its not a bad product at all, just not meant for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream works GREAT! I was able to see results in just a few days after use. I was very surprised by how quickly it started working and that it didn't upset my skin. I would recommend this cream to anyone looking for quick results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream left my skin feeling moisturized and firm. After continued use of the product, I noticed that the fine lines on my forehead and neck were slightly less noticeable. The only thing that took some getting used to was the smell, I didn't really like it at first. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's an amazing product if you actually need it. It's too expensive for my tastes, especially since I am younger and don't necessarily need it. Although when I do decide that I should start using products like this, this would be my first go to product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is good for daily use; it's affordable, does the job. However, being that I'm younger, I don't have as many serious wrinkles in comparison to those that are 50+. I haven't seen this make a big different in older consumers in my circle of friends. However, for prevention purposes, this is a good product for those in their 20s and 30s. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cream was moisturizing but not greasy. It did not make my skin breakout which can be an issue. I likes that the sample had enough product in it to actually be able to review it well. I would buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I opened the container (which was a nice size sample), I noticed the soft scent. Some scents make me sneeze, not this one. The cream is thick, goes on smooth and doesn't feel heavy on your face; a little goes a long way. I've been using the product for aprox 1 week and haven't noticed a big difference yet. I would recommend this product."

"pond's is actually great products. it is affordable and it is effective. The only thing I did not like was the scent. it has fragrance scent. I am natural person, so I did not like it when I go to bed. Also, I liked the sample size. it is nice container because it does not leak while i was traveling.

"I am very sensitive to smells, if it smells off in the least I will never use the product again no matter how well it works. I will need more time to see if this is effective for anti aging but it sure does smell great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was already a fan of the regular Pond's moisturizing creams but knowing this has anti aging in it made me like it more. It had a great scent and didn't leave an oily or sticky feeling. Skin feels smooth in the morning. I wouldnt recommend wearing it through the day. I havent tested it out long enough to see if the anti aging is working but will definitely keep using it.

My skin responded so well to this product! I've already noticed my skin looks clearer and more even. Fine lines are starting to fade away!

i have extremely dry skin and when trying new products i have to be careful. this keeps my skin hydrated (i use 2x a day) i just wish the packaging was different. i feel like i am using too much but not on purpose. this would be much better with a pump or as a squeeze bottle.

"Now that i am getting older and living in a hot and dry climate. I need a face cream that will help with my face type. I do not want to look old before my time. I still want to look young. Living in the Desert southwest has a way of making folks look years older than there real age. So, that's why i love Pond's it is great for the face and makes your face look younger and revive. It is also great on my budget. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like how the cream is thick but not greasy and absorbs well into the skin. The scent is nice too. Feels luxurious and moisturizes well. I only have one issue with this product...it burns and irritated my skin where I have some acne...try to keep it off those sense time areas of your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have sensitive skin and can't use many products even though they would work on many others. When I opened this and found out it had a fragrance to it I got nervous. Surprisingly it didn't irritate me instantly thankfully for the directions on the packaging. Within days I saw minor results and the longer I used the more results I saw.

"ok, big surprise here, I always thought of Ponds as a great brand for taking off makeup, I had no idea they had a product for anti-aging....and it is a really nice product, not too thick, didn't feel greasy. Really nice feel on the face and enough to try several nights in a row to evaluate continued use. This one is a keeper and I will be switching. Thank you!

My grandmother used Pond's and I feel it s a trusted brand. This moisturizer had nice slip and felt nice on my skin. There was a slight mask like feel but that does not bother me too much. I have used better and i have used worse. I may buy this depending on price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I didn't have high expectations when I received sample but I was pleasantly surprised. It's super thick and absorbent. I left my area around my eyes soft and I really liked how it felt. I also liked that it didn't have a strong scent to it. I will keep using. I was happy with it and I can't wait to see how my skin will look after a few more weeks, but I can tell I will be really happy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I did enjoy how this product went onto my skin, however it left my face feeling so greasy and weighed down. I don't wear face make up so I'm not used to this feeling, and I did not like it. It didn't feel like it absorbed into my skin at all, and more like it was a protective barrier on my face. I don't know if people who typically wear face make-up will like this, but I did not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was excited to try this product. I have sensitive skin and this product didn't agree with my skin. I had put it around my eyes where wrinkles are starting and almost immediately my eyes were burning. I had also put it around my lips and also had a bad reaction. I'll have to keep on looking for a nice product for my sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used to use ponds years ago and switched to Olay, then to Loreal. After trying the Ponds again for the 1st time in years, I have to say I am impressed with the way my skin feels after such a short time of using it. I liked it so much that I now have switched back to Pond's ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was delighted to get this. It has an awesome consistency, and smooths skin nicely. I liked the non-greasiness, and the fact that it is not oily. I will use this product, and try to find another Ponds product that might have less of a flowery smell. Maybe it was just me at the time I used it, the scent diminished so I will not let that bother me. Ponds is a trusted brand for me, my Mom used it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed that it felt thick while putting it on but once absorbed my face felt hydrated. The scent isn't too bad but if you are sensitive to scents you may want to smell before buying. I used it in the evening before bed and when I woke up in the morning my skin felt moisturized and brighter. Just for reference, I do not have sensitive skin and I am pretty well balanced with an occasional (maybe one a year or less) hormonal blemish. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Was excited to try this Sample, especially since it claims to help reduce fine lines and wrinkles in 2 weeks. Smells really, really good and doesn't make my face greasy, but when I sweat after applying, makes my face feel like it has a film on it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I typically use Mary Kay skin care products. It was nice to be able to try Pond's. I've always been curious about their products. With my sensitive skin I was pleased that it didn't break me out. The scent however was a little strong for me. I don't like strong scents on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was skeptical at first when I received this product because I had not heard of it but I have been using it for a week now and love it! It is light and creamy and does not have a greasy feel. It makes my makeup go on a lot smoother. It makes my skin feel soft and rejuvenated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ponds has been around for generations. It is still an amazing product that you can use and trust. I like using this at night because it seems to work well. It doesn't interfere with makeup application the next morning either. I will buy this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like how lightweight the product is and it doesn't clog my pores. I have very oily skin, so it's difficult to find a face cream that doesn't make me more oily. So far, I really like this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is affordable compared to mose high end creams at reducing wrinkles and fine lines. I would definitely recomend this product as it felt lightweight and airy on my skin. I did see a significant difference with the appearance of my lines around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked how this cream felt and how well it soaked into my skin with out the greasy feel. However, the scent was a bit strong for my liking and I was still noticing it several hours after application. I'm not a big scent person, so for me that was a negative; but over all if that doesn't bother you, try this! It truly was a lovely moisturizer otherwise.

"I am very big on face cream and use it about 3 times a day. This cream is amazing, it doesn't make my face feel greasy and it hydrates my skin beautifully. I have eczema and I am not able to use a lot of things on my face. After 2 uses I could see that it had a positive effect on my eczema and didn't make it flare up. It is also great under makeup and I think it helps my makeup appear more flawless. I absolutely fell in love with this cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"the cream is so light weight that it feels like there is nothing on my face, plus it is super moisturizing as well. the sample size was huge and will last a long time. it only takes a tiny dab of the product to cover your whole face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I like ponds products in general. Unfortunately, when I think of buying an anti-aging product I don't usually think of getting ponds brand. This is because ponds is a general product. I feel like if there was a wider variety of choices I would reconsider my overall choice and probably buy a ponds product more often. Although I think the brand is outdated it still does what it aims to do. IT WORKS! (: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cream seemed to work well but I couldn't used it for long enough to figure out for sure. Due to the overwhelming perfume scent which gave me a headache. If the scent was changed I would be much more open to using this product frequently. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I REALLY LIKED THIS PRODUCT. The first time I used this product I immediately felt my fave fighting but not in a bad way in a good firming way liwas working. It wasn't too greasy but was moisturizing. I tried this for 2 weeks just like the package said I would see results and I believe I did. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was moisturizing I however prefer thicker creams for my face. The consistency is what I would like for a sunscreen not a moisturizer. The product did glide well. I am currently using it and I might grow fonder of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love how it feel so light and smooth on my skin, if the product is heavy my pores seal and make me sweat. Pond is the first one I have found that does have to be bought at a high end makeup counter. I also like that the Ponds has been around for a long time but it is keeping up with the times and keeping prices so the average women can afford that why they will always be around my generation to come.

"I can't say that I noticed a large difference when using this product. It wasn't. Ad, but it wasn't amazing. It's a safe, adequate product. I will say, however, that it didn't break out my VERY sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this nightly after cleansed skin. It absorbs very well and moisturizes my face. I did start to see more of a plump and softness to my face after regular use. I like that this cream did not block my pores or cause breakouts. I also like that my skin looks exfoliated and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I opened the jar and was pleased there was no perfume smell. Nothing but clean natural scent. I put this on every night since I received it, and I have noticed a huge difference in my skin. The lines have smoothed out, and I don't have the dry patches in areas anymore. It's hard to believe this is actually a product that would do anything because of how clean and light it is, but I can tell you don't let this fool you. Great product!!

I absolutely love this product! I've been searching for a face cream that works well under my makeup and that doesn't ball up. Or that makes me look cake and this is the one! I so love this Ponds face cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have only been using the product for about a week but have noticed my face is beginning to smooth out a little bit. At first the product feels like it is going to be slightly oily/greasy, but it quickly absorbs into the skin and leaves no residue on skin. I have really enjoyed using this product, but was a bit hesitant at first because my skin is highly sensitive. It works really well on its own, but with my makeup I seem to get small flareups. Perhaps this would be a good product to apply at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the thought of anti aging. I am not convinced that one product can achieve that. I did like the texture and smooth feel of this product. The scent was a bit stronger that I usually go for . Thanks for the opportunity of trying this lovely anti-wrinkle cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Like the way the Pond cream makes my skin feel without the greasy feeling you get with other similar products. Use to have to worry about clogging my pores even when the product would say it wouldn't do that. No problem with the pond cream...only the benefits promised.

"Like they all say, better late than never. Starting early using anti-aging products is a must in today's society. The hot weather affects our skin and most importantly it plays a role in aging.

"My grandmother has always used Pond's but I never had until I got this sample. Its a great modern move for Ponds! It was easy to rub on and absorbed very quickly. It did not make my skin greasy, just moisturized. My face feels smoother and looks less tired. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the scent and texture of the product. I enjoyed using it and will continue to use for a few days to see how I like it and if I will replace what I am currently using. When given a sample it is not always easy to get the best judgement of it unless there is enough to last at least a week. This one should and I plan to use and buy if I see any results after a week. I have heard and used Ponds brand before. It is reasonably priced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved this cream! It is really smooth and went on the skin very easily. It has a very silky feel and absorbed quickly. It made me skin look better in a short period of time. The sample was large enough so you can really give it a try. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My sample of the Ponds Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream feels wonderful going on my skin and it absorbs quickly and leaves a clean fresh fragrance for me to enjoy while it's working!
I can't wait to find it to purchase a full size jar!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to test this product because Pond's has always been a trusted brand and this product doesn't disappoint. Due to my combination skin type, my T-zone is extremely oily. If you have oily skin, this product is best used at night to prevent daytime shine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't really have many wrinkles, maybe some stress marks but I still decided to try this out. Its okay but I just started and haven't really seen any difference but it does make my skin feel good. Again don't really have wrinkles so not sure how effective this will be. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found the Pond's antiaging cream to go on very smoothly. It had a nice scent and did not feel too thick or sticky like some formulas. I haven't noticed any results yet, but will continue to use the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked this product. It went on nicely and did not leave my skin greasy. The only thing I didn't like about it is the smell. It is a little too strong for my liking as I prefer unscented or lightly scented instead. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This left my face feeling light, fresh and smooth. I love that it wont clog pores! The scent is light and one that I love. It reminds me of a light baby lotion scent. I have really dry skin and this helped so much and moisturized it so it doesn't look dry anymore. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought the product was alright, though it didn't work for me. I have very oily skin so this made me break out a bit and sat pretty heavily on my eyes, not something I prefer, even though it did moisturize the area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'M KIND OF DISILLUSIONED WHEN IT COMES TO WRINKLE REMOVERS, & /OR LINE ERASERS,OR SHRINKING PORES. I'M CONVINCED THEY'RE ALL JUST MOISTURIZERS. THERE ARE NO MAGICAL PRODUCTS THAT WILL REMOVE & / OR ERASE THE SIGNS OF AGING [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I never would of thought of purchasing Ponds Anti aging cream. I guess for some stupid reason since its been around forever I always thought of it as a cheap brand. What a Suprised it was for me. I tried it never thinking I would like it, however after a few days I began to see the results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ponds has really changed my mind about there brand. The cream was very moisturizing without being greasy or heavy on the skin, and the scent was very mild and pleasant! This item is very affordable! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not really seeing many results in the anti-wrinkle department, but then I don't think this product specifically would be for me. (It might work for someone else with a different skincare regimen.) Most of my anti-aging concerns are addressed in the actives portion of my skincare routine, and while I could very well include an anti-aging occlusive (which is where this would fall), I find that there are other creams I prefer over this one specifically. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream smells so fresh and clean, not too fragrent at all! It makes my skin so soft and smooth and I use it as a hand cream and also on my neck and chest to prevent wrinkles. I only use on the under eye area not my whole face. Love this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A really appreciated the sample size, as it was sufficient enough to use the product for more than just a day or two. While it doesn't seem to be an intense reduction in fine lines, I like the texture of the cream-moisturizing but not oily and you can feel the tingle when you first apply so you can tell the AHAs are working. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer truly delivers what it claims to do. It works great for my combination skin without leaving it greasy. A little goes a long way. My skin feels moisturized, hydrated, soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the sample as well as purchased a larger container in order to continue use. I cannot say what the final result is, because I am still waiting to see results of something other than just my usual face lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for about a week and haven't noticed any difference yet, but it does say it takes 2 weeks. It has a nice consistency and doesn't hurt my skin at all. I will continue using this because it feels very moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love Ponds! My grandmother used it all her life- of course Cold Cream. So Ponds has been a favorite in our house. I think the product is creamy and smells great. I noticed after two days that the product made my face smoother , now I would need to finish the product to see if it deminshes my fine lines around my eyes and forehead. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My Mom used the Pond's brand when I was a little girl. She trusted it then and I trust it now. This is a very good skin cream. Not oily or heavy. Really reduces the appearance of lines and wrinkles! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love, love this wonder cream. It has made a huge difference in my skin. My face looks fresh, smooth, lines almost gone. Family and friends have asked what am I using because I look wonderful. So yes Ponds is amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product had a kind of thick texture and if it got in any hair, including eyebrows, it would become flaky white bits that would be really hard to get out and I would find it all day long. I do not normally have flaky hair. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used lots of different anti-aging creams, and this one smells great, but I didn't notice any visible results. It feels light and smooth on my skin - but really didn't see any difference in my fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ponds has always been my favorite brand for facial products so I was glad to find that the anti aging product stood up to the rest of their products. Wonderful scent and non greasy texture like I've come to expect from Ponds. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I gave your Ponds face cream a try, it brought back memories of my mom using it every day. Now I see why! It has a great feel on my face and leaves my face feeling clean, but not dry and tight. I love the feel! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've enjoyed trying this product I am excited to see the results Ina few weeks. It doesn't have a powerful smell and not heavy like other creams it's light and doesn't burn or leave my skin red. I would recommend this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed using this product. The cream went on my skin smoothly and made my skin feel soft. The fragrance was pleasant also. As far as anti-aging, I saw a difference in my skin in the softness, and a small change with wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not notice much difference when using this product and when I was using my usual stuff. My face felt soft a d moisturized, but it did it on my old stuff too,so no difference. I did not notice my face looking any younger and when I asked a couple friends opinion, they too did not see any difference. Maybe I would notice a difference if U used it for a long time, but don't think I will spend more money to buy it just to see if it works any better then the less costly that I now buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream! It worked as well as more expensive skin creams but at an affordable price! I have recommended this product to others. Definitely a great product that produces the results you expect from a skin care cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely adore the scent of this. I find myself wanting to slather it everywhere just to get the scent. It's a thicker formula which is best used right before bed in my opinion. A bit too heavy as a daily moisturizer but Ponds never disappoints! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is okay for night time use (provided you don't let your dogs give you goodnight kisses- they find it to be quite tasty. I'm sure it can't be good for them. THen I have to was my face and reapply). I did try the product during the day and my face looked greasy. I guess it you coat your face with make-up it's not an issue. I do not use much make-up and it is a huge issue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't feel I've really had enough time to review the long term effectiveness of this product but it is a good moisturizer. However, I don't like that it recommends you wait at least 15 minutes after washing your face to apply. I'd like to just wash, moisturize and start my make up routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It was a great sample. It made me happy that it came in a decent sized jar as well. Instead of a small packet that is usually a sample. It made me want to support the company more. Also it gave me a real chance to dee how the lotion worked with my skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this is a very good product overall. I use a lot of anti aging and wrinkle creams because it makes my skin so moisturized. This product worked well but there was nothing super great or different about it. Would buy again if the price was right. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked how this cream made my skin feel at first, but the oily cream made my face feel slick and greasy as the evening went on. I woke up with splotchy acne on my cheeks and chin. Overall, I can see how this would be a good moisturizer for someone with dry skin; but it isn't a good product for someone who has an oily face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have never tried any Ponds face cream in the past. It was always something my grandma used years ago. It's been around forever and I never had anything against it, but just went with newer lotions. Not anymore. I LOVE this face cream. It smells amazing and my face feels wonderful since I've started to use it. My skin is glowing and soft. I've used so many different products and never found one I like this much. I should have listened to Grandma! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how easy the product is to apply and that it leaves no residue. The only thing I noticed is that you need to wait 15 to 20 minutes after washing your face to apply the cream on sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I wanted to wait a full week and use this before reviewing it. My face is so broken out from this product that I don't want to take pictures. The scent smells like deodorant, it's very strong, and my face felt oily and heavy during the day with no improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really love the scent and richness of the cream. I live in Florida where it's so hot and humid but also the sun can be very trying on your skin, I really love the way this kept my skin hydrated without feeling oily :-)!!! And I swear it seems like the texture of my skin is getting better and better each time I use this product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this for several nights now, and I really like how it makes my skin feel. My face seems to be smoother, softer and brighter. I don't know that it has helped with any fine lines yet, but I'll keep using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using Ponds cold cream to remove my makeup for years so I was super excited to try this and I love it. The creme is lightweight but moisturizing and leaves my skin feels refreshed and more youthful. It doesn't have an overpowering scent and gives skin a nice glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this stuff! I've previously used the ponds cream (with the blue cap), but this tops it. My skin felt so moisturizer and just an overall amazing feeling. As for anti aging... I'm 23 so don't have too many lines yet,haha, but it's never too early to start. I will be continuing to use this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think ponds is a brand that is not only affordable but also reliable. I didn't see immediate results with this cream but I saw some improvement overtime. I love that I can get this in stores and I don't need to worry about ordering online or breaking the bank. Great product to include in my everyday routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that this is a great product, I have started using it daily around my eyes. I do not have many visible wrinkles yet, but I can feel the quality of this cream. It does tingle a little , but that makes me feel like it is working. No strong smell or chemical smell, it's great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the smooth light texture of the Ponds face cream. I wasn't able to see the true results of the product, because it was a sample size product. I did however like the way my face felt moisturized after using the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i have never used ponds products before because honestly i though it was for older ladies... But since im aging i need to find products that work well with my skin... I used this overnight and in the morning it left my skin so soft and subtle that i am truly amazed at the quality!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When you hit 49 you start to think hey I will be 50 next year and all those little worries about looking older come to mind. With this product I can feel confident that I now look 30!!! Thanks for a great product to help keep me looking YOUNG! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The sample I received was very generous in size, so I was able to use the Pond's rejuveness anti-aging cream for a whole week before bed. I felt that the product felt a little sticky when I first applied it. In the morning my face felt smooth and moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I made the little sample tube last as long as I could by just using a few drops around my eyes each evening for about 10 days. There was definitely a noticeable improvement within only 5 days. My skin felt smoother and silkier and the fine lines around the eye area seemed to be less noticeable as well. Would highly recommend this product ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using it daily as like a moisturizer, and I really am noticing the different it makes! I have fairly dry skin and I think it helps a lot with that. I don't think it'd be very effective for oily skin, although I don't have oily skin so I don't know. I love how it makes my skin feel. I always feel refreshed and my skin feels very hydrated and healthy. It isn't greasy like others. I love how affordable this is! I recommend you give this a try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a nice product that goes on smoothly and isn't too thick or too runny. It seems to be effective and my skin seems to feel softer than before. Not sure about the wrinkles and such as I haven't used the product long enough to see that kind of a result but so far so good [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked that the Ponds went on smoothly,no greasy feel and nothing rubbing off on my pillow. My skin feels hydrated,smooth and soft after using it. It is a little early to tell if it will eliminate wrinkles or even fine lines but so far I am enjoying using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this for about a week, but I think this needs more continuous use to know the true results. It works good but I think would be better suited for fall and winter when the air is dryer- I'll be revisiting then! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the creaminess of Ponds but I have only used this product a couple of times since receiving sample....I need to use it a little longer to see a real improvement but I am happy with it so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am not really interested in anti-aging products, and don't intend to try to hold onto my youth as I mature. But as a nearly 30-year old mother who isn't looking to rid my skin of wrinkles, this was a lovely moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Pond's is one of those brands that inspire confidence, and this product reminded me why. It made my skin look brighter, softer, younger... instantly! After trying the sample, I went right to the store to purchase a full size, and I continue to be impressed with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just started using ponds for about a week now and I absolutely love it. I used to get mad when I got carded at the store for alcohol, but not any more I'm told I look 18 but i am 34. I have converted. Was stuck on olay for years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I honestly thought Ponds wasn't around anymore. Or if it was, it was just making the old-fashioned cold cream of the 70's. The sample was a very nice size that has provided many uses to really see results. I put it on under my regular daily SPF cream as well as the décolletage area. It seems to give my face a little extra oomph and does a nice job filling cracks and making my skin feel very smooth. The scent is nice too! I really enjoyed being reintroduced to Ponds. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've always loved and trusted ponds and was so happy to get to try this product! It smells amazing and isn't greasy- I noticed some results in about a week just my skin being more eve and felt fuller where I used to see creases [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As I'm only 28, I really don't have a need for this type of product yet but since I received a free sample I figured I'd give it a try. Other than giving me a little softer skin, I didn't really notice much difference. It might work really well, I just can't verify that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have spent obscene amounts of money on skin care, creams, cosmetics, you name it- including the overly rated Creme de La Mer just last week. One of the first ingredients is Lactic Acid, which is a skin exfoliant that does a beautiful job at renewing the appearance of skin. I've been using it and my skin is flawless, seriously flawless- no blemishes, less oil, no dryness. That's all I need from a skin cream, will definitely continue to purchase.

"I like the cream overall and it goes on even and smooth, but I knocked a star off due to its scent. It reminds me too much of scented tampons or napkins, LOL. Once you get over that, the product does work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Oh boy! I wasn't expecting to love this product this much! Ponds always remind me of childhood my mom using makeup remover. So I never paid attention to them. I was worried about breakouts before tryout this product also. I was wrong! Never breakout from this cream, very smooth and keep my face mounted and dewy all day and night long! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a great product and I will keep trying it to see if it makes a difference in the next couple of weeks. So far it makes my skin feel better, I haven't seen to much with the wrinkles but it could also take a few uses. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can remember seeing my grandmother's cold cream on her vanity and this is what Ponds Rejuviness reminds me of. Rather than instilling thoughts of youth and rejuvenation, this cream reminded me of the dusty old jar that used to sit on my grandmother's vanity. This cream is greasy and just kind of smears onto your face reminding you why your grandmother never opened the dusty old jar of ponds. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used pond's products on my face years ago and I know my grandmother still uses the products but I was not happy with this one. The cream was extremely thick and it felt heavy on my face. I did not trust that it helped with wrinkles or prevent wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I thought this was an effective product. It went smoothly on and I could feel it tightening my face immediately. However, the scent was way too strong and unpleasant. The scent also lasted a long time, which I did not appreciate. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Apparently everyone in the office used this brand and loves this product. Who knew. This the first time I have head of them but my coworkers assured me their products and cheap, smell good and work well. It's to early to verify the latter claim but one thing I noticed it I didn't have any face irritations which I typically get when I use a face cream with anything related to anti aging. So I look forward to finishing this and seeing the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the Pond's Rejuvenedd Anti-Aging Cream! It is one of the best anti-aging thing I ever used. My normal anti-aging cream that I get from a specialty store. I was skeptical to try this at first. I am so glad I did. I feel the results right away because my skin felt softer and look brighter than it ever has. It absorbed quickly and I was able to put makeup on right away. I am definitely going to continue to use it. I am going to look at the other Ponds products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream contains lactic acid, which makes skin photosensitive, so I have to wear a sunscreen every day while I use this. It wears well under both sunscreen and makeup without causing any issues, like pilling or foundation oxidization. Since I break out easily, I really like that the ingredient list is kept to a minimum, just like Ponds' other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Even though I'm in my 20's I still use Ponds. My mother and may grandmother have always used it and their skin looks great. I'm carrying onthe tradition. It keeps my face hydrated and keeping my youth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I remember my mom using this when I was little. She used it to take off makeup and for her facial 'aging.' I was excited to get it... it didn't remove makeup (though it isn't supposed to,) but it did make my face feel refreshed... it was creamy but no too oily, and the smell is nice! I will be buying your brand in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far I have been using the Pond's cream for a few days and I can already see a difference. It works great with my senstive skin. NO breakouts after using the scream either which is a huge plus. I intendto keep using it and buying buying the product. I have already told a few people about it and reccommend the trying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream feels really nice in the skin and absorbs really well. The only thing that detracts from this product is the scent. It smells like it is more for my grandmother than an under thirty. I don't like it at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product everyone should want, all my wrinkles , their actually fine lines. Around my lower check an mouth, around my eyes and forehead. after about a week Most fine lines are gone."

it will reduces the wrinkle however for me it took more than 2 weeks to notice anything. i wont complain because the results are varied from person to person. however as the most affordable brand on the market it does sit on the face very well. it wont clog the pores and does not feel oily on my skin.

"Before receiving this sample, I had tried Ponds products in the past, and had experienced pleasant results. So when it came in the mail, and was well larger than a ""sample size"", I was very pleased. Although I am young with no wrinkles yet, this makes my skin soft and smooth, and leaves it glowing.

"Gosh I loved this ponds. My Mom always used Ponds at bedtime. I was excited to try it. I do remember her face being all white, hair in rollers. I always wondered how did she keep that stuff on her face all night lol. Well it's not all heavy and thick like it use to be. I know I use to sneak it when I was little lol. Thank you for letting me try it and the memories Pinchme. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"this product didn't really stand out from other similar products, but didn't have any downsides either. the packaging is dated and not in a pump bottle so it feels less sanitary using your fingers to scoop the product out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very sensitive, eczema and acne prone skin (bleh) and anything I use tends to break me out. This product, however, did not. I'm not a huge fan of the scent, though, and personally would prefer something unscented for my face and neck. It lightly moisturizes, and isn't greasy, so big wins in my book. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Lovely product. Goes on smoothly and smells nice and light. Absorbs easily so no greasy feeling afterward. I can't stand a greasy lotion as I already have oily skin and I don't like strong perfumy lotions on my face since you have to smell it once it's on and this one was just nice and light enough to not be bothersome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was a little dissapointed when after the claimed time I saw no real difference, even using the product religiously like it says to. It is non greasy which I like and it also isn't heavily scented so it doesn't hurt my skin. Kind of went in with no expectations, and left feeling disappointed.

"I've always loved Pond's products and this was a generous sample. I put it on at night, before bed, and in the morning, before make up. It leaves my skin feeling refreshingly smooth. I really think the wrinkles appear smoother also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Creams as a free sample. The cream itself is very smooth and goes on well. I used the cream on my neck. Usually when I use products on my neck I have a reaction to them. With this cream I did not. It also has a good smell and does not feel greasy. As for results I think that I would need to use it a little longer to see any results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received my sample last week and I have been using this product everyday and so far love it!!. It is very difficult to find products that don't make my skin turn red and this cream is just great. I am already seeing such a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ponds has made my face look and feel softer, brighter and younger. I love the soft scent and that its from a brand I have seen my grandmother use through the years to help her look younger, so if she can trust Pond's so can I!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a good product overall. It seems gentle on skin, doesn't smell bad, and does seem to moisturize well. My only problem with it is how oily it is. If your skin isn't dry, it may cause acne. Also, especially when the weather is warm like this, it makes my skin feel smothered and overheated. I probably won't use it once the sample runs out for this reason, but many people would not be bothered by this or might even prefer it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used Ponds in the past and really liked it. While using this product, I really liked the way it felt as it was applied. It is nice and creamy. It makes your skin feel soft, noticeably more moisture, and rejuvenated. Very pleased!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ok I have tried almost everything advertised and on the market. This is the very best so far. I makes my face feel soft and works to soften the wrinkles. It is not a cream that professes to make wrinkles less noticeable. It really does soften them.
A friend of mine was visiting a nursing home and asked some of the ladies with nice smooth skin what they used on their face and they all said Ponds. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use Olay anti wrinkle day cream now. It is a lot thicker, hasn't reduced wrinkles and burns sometimes. It also makes my eyes water. I'm upset that I spend a bunch of money on it and don't like it. This is much better, very light, doesn't burn. It also smells wonderful. I don't know about the actual anti wrinkle properties. I'll have to use it for a while to see. So far so good though will be using in place of my old cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
What I look for in any kind of skin cream is if it is greasy and sticky. This product goes on evenly. No greasy or sticky residue. I used it as directed for a week. I only have a few lines to try it on so I used it on the backs of my hands. It left them feeling and looking much smoother. There is no perfume smell either.

"I was excited to try this but in my case I had an allergic reaction and had to was it off about 3 minutes after applying it. I do like the scent and feel, it was non greasy and absorbed quickly. I am going to give it another go in a few days to see if maybe it was just a fluke that I broke out in a rash the 1st time using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just received this product and have just started using it. My initial experience is good. It goes on nicely, it is not overly greasy and provides an immediate feeling of softer skin. Few hours later my face was still soft and moistureized. I have not yet used it under makeup, so I cannot say how it does or does not effect the quality. Also, I have not been using it long enough to see any discernable difference in fine lines/wrinkles. I do have high hopes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It leaves my skin feeling soft and skin is not greasy. I have combination skin and tend to have breakouts over certain brands and this has not caused me a problem. I have not seen a change in my fine lines, but I feel like I may just need more time with this lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like how hydrating this cream is on the skin, sometimes I even use it on my hands when they're a bit dry. Also, this moisturizer has a nice thick consistency. I'm very happy with how a little can go a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Made my skin super soft. However I do not care for the scent. It's too strong. About 20minutes after using my face was soft, but the skin on my hands were tight and felt like they were slightly burning (my face did not experience that sensation).

This is truly a remarkable product. It does just what it says. After one week I visibly saw a difference in my skin. My wrinkles were very faint and I am confident that in another week they will have disappeared [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I haven't used anti aging creams for long. But this one definitely was one of the better ones I've used. Feels smooth, soaks into your skin fast, and doesn't leave an oily film. The smells isn't that typical chemical smell, which I like since it goes in my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It didn't really do to much for wrinkles Ect but then again I haven't been using to long yet, but it has made my skin feel soft and clear which is definitely a plus and thumbs up in my book, this cream is great to use at night. I plan to buy a big jar once my sample is gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am already a huge fan of Pond's skin care. I have been using their facial moisturizers for years. I usually purchase them from Target or Walmart stores. They are reasonably priced. This one in particular is good for anti-aging cream. I apply it nightly after washing my face. The next morning, my face feels nice and tight. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream is amazing, it really hydrates my dry skin and my wrinkles improved. This cream have a great fragrance and scent. It doesn't irritate the skin. I love that this is so affordable and gives great results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Pond's cream didn't break me out, which is always a plus! It was very thick, and I only needed a small amount for my oily skin. Someone with dry skin might need to slather it on a little more. The only downside is the smell, which is stronger than I'd like. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have oily skin. At first I was a bit skeptical about using this product due to my skin type and the fact that the weather is usually hot where I live, making me produce even more oil. I was pleasantly surprised after using this product. I noticed my skin feels fresh, silky and smooth, with no additional oil... and that's a plus! I haven't noticed any change yet with my fine lines, however, I am hopeful they will improve with time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a fantastic product. A little bit of cream goes a long way. I put it on my face, neck and hands before bed and after I cleanse my face in the morning. Wonderful scent and great texture. My skin is moisturized, but not greasy. I started using anti-aging products in my 20s and I find numerous benefits from this product - great moisturizer!

I just started using anti aging cream 3 years ago when I turned 42. Since then I have tried a couple of different brands. This is the first time I have tried Ponds. I didn't think that Ponds was any better or different than the brands I was currently using and it is a little more expensive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am currently pregnant so my skin isn't in the best condition. If I had tried this not pregnant I may have had a better a better reaction. My skin is normally really dry but after putting this product on for about two hours my skin got very oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have always liked Pond's, but this would be the first time I am using their anti- wrinkle cream. I have been only using it a few days now, so I dont see a difference. But, I love that its not greasy at all. I use only a little on my forehead and under my eyes. I do wish it had an SPF in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the Ponds-right when I got it.I could not imagine how great this was.I felt like my skin was soft and looked younger and it felt like it was working for me .I wondered if I might notice fine lines and wrinkles.I thought well I think it works and I will change my anti ageing to this new Ponds.It really does help with a trusted brand name too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was a little skeptical of this but I gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised by how nice it was and how it made my skin look and feel. This performs just as well as more expensive brands. I will be buying in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"thanks for the sample! i use ponds on a pretty regular basis and have never been disappointed by any of the products. each one has its advantages but i prefer the anti-aging creams. also, the scents are very soft and not so over powering as some of the others out there. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's a really good product I must say but I noticed a lil bumps on my forehead so I stopped using it and gave it to a friend. She said it's good and really working for her. That means if it's not good for me doesn't mean it's not good for somebody else. We all have different skin types. But my friend says she really likes it and it's not sticky feeling and it moisturized her face and kept it hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's an alright product, I don't have a problem so much with wrinkles as I do with crepiness and uneven tone so I can't speak to it's anti-wrinkle effects but it did make me break out something fierce and the strong smell scared me because of my sensitive skin.

"Ponds Cream has been around for a very long time and therefore it has had a lot of time to get the product to the top of its game and I think it has done a super job. It leaves my face soft, non-greasy, and not red or shiny. Very gentle on the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have been using Pond's POND'S REJUVENESS ANTI-AGING CREAM for a week now. So far I have not noticed any difference in my fine lines. The product smells nice. It is not so greasy or oily. It gives my skin a smooth look. It hasn't given me any skin breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I opened the jar I could not believe how much was in there and how thick and creamy it was! You only need a little because it spreads out very nicely and it did not leave a shine,it is not greasy feeling and my makeup went on very smooth and even. When this sample is gone I will be putting this on my shopping list to buy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I usually use a different brand but decided to give ponds a shot. It goes on a little greasy at first but I do have to say it holds up well, and is great for skin like mine which is very very dry. When using it under foundation it helped the makeup stay looking dwey instead of dry and caked [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I noticed subtle improvements in the first week of use. The scent was a little strong for me and I would prefer an unscented version. My skin is very sensitive and this cream was slightly irritating the first day or so, but since I like the results I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been a Pond's fan for quite some time now. I love that they have come out with new formulas that are fitting for multiple skin issues. I really love this product sample. Im impressed with the results I can already see after just a few days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The second ingredient is lactic acid- so it had a huge amount of active AHA- it absorbs well and feels great. It has a heavy scent, so I use it at night. It's lower price, compared to other similar quality products lets me slather it on liberally. It has a huge number of beneficial skin enhancing ingredients in the formula.

I'm a basic woman when it comes to skincare.i usually wash my face every night with noxema ( which I have used since a teenager) and then use the ponds anti aging cream. First of all it has such a great scent which is always a plus and it's so soft on the skin as far as the claim of anti aging I don't know because I have only used it for about a week but it does make my skin a silky and soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product twice and find the scent very pleasant and love that I now have moisturized skin with out the greasy feel. Several wrinkles near the corners of my eyes have disappeared. Love the price for the quality of this product is worth the visit the Pond's website for more information. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I thoroughly enjoyed this product. My skin is sensitive to new creams and I usually break out. This cream did not make me break out. I like how my skin felt the next morning after using it. The product is not heavy like some lotions can be. It applies smoothly. I will be using this product from here on out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
For a while now I've felt like my skin is aging poorly. 27 and had fine lines and horrible pores. I was over the the moon I got it. While i didn't have a big sample enough for continued use in order to see results it did make my skin feel wonderful. Have to get more so I'll be able to see results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used the cheapest and the most expensive and this one is perfect... After just one week of use my face is soft and my complexion has smoothed dramatically (obviously results may vary). This is a really good light moisturizer that is really good for under makeup and it is light and non greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I had not used Pond's products for many years. I know they have been around a while because my grandmother used the cold cream more than 40 years ago. I expected this to be a lot like the stuff she used and just like that I found it to be a great product, My skin felt soft and the fine lines were gone. After all these years Ponds is stiil making great products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really didn't notice anything different or spectacular about this product. I've been using it for about a week now and my skin's texture remains the same. No visible changes. I'll keep using it until it's gone because maybe it needs more time to produce results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This product doesn't make my skin feel greasy or leave a residue which is a huge part of whether or not I will even consider a product. It left my skin feeling moisturized and smooth. Any type of anti-aging product needs to be used consistently and for a period of time, so I didn't use it long enough to be able to look at my skin as youthful again, but I look forward to buying a full size jar and experiencing the youthfulness of my skin as well!

There are still wrinkles of course, but not like before. I'm anxious to see the full results of using this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product made my normal/dry skin extremely greasy. I applied it after showering and couldn't get the greasy shine to go away, even with oil absorbing/ shine reducing powder.

This product is creamy to touch but makes skin feel super soft. one thing that I don't care for that much is the oily feeling.

When I hear the brandname Ponds I think of the old cold cream my sister used waaaaaaay back when but having the chance to try out their newer products has really changed my mind about the company.

I have trusted ponds brand in the past and know many people who love this brand.

Not a fan!! The scent of the product is overwhelming. It is thick and greasy and doesn't absorb into the skin very well. Hard to tell if it is going to do what it claims when I can't get it to absorb into the layers of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I think this is a great product and I really Like Ponds. I am still young so I don't use anti-aging creams that much but when I do I will use ponds!

"I like the way my skin feels after I apply it after cleansing. My skin feels soft, slightly papery (due to the type of AHA) but soft. Unfortunately, the fragrance is overpowering. It's like sugary floral baby powder or something. The fragrance lingers and clashes with my perfume. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This product was great at moisturizing. However I have combination skin so it left extra oily patches in some areas and I even ended up with a big 'ol pimple on my nose from so much oil. But just the same it worked great on my dry spots but I didn't notice a big difference in wrinkles and such. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used Ponds over the years and find I will come back to it because of the quality and efficacy of delivery. An affordable alternative to other products that really don't work. I use Ponds with other brands because I have found switching out face beauty creams every 3 months or more help keep my complexion bright and fresh. Ponds has a little bit of a perfume smell that is a little more than I like, but the results make up for that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I was skeptical at first to try it at first but when I applied it, it didnt burn like other creams do, it did not irritate my skin at all.

"I think of Pond's as cold cream, which this product definitely is not. It is a good moisturizer, but not better than what I already use. I don't have a lot of wrinkles and fine lines yet-- I'm a fat 28 year old, so my face is round and smooth-- but maybe I will want this product again in 20 years.

"This was my first time using an anti-aging cream, because I currently don't feel like I need any. However, I felt like the Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream made my skin feel tighter, which would cause wrinkles to become less noticeable.

I am in love with this product. I was born with under-eye bags and also crease lines and using this product helped diminish then after 3 days of use.

I loved this skin cream because it did not irritate my skin. I don't normally purchase anti-wrinkle skin care but now that I am 40 I think I should start using one just to keep my skin in check. I love that it doesn't have a powerful scent. The application was soft and smooth and my skin loved it. I can't wait to see what type of results I get.

"I found the scent horrible, it reminded me of a nursing home. My skin felt tacky/sticky and oily all day- not moisturized. more like oily for sure. I have not noticed any improvement in my skin. My pores seem to have become larger with use and I wake up every am with lots of tiny white pimples all over my nose, chin and jaw line. It may work great for someone else but not me.

"Pinch Me sent a good size sample, actually a jar of Pond's Anti Aging Cream to try. I loved the packaging clean and simple. The cream inside was light and refreshing, not to heavy, or scented. From the moment I put it on I knew I would like the cream. It has a creamy but light texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have always trusted Olay products my mother used it and now I use it. It leaves your skin feeling smooth and ready to start the day and at night it helps you sleep feeling pampered. Best of all it does what it says on its label. My skin is brighter and younger looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this cream before I went to bed as a night cream and in the morning, my skin had a beautiful glow to it. My face felt a little firmer and my laugh lines around my mouth didn't seem as prominent. Everything is going good so far [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had never tried Ponds before but I should have been using it all along! I saw noticeable difference after using the product for 14 days! I intend to buy Ponds on my next shopping trip!!
I recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have to say that I honestly had forgotten about Ponds. Also as a child I fondly remember my grandmother having it in her bathroom so to me it was ""an old ladies cream""! Boy was I wrong! Ponds has really done a great job with this cream. It moisturizes wonderfully and left my skin so soft. I never would have bought this on my own so I'm so thankful that I was able to try this sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm very surprised by the quality of this product. This lotion does what it says. My skin feels smoother and looks refreshed. I swear my skin feels more hydrated and plump. I was surprised that my skin felt so good with just a few a few applications. I like this brand too. My grandmother only used Ponds and she had incredible skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have purchased many moisturizers and anti aging creams over the years. many can be overpriced so its been wonderful to be able to try this one before considering purchasing. this product was creamy but not oily or too thick and it left me feeling hydrated. I havent used it long enough to notice any major differences or improvemens (I just received my box this week). I would buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product goes onto skin smoothly and with ease. It feels lightweight, fresh and not greasy. The Rejuveness cream also has a wonderfully pleasing light scent. I'm so thankful for the chance to sample this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As a male I wasn't sure this was the product for me. But I work in the sun & it shows. So I gave it a try & wow! My skin is so soft & feels incredible after each application. It smells very clean too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am all about taking care of your skin. If it improves some imperfections or restore your youth, i am all for it. With ponds, i felt like it was preventing my skin from aging and i felt so good about myself after applying it. Will definitely purchase in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been purchasing Pond's products for years now and I always love their products. It works pretty well. I tried it on my forehead and I noticed a difference. My mom tried it and she liked it as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this cream for a couple of days now and I must say I really like it. It's a tick but moisturizing cream that leaves your skin feeling soft. The only negative thing I have to say about this product is the fragrance, I kind of very strong but other than that I'm satisfied with this product especially since it's good quality and affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've only been using it for a few days, so I haven't seen results yet, but I love the way it feels on my skin. It smells really good, too. I appreciate the bigger sample size, so I can continue using to see if I get results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have known the brand Ponds since I was a teenager, now that I am not getting any younger its good to have a product that Ive grown with. Unfortunately, I can not speak for it's effectivity yet. But it would be good to have an all natural product from Ponds. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm excited to use this product and how well it will work for me. First impression, it smells great, pleasant texture and feel, not too greasy. I'm using it under my makeup and seems to be very moisturizing. I just started using it so it's too soon to see any real results yet with reducing wrinkles. Even without the benefit of reducing wrinkles I'd still use it as a regular moisturizering cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought this was a nice facial cream, did a good job of moisturizing. I did not really see any anti-aging benefits (othere than moisturizing) so I would mark it down for that but it felt nice on my skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It tightens the skins, goes on very creamy and smooth! I like the scent, ppl have been saying it's kind of strong, but I really like it! I use it before bed, and before I put my makeup on in the morning. It seems to make my makeup last a little longer! I really like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I opened my pinch menos at my parents house and almost had my mom swipe it before I even saw it. She swears by it.
So now to my thoughts on it. It is a very soft feminine scent.it had a very light feel to it. After 3/4 days I can see some changes in the lines I have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I only recently started using Ponds products for my skin care routine. However, at the time of receiving this product, I had yet to try this specific product. Personally, I really enjoy using Ponds; the smell is minimal yet pleasant, it goes on the skin smoothly and absorbs nicely, and it does seem to improve the quality of my skin. I will definitely be purchasing more Ponds skincare products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of this product to try it for free. Even though it appears to be a really good, effective and affordable product, I'm not sure this is the ideal for me, since it has a strong scent. I have nasal allergy, so it is better to keep my facial products with no smell. I did however gave the rest of the bottle to my mother and she loved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Before this, I thought Ponds was just and ""Old lady"" company, but this product design looked youthful and fun! I liked how the product felt on my skin. I like that Ponds is breaking out and becoming more hip. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The smell is great! The cream really feels like it is rejuvenating my skin. I'm not a big fan of the silk residue however, i view that as the lotion is really working. Can't wait to see what using it every day will do to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product smells great and is an easy part of my morning and evening routine. It is gentle enough to wear under makeup and not oily for night wear. It is too soon to tell re: results, but I am optimistic. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I could feel a difference on my face and neck as soon as I applied this as I applied this product. My skin definitely feels tighter already. The cream is not oily at all and feels very silky and light when applied. It has a very light, pleasant scent that is not at all overpowering or strong. The sample size I received was a very nice amount and will be more than enough to use for two weeks to test the product's claim that it will visibly reduce wrinkles in two weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not love this cream. I used it under my eyes and instead of improving dark circles/lines I feel as if it just made things worse, maybe thats just me! I am overall young and do not need this product, so I gave the rest to a family member and will leave an additional review after it has been tested! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This makes my face sting like the regular ponds. I saw the warning in the label about waiting before applying but the tingling would only occur if there was an irritant, which this product has many of. I have relatively sensitive skin so that plays a part. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only used this product for about a week now, and I can already see a difference. The skin under my jaw line looks and feels firmer! and I noticed that those little lines around my lips are dissapearing too! I am so happy that I have recommended this to my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using ponds I must say it has left my face smoother and younger looking. The little fine lines by my eyes seem to less visible. I also love the non greedy feel you some times get from other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have only been using this product for a few days, so it is hard to say if it is working as far as aging defense. I can tell you that I love the way it makes my skin feel and it has a good scent to it. I love the little bottle that it comes in too. It is not bulky and fits anywhere. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just tried Ponds rejuvenating wrinkle cream and I really like it. There's no harsh scent which I'm very sensitive to. I'm also not a fan to greasy lotions and creams. Ponds is not greasy at all. I recommend this product to friends and family highly. Thank you Pinch Me and thank you Ponds for giving me the chance to see and try for my self before buying,, which I intend to once my sample is finished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am unsure if Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging Cream lives up to it's claims, as I wasn't interested in trying it more than once. The smell and texture were not pleasing to me. It had a chemical/floral smell (odd combo) and a heavy texture. It wasn't greasy, per se, just heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"product feels great, haven't had time to try it for the amount of time the bottle touts to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Probably would be best for winter use as I have oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ponds - trusted name, gotta be a great product, right? I tried to get past the fragrance, but it smelled too ""old lady"" for me...then I started breaking out after using it. Sorry, gotta take it off my regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love any products from Olay love any products from Olay they are a brand that has been around for many years and I trust the company with my beauty needs and was extremely thrilled to get this freebie [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used to use Pond's when I was in my late teens and I had forgotten how much I liked it. It disappears into skin and does not leave it sticky or tacky. It's a brand that works well to slow down the signs of aging. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Sometimes I think you have to be reminded of the old but tried and true brands. This worked just as well as the other brands I've tried and the price was much better. So happy to have sampled this. Will buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My great grandmother use to use this brand all the time. I am not a fan of the smell It maybe because I have only used it once I havent seen any results maybe my opinion will change after continued use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I didn't like the scent. It smelled like some thing an old woman would wear. It also didn't feel smooth or silky on my face but heavy and a little sticky feeling and I really didn't see or feel any results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love Ponds products and use them everyday in the morning and night and in between the day. This is a great product for those of us who want to prevent wrinkles in our face and stay beautiful for a long time. I myself don't use sunblock that often, and my doctor told me that using it everyday prevents wrinkles in the future, so this ponds product is a great product to use when you forget to use sunblock everyday. Go try it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't notice a huge difference, but it's only been about two weeks since i started using. normally, i wouldn't expect a huge difference with a topical cream in fighting wrinkles in that time period, but the packaging claims that fine lines should disappear in two weeks. i wouldn't say that happened by any means, but it appeared to help a little and definitely didn't have any negative effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This stuff is magic! Even though I am not in the complete need for a product like this quite yet at my age, the cream still makes my skin feel like I don't have to worry about wrinkles or anything. It makes my skin feel super soft [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed sampling this product. It seems to be effective in what it promises. I do prefer the brand I use over this particular one, but would still recommend this one as an effective product to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Approaching 50 I am really thinking about products such as this. I love the consistency and promises this product says it will do. I've just received the item and it says that I should see benefits in two weeks so I guess I'll have to buy a full size product so I can really weigh the full results of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
this anti wrinkle cream has a pleasant scent. I haven't used it long enough to know if the anti wrinkle properties are working. I smoothed the product over my face and neck after cleansing. My face and neck feel smooth . I will see if it helps with wrinkles. So far I am happy with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love how Pond's cream makes my skin glow and it isn't heavy or thick you just need a very small about to get the job done. I get compliments all the time about how smooth and younger I look and I feel that way as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"The cream was pleasant smelling and had a nice texture, but im not entirely concerned with anti-aging products at the moment. I am also not connected to/drawn to the Ponds brand. I much prefer Garnier for anti-aging or preventative aging products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Pond's brand always says something about the product, but they over did themselves with this anti-wrinkle cream. It was so light on my face and I love that. I hate feeling like I'm putting body butter on my face! This will be a part of my skin care regimen, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoy using this product. my skin has a great new glow about it. I really enjoy the way it feels and is non greasy. I highly recommend this product. Once you give it a try you will love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Was a little hesitant about trying out an anti-aging cream for the very first time. But I really love how soft Ponds made my skin feel. I haven't been using it that long to notice a huge difference but I have noticed by skin looking more brighter! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Definately will be using POND'S REJUVENESS ANTI-AGING CREAM for my facial needs. The cream is very light, and seems to sink into my skin. This product made the fine lines around my eyes less noticeable and rehydrated my skin without leaving it feeling oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't see any difference, but they do say these products only work correctly with extended, consistent use, which I admit I probably won't be trying with this product. If I'm going to use an anti-aging product I think I'll stick with something with more potent ingredients, not to take anything away from this cream as it seems perfectly on par with it's competitors. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really did like receiving this sample because i was wondering if they are any good for a while now and when i used it i can tell the difference between my old one and ponds i just hadnt purchased it but i can say now i will definitely switch over to this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this from Pinchme for testing and I have to say I do like this cream, the texture is nice and not too thick. It felt nice on my face and the scent was pleasant not too strong for me.

"I don't have a lot of wrinkles, but the smile lines I have were less noticeable after using once. I love how this sinks into my skin and doesn't leave my face greasy. The only thing I don't like is the scent but it's very bearable. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is very lush and made my skin feel the same. My grandmother used Ponds for years and had great skin, but I admit that I thought of it as an old lady cream. Let me tell you this is not the case. The smell is better than ever, it has a great texture and absorbs like a dream. My skin felt and looked more refreshed and hydrated. Time will tell if it fights the aging but so far I love it.

I love all of the ponds moisturizers and I loved this one as well. My skin felt super soft after using just one time. It does have a rather strong scent which is my only con but aside from that I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Pond's Cold Cream and Dry Skin Cream, both of which I use for cleansing. This cream has a stronger smell, which is not unpleasant, but I could smell and taste it all day. It burned when I applied it to my face and it made the small lines near my mouth red and therefore much more noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Very creamy and smells wonderful. Makes my skin feel very soft after using it but still isn't greasy. My wrinkles aren't very pronounced so I'm not sure if cream would be helping them too much but I like the way it feels. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was nice but just not for me. My skin it combo oily dry and I guess it just gets too oily for me. Plus my face got a little red so I think there is something in it that irritates my face. Unfortunately I will not continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Nice product. I normally use Olay products and hadn't tried Pond's but was surprised at how well it compares. I will definitely look for it in store and see if I can save some money over buying Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the smell and feeling of this anti aging cream. This is the first anti aging cream I have ever used and I'm glad to have had such a positive experience. It has not made me break out and has made my skin softer. I did receive a sample of this product in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Because this takes up to 2 weeks to show signs that it is working I am still waiting to see affects. So far I have seen a little change under my eyes. At first I thought it was a little greasy feeling but once it soaked into my skin it did not leave that feeling. Having oily skin already, that made a huge affect on whether I will be purchasing this product after I am finished with this container. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First off the sample was a great size! It wasn't in a a one time use sample. This really helps in giving a good review because I was able to use it for more than one time. I liked the texture and consistent of Pond's. The only thing I didn't like was the scent. It doesn't smell bad, I just personally like any face cream with no scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only apply it at night since it doesn't have SPF. I would definitely buy if it does. It works well as a moisturizer, but I feel like I have to use a little more to cover up my face and really feel how soft it is. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can tell this is a new and improved formula. Before it was really hard to apply, and it would rub off during application of make up. Now, it's better, but my skin is slightly less greasy, but more oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I Thought about ponds when the sample poped up just because it has been around for a long time and I wasn't sure why I hadn't tried it. But thankfully I was introduced I havnt even used it the two weeks yet which is recommended to see results and my skin is super smooth and the fine lines are already less noticeable. There is deffinantly a reason this brand has withstood the test of time! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the first time I have tried a Ponds product. So far I do enjoy the lightness and texture. It is not greasy and heavy as some creams can tend to be. My face feels moisturized and soft. I am going to contue to try it, as it is early in seeing real results, but testing has been positive and that is what keeps me buying more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Smells great and makes my skin feel soft. It's easy to use and doesn't feel greasy or oily. Ponds has proven themselves time and time again. there is a reason they have been around forever and still work! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm not sure how I feel about this product yet I have been testing it on my skin following directions for a week now i have been rubbing the ponds on my left hand to see if there's a difference now it's been a week not seeing any results yet but I'm sure it will come soon as it does state noticing a difference in two weeks we will see [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I just started using this product and I love it. this product is an AHA chemical exfoliant, which means that it encourages rapid turnover in you skin cells. This is great to helping to heal (and prevent) fine lines but you MUST use sunscreen. You'll be a lot more sensitive to the sun so that is super important. This is a lactic acid AHA, so it is pretty gentle on the skin. The directions tell you to use the product twice a day, but I find that it works much better as a night cream.

I think many people look past the name ponds thinking it's outdated and old. but this is really a great product I am very impressed with how it's been working on my skin.it does not irritate my skin in any way. it absorbs very well and has a great sense. I recommend this product to every woman out there that's looking to get rid of fine lines and wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have very sensitive dry skin and not many products work for me so it's not necessarily the product I didn't like. Caused me breakouts like almost everything does but I think it'll do amazing for someone with less sensitive skin. Maybe normal/combo skin types. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did not know that Pond's made anti-aging creams. I really liked how moisturizing this cream seemed to be. It made my skin very soft and seemed to improve the texture of my skin. I noticed that it filled in or made some fine lines less noticeable when applied under makeup. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I haven't had much time to use this product, but it seems like it will work very well. I hope it can help with fine forehead lines. It seems like a little goes a long way and it takes a while to absorb into the skin. It smells nice, too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how this contains lactic acid which works as and exfoliant. I skin felt much smoother and looked brighter. The smell was pretty strong though. It wasn't an awful smell but I would it rather be light and possibly cleaner since it is so powerful. I can't believe how affordable it was for such a product.

"Since turning 30, I have become obsessed with finding the right skin care routine. I get monthly samples in my Birchbox of high end serums and moisturizers, and this one blows those out of the water!! It smells great, feels great, and is not expensive! Will definitely be buying and implementing this into my regular skin care regimen. Yay!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have only recieved this sample a few days ago and so far I really like it! It is not thick and heavy on my skin which I love. Doesn't feel sticky after application which is another bonus. I use the cold cream and have for years so hoping this will be a great addition to my morning routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I know this brand is a classic so I was looking forward to trying it. I tried it as specified but I have naturally oily skin. I did not feel as though it was being absorbed. It felt like it was sitting on my skin and made me feel like my face was greasy. Maybe I will use it to remove the makeup or only on dry spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Ponds product is really good, I tried it on my husband and it made his skin soft and he really liked it. I used it and it broke me out. Now, please do not take this as it will break you out if you use it. I have extremely sensitive skin and if I use anything but Lever 2000 to clean it, I have problems. It is not necessarily the product but more my skin. On my husband, it did really great so I would recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My great grandmother used Ponds and I thought I wouldn't see the day that I used it. I love it and I see why she used it. Brand we can trust and use gracefully.

"I have been using this product for only a week, however, I noticed results after the first use, my skin was smoother, and had a glow to it, it was moisturizing but non-greasy.

"I love everything about this. The sample size was huge and will last a long time which makes me happy because I can use it long enough and start seeing results. The scent smells really good, it doesnt break out my skin, its easy to apply and doesnt weight down my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm young and don't really need this. But some people start anti aging treatments early. I don't like how strong the scent is though especially on the face. I didn't like how it made my face feel. There was a bit of a tingling sensation and it made my skin feel very oily and greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Pond's Rejuveness Anti-Aging cream was not what I expected from the Pond's brand. I had always thought that was the type of cream used by older women (my mother's age) but found it applied smoothly and left my skin feeling soft and clean. I intend to buy a larger size to see if it will effectively reduce the wrinkles around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I like how it feels on my skin. It doesn't necessarily feel lightweight but it doesn't feel heavy either, but I like the way it makes my skin feel and it does have a perfume smell to it, which its not too strong or overbearing but it there is a noticeble smell to it that smells like flowers. Overall I like it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This has been a great experience. I have never really tried a anti wrinkle formula before until I got this. The day I received it I started it right away and I no it says may take up to 2 weeks to see a deference that is okay with me. I feel better and beautiful putting it on . Thank you!

This is my issue with most samples of skin care. I can't give a full honest opinion because the sample amount is never enough to use to see the full effects. I used the sample sparingly and was able to get 5 uses out of it. Still it is suppose to be used for 30 days before results can be seen. I did feel a tightness of the skin but my normal wash does that. I think I would skip this one and spend a little more money on a more effect cream like strivectin.

"I like how smoothly it goes onto my skin. The scent is light and disappears quickly which I prefer. The only thing I would change is the container - I prefer a pump bottle rather than sticking my fingers into a pot. But the product feels nice, is very moisturizing. We'll see if it helps with the fine lines, I have only been using it for a few days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great product. It felt great on my skin after I applied it. My skin felt soft and moisturized. I will purchase this product once I finish the brand I currently have. I have already recommended it to family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed this product, but I do not plan to buy it in the near future only because I don't need it yet. When I do need it, I will look into purchasing it. I do plan to recommend this product to family that uses anti-aging cream. I loved the scent, texture, and overall feel of the product. It made my face feel refreshed.

"I really enjoyed using this Pond's anti-aging cream. The cream was gentle on my sensitive skin, light weight, had a pleasant scent, and was highly effective on diminishing the appearance of my wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I would purchase Pond's Anti Aging Cream on my own. The cream had a nice scent to it. It made my face feel good and smoothed my skin. I was always told that Pond's is a recommended brand to stick with as it's been around for years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product felt heavy on my face it actually felt like I had something left on my face. You want a revitalizing face cream to not be heavy feeling because you're putting it on under your makeup and that's already have enough it caused me to break out a little bit [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although the product wasn't bad, I am skeptical of the benefits of anti-aging products. I have read scholarly articles that prove they can be more damaging than helpful, so I am not a fan. For those that choose this product it seemed comparable to other other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used many creams for my face and I fell in love with this product from Ponds. It does the same for my face as the more expensive brands. I love how my face feels after I use it. Very hydrating without feeling sticky [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I purchased this product for my mom who is in her late 50s and she loves it. I tried a little on my face too, and although I don't need anti-aging products just yet, I could feel the tautness and the smoothness she mentioned. It's a little pricier than your regular facial moisturizer from the grocery store but you'll appreciate what it does for your skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So, skin showing signs of aging is a touchy subject for me. I've tried as many creams, ointments, etc as I can to combat it. Not sure if this sample will be ""The One"" , but it certainly did not disappoint ! ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was great to use and it never left my face feeling greasy or covered with a non breathable material.. I liked the light feel.. it also helped me get rid of some of the fine wrinkles around my mouth and eyes.. it also works on hands! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
this is the brand my grandma used and she had amazing skin when she passed. this brand was the only thing she used so it made me want to use it. i like the light scent. its light no grease. and i feel amazing when i wake up [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've started out with the small sample sized container. A small amount of this cream goes a long way; the texture is very wet and silky, absorbs into my skin quickly and is light enough to wear with sunscreen and makeup (if the sunscreen is sheer enough, otherwise get foundation that has sunscreen in it.) The scent is pleasant although somewhat strong at first, it does fade quickly enough and doesn't interfere with my perfume. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I apply this cream after I shower and it has made my skin feel hydrated and soft. No breakouts like some other creams I have used. POND'S REJUVENESS ANTI-AGING CREAM is my go to when I want a thicker face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I stick to the brands that my family has said for years and they work. That is why they are still here. Everyone has different skin, so try it. I liked it and will buy it. My skin at 42 needs some help and what works for me might not work for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm loving it so far n I have tried products that cost $$ n nothing but this is great n it's not like ur going to look like you did when you was 18! but who does but it's well worth it n ur skin feels so good n you do see the difference just don't miss out on this go grab it n give it a try !!!

I love the feel of this cream. Plus it's much cheaper than what I have been using. I started using anti wrinkle cream this year as a preventative. I have found some creams to be too strong and cause redness. So far Ponds has been the most gentle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the smell, the cream goes on smooth, and I didn't experience any bad skin irritation or anything. However, I don't see any difference in my skin. I've used it for 2.5 months. I don't have wrinkles but a few fine lines on my forehead. They are still there. No visible difference in my skin tone or texture. So this is not a product I would continue to buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Rejuveness for about three weeks and I can see a definite difference. The fine lines I was getting in the corners of my mouth have smoothed out. It also seems to have helped around my eyes and on my forehead. I also love how my skin feels, much softer."
"I purchased the sample size of this product to use as an under-eye treatment. After getting home I thought about how sensitive my skin is, especially on my face. I decided to only use it on my neck area, which was starting to show my age, and I can't how old I was the last time my neck area looked this good. I am now using Rejuveness under my eyes, a couple of days each week, and there is a significant difference. Thank you for this product!!!"
Ponds is a product my mom uses & my grandma used before her. Both are big on not using a lot of stuff for skincare but Ponds was always something they kept on hand & used daily. I haven't been one to adopt that habit but after trying this I my consider it in the future. I liked the light smell & the fact that it was fairly easy to rinse off. Some Exfoliants can require several rinses to remove it all. I enjoy using exfoliates in general so I enjoyed this one too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Im not one to use too many creams, but I am a big Ponds user. I was put on the two week antiwrinkle challenge. I have to say, I love the results on my face! I would recommend to anyone who is looking to change the way your face looks. I tested POND'S for free, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thanks to Influenster I had a chance to test Pond's Rejuveness for free. Honestly I don't have much for wrinkles so even though I took the 2-week challenge, I was testing based on other things. It really felt great on my skin. I could feel the softness when I put it on and it did feel like it was working. I can see why Pond's is a classic that stands the test of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked how this product doesn't have any bad ingredients that are harmful for the skin and that it works great as a moisturizer. I am realistic and know nothing will get rid of the wrinkles that I have started to get, but the Ponds Rejuveness helped with keeping my skin moisturized which helps reduce how the wrinkles appear. The draw backs for me is that has a scent and I wish there was an SPF version. I tested this product was sent to me to test for free, all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The powdery smell is the only negative. It leaves my skin smooth and soft. I use this at night as it does leave my combination skin a bit oily after awhile. I haven't used it long enough to see wrinkle improvement as this was provided to me through Influenster for a two week challenge. I will happily purchase this once I run out. It moisturizes so well and has improved my skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used POND'S Rejuveness for two weeks. I received a complimentary bottle from Influenster for testing purposes. I applied at night. I did not apply for daytime use because it contains no SPF protection. The lotion goes on smoothly but feels a little heavy. I did not really notice a reduction in wrinkles. Opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this rejuveness cream through influester for free and I loved it. I used it every morning and night for two weeks and really saw change on my skin it made my skin firm and hydrated.

"I received this product for testing a few weeks ago. I am so excited to say it really works. I tried for 2 weeks and this cream has my skin feeling flawless. I look and feel a little younger after trying this product. Can't wait to purchase more. I tested POND'S products for free, but all opinions are mines"
Although I do not look my age it is still important to keep the wrinkles at bay. This item will become part of my daily regimen in combating dark spots and wrinkles. I did receive this product for testing purposes from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I agreed to take the Two Week Challenge, I didn't expect to see the results that I experienced. I did find that using it twice a day was a little much for my skin, so during the final week, I only used it once a day. Still, the results were clear. I see a huge difference in the fine lines on my forehead and around my eyes. I will continue to use this product daily! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I took the Pond's Rejuveness two-week anti wrinkle challenge. I applied it to my face and neck after washing, every morning and every evening. My skin feels soft smooth and my fine lines around my eyes are almost completely gone. I will continue to use this product and recommend it to everyone. I got it free from influenster & pond's to test and review! Amazing product. #seeforyourself #contest @ponds @influenster I got it free and all options are my own.

I've been using this product for a little over three weeks and I love it. I use it twice a day after washing my face. Once in the morning and then again in the evening. My face feels tighter now and the small lines at the edge of my eyes are not that noticeable now. This is a product that I will continue to use and recommend to others. I tested this product for free but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am satisfied with PONDS daily. PONDS left my face feeling soft, moisturized in the morning and evening. I really enjoyed the light feeling PONDS had on my face. There was a little fresh scent. It wasn't sticky on my face, it didn't burn or sting which was great. I haven't noticed my wrinkles as much. I don't think that PONDS did anything regarding my wrinkles. The wrinkles were still there, not heavy or light looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using Rejuveness for two weeks. I started using it as part of a review for Influenster, and am so happy with it, I'll continue using it. Fine lines are less noticeable, and my skin feels smoother. I love that my skin doesn't feel tight, like after the use of some products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't able to use this product much. It is too harsh for my sensitive skin. Even when I wait an hour after cleansing, it still burns my skin. So I can't say if it would help fine lines or not. If your skin is not so sensitive you should try this product. I received this product complimentary for reviewing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product everyday for two weeks. I can definitely see that the fine lines around my eyes are significantly reduced. Has a nice fragrance and love the creamy texture. Can't wait to see my results after a month of use. The opinions are mine but I received product free for review.  [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream has a nice powdery smell and absorbs into the skin well. I've used it for almost a month and it has not caused any breakouts or irritation. I received it from Influenster free to test and I'm very pleased with it. I will definitely continue to include it in my daily skin routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really wanted to love Rejuveness, but I found that it made my face very oily over the course of the day, in combination with the Clarant B3 Dry moisturizer. I love the idea of reducing wrinkles, but my makeup would just slide off by noon because of the oiliness. I am 46, almost 47, so wrinkles and aging skin are a big concern for me. I like the scent, I liked the way it went on, it has a lovely texture. If you have drier skin, I think this would be great for you. I tested this POND'S product for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I have pretty fussy skin but I trust Pond's skincare prodicts. They rarely make me break out and never cause the hives that lots of other products do. I tried POND'S® - Rejuveness and it, unfortunately, did make me break out. Right now I have cradle cap, or seborrheic dermatitis, across some of my face, and I am sure the breakout was in part due to that. I still like POND'S® cold cream. It's a classic! I received a sample of this product for free to try and review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"In just 2 weeks youll see the difference in how your skin looks. Be sure to take a photo and another photo to compare yourself. Its non greasy, smooth, absorbs quickly and smells pleasant. Apply it to your face and neck, dont forget your neck! I used this product day and night after cleaning my face. Feels lightweight and good on my skin. I tested this POND'S products for free, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recently took the 2 week challenge. I used the moisturizer in the morning and at night before bed following washing my face. I have to say that I did not notice much of a difference in my fine lines, but my skin did feel softer and more supple. I liked the scent very much and appreciated that it was very lightweight. If my go to moisturizer was unavailable, I would use this product. I received this product for free, but all the opinions are my own [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've tried many moisturizers over the past year. I've started the aging process and I've been on the lookout for a great moisturizer. Ponds Rejuveness keeps my skin hydrated and never leaves it with a greasy look. I love the big size jar. It lasts a very long time. I really like that this can be used all over your face and neck. It leaves my skin looking flawless. I use this twice a day and will continue using this. I absolutely love it! I received a sample for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first tried it I noticed how silky smooth the moisturizer was. It felt good on and was very easy to apply. After applying it morning and night for 2 weeks I have definitely noticed less wrinkles, especially around the eye area. It is a slight difference, but I think I will really see even more improvement the longer I use the product. The smell is pleasant and not over powering at all. I tested this product for free, but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Unfortunately, this didn't work out for me. Each day I used it, by the end of the day my eyes would be very watery and sting. It took me a few days to realize that it was the product. I don't love the way it smells. It did make my skin fairly smooth. I think it might work of others! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i got to try this as a free sample from influenster . i tried this for a week i applied it 2 times a day after a week i saw a big difference!

"I obtained a sample from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I have ALWAYS USED ponds Cold Cream, but this was my first time trying a moisturizer from Ponds. This made my skin feel amazing. I have received so many compliments inn y skin lately. At first I forgot that I was trying a new product but the next morning when I was getting ready for the day I realized it must be the new Ponds. I will be buying this again and again.

"I have been using this product for about 3 weeks now. I have fine lines on my forehead and under my eyes. At first, I saw little to no improvement after about 10 days but as I continued to use it, the lines on my forehead are almost completely gone. The overall texture of my skin has also improved to the point of very smooth and healthy. I received these products for testing purposes from Influenster but these are my own personal reviews.

Ponds has been used in my family for years. Over time it has smooth out some of the wrinkles. Maybe not all of them. but it has a few of them. It's nice to have a cream to depend on. I received the product(s) complimentary to test and/or review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"With this being a night cream, I was a little worried about how it would feel on my skin, but this is light and a little tingly. I didn't get any heavy, greasy feeling from it, and even after just a few days, I'm not seeing any clogged pores...but I AM seeing a reduction in some of the finer lines near my eyes and mouth. Looking forward to continuing to use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product courtesy Influesnter is excellent make prefect work with my skin i love now look i cant believe that a nice work in me because sometime i pay a lot for another products a lot money [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have to agree with the others that complained about the fragrance. It's very over powering. It would be nice to have the option of a fragrance-free version. Other than that, it seems to be a great moisturizer at a great price. However, I probably won't be able to continue with this product due to the smell."
"Performs much better than some very expensive moisturizers I've tried. Picked up a sample size on a whim at Wal-Mart, and will continue to use this. Face feels very soft & moisturized, wrinkles are lessened, and the AHAs seem to be brightening my skin. Nice job, Ponds!"
Great product affordable price and the product smells great.
This night cream is amazing !! Helps with fine lines but it dries too fast ! Good price !!
"Hi, I want you to send me some products. I'm really fascinated and I'd love to try them please."
For the price you can't beat the amazing results. I reach for this product every time.
This product really does work on wrinkles. I can see the difference in my wrinkles they are almost invisible now using ponds rejuveness.
I love this cream. Someone sugested it to me and I have been using it for 4 months and I see the difference. I love it!
"I like this product! I use it every night as my overnight moisturizer. It is a little heavy, but it works well. Im 19 so I don't have wrinkles yet but hey... just trying to prevent them!"
This is the best product you can find in the market. I highly recommend it to all my followers. For several years this product can not be missing in my daily life.
"One of the best face creams in the drugstore. A little bit too oily but if you can get past that, it is extremely moisturizing and plumping. Great for reducing fine lines and has my 55 year old mom looking 40."
"This anti wrinkle cream was ok. I have used others that I thought were better. But at the same time it wasn't terrible either. Just nothing that stood out to me honestly. I would buy it again, if nothing else were available at the time."
"Very good basic night cream. Does a decent job with my fine lines. Will remove makeup in a pinch like the old cold cream. Not well suited for acne prone skin if used regularly. However, it's great for me if I target certain areas."
This cream is really great. I use it to moisturize my face before I put on my makeup. It is an essential for me. It really leaves skin smooth and it doesn't leave it oily.
"I've been using this cream at night since I was 11. I am absolutely terrified of getting wrinkles so I found that this helps my face stay fresh. My skin feels smoother and tighter every time I apply it, so I highly recommend this to everyone."
Just started using this product yesterday so I can't give this more stars. It has a pleasant smell and goes on easy. I have not noticed a greasy feeling or anything. Hopefully it kicks wrinkles in the butt!
Smells amazing! Really good packaging! Definitely notice a difference when I put this on my skin becomes a lot smoother. Goes on smoothly and sinks into skin really well!
"I use this daily and it's very affordable, I haven't really noticed any difference, it Does keep the dryness around my nose cleared up but that's about it ."
"I like this cream, I use it after washing my face and I apply it before going to sleep and thus obtain better results. This cream leaves the face very soft despite being a little thick. However, the product works wonders in my face. I recommend it."
Anti age cream and makes my under eyes and bags look less noticeable definitely recommend to others helps minimize the appearance of wrinkles aswell can buy it at a drugstore pharmacy nearby affordable and effective
"I did get some results I haven't been using it that long to give a fair review but so far it's working great it's been gentle on my skin, you can find this at a drug store or Hispanic supermarket I've seen that they have it out in the shelves!"
I'm pretty impressed with this product. I have noticed a difference in fine lines around my eyes. I can't complain about the price either. I shared it with my mom and she's also a fan. I'll be buying more to see how it works longterm.
"I love this product! I tried a travel size jar for two weeks. Made a big change in my skin, its smoother, softer and lines are less noticeable. The scent is very nice, soft, not overpowering. Great product, don't change a thing!"
I have very dry skin and I have tried many face creams over the years. This one is hands down the best! It moisturizes my skin all day long without feeling sticky and works great under my makeup.
"Bought it about a wk ago just looking and saw the ponds that i had seen on the web and had to try. It does not lv the skin greasy ,dries quickly and seems like i can already see results"
I have been using this product for 6 months and it truly has worked for me. I would definitely recommend it to family and friends. I Just wish it had SP.
"I love this product! it really does reduce the visible lines, but the fragrance in it is way too overbearing. i don't really want to put perfume on my face :("
This product is truly anti wrinkle. It works better that expensive anti wrinkle cream I have used. The only complaint I have is its scent. I wish that there is an unscented choice.
"I started using Ponds Rejuveness about two weeks ago and am loving it...My dark circles and puffiness under my eyes is getting less noticeable, and the creases in my forehead and around my mouth are disappearing."
"Bought a travel size for a trip. First time using it. Soaked in fast not greasy,did not make my face itch. Going to use product to see if I want to invest in the full size. Will definitely purchase again for travel!!!"

I love all Ponds products. I however wish they would offer moisturizer with SPF. Otherwise so far so good. I have very sensitive skin and this is about the only product that doesn't burn my skin.
"Because my face is so sensitive and was a hot mess at the time I received this product ( for free to test and review for Influenster ) I decided to use it on my neck for the two week challenge. Normally, I don't use anything on my neck because it breaks out too! Can I just say that at age 53, I'm tired of breaking out already!!! Ugh... I'm happy to report that my neck did not break out as a result of using this product. Kudos to you PONDS! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Thanks to Influenster I received a complimentary jar of the POND'S® - Rejuveness Anti Wrinkle Cream. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and my skin is softer and brighter. I didn't notice much in the way of firmness but the wrinkles on my forehead did smooth out a bit. I am hoping with continued use more wrinkles will disappear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The fragrance in this cream is so unbelievably strong. I had to wash it off my face, it was too intense. I tried using it only on my collar bone area, and even that was too much. The scent doesn't fade - even after an entire day of wear. Everything else about this moisturizer is so lovely though - great ingredients, lovely consistency. Please make a version without any fragrance!"
"I swear...every time I use it, the lid ends up on the bathroom floor! I find the lid awkward in shape and difficult to hold on to. Other than that, this product has been a welcome addition to my otherwise typically prestige-only skincare routine this winter."
I really recommend ponds products. that's the best!
Dont really use as a anti wrinkle cream!! Use as a makeup remover only. Use when in a hurry.
Have been using this along with dark spot lotion from ponds faithfully for 2 months..I have NOT NOTICED any improvement in skin or spots..
