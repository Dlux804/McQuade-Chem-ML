"My wife is trying this cream, she is greatly impressed with producto, she says that this product leaves her skin smooth and it is getting flat and flat."
"I'm 38 and use this cream religiously. I use it at night after a shower (ensure all make up is removed). It's very thick and creamy so I prefer to apply it at night. It leaves my skin soft and luminous, and I've noticed my fine lines are smoother. Well worth $10!!!"
"So it takes 3 to 4 weeks to see results, it hasn't been that long for me. I will say this moisturizer has a soft scent and goes on like butter, so smooth. I love the way it feels on my face when applying from beginning to end. It is a day and night moisturizer I would say the only con about it, as a day moisturizer it doesn't have the SPF 15 in it."
"I have super sensitive skin, and I had a very negative reaction the first time I used it. My skin felt it was burning. I rinsed it off with cold water, but still had unpleasant feeling. Definitely not for those with super sensitive skin. I would not recommend it for those with super sensitive skin."
Use care with whatever you apply to your skin - you never know what will happen when it is absorbed.
I have only used this for maybe four days. But I have to say I already see a improvement. I was so surprised because I also see a change in my age or dark spots. I am really impressed.
"This moisturizer goes on nice and smooth, not too moist or dry-just the right consistency. I am pleasantly surprised at how much I like this. I have tried many moisturizers and did not yet have a favorite but now I do! My skin feels nice and smooth but not greasy. This does not contain a sunscreen as many moisturizers do but I am happy with that since I am not in the sun much anyway and can use a separate sunscreen when I am. I really prefer not to have an all in one product. Very pleased overall."
"This is my favorite moisturizer so far. I love the formula. Feels like a creamy gel like consistency. Its thick but doesn't leave you feeling greasy. I haven't been using long enough to say that I see a difference in firmness but I definitely do feel the difference in softness in my skin, feel alot more moisturized. When I dont use this I feel the difference. You do get alot of product in the jar. Try this!!!"
"L'Oreal Paris Wrinkle Expert 35+ Day/Night Moisturizer, 1.7 oz. Alittle bit of this really goes along way. After using this for awhile, I really am pleasantly surprised. I notice baby changes as for as fine lines and that's good enough for me. I will continue to use this."
"i love this cream, i see change in my skin"
"mostly used at night as it works while asleep. At light feel when applied without a greasy residue on the hands. Seems to do as described tightening the skin, but keeping it soft."
I use this moisturizer as a night cream if I want a break from using retinol for a few days. I like that it's inexpensive and it makes my skin hydrated and balanced. It's also lightweight when applied evenly after using a serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used L'oreal products for decades and this cream did not disappoint me. I used it the same day I received it. It's not greasy, it doesn't smell to perfumes or other additives, it goes on easily, it's non greasy. I'm very happy with this product."
I'm 35 almost 36 I've been using this occasionally for the past year. I figure it couldn't hurt anything. We all are gonna get older anyway so why not try and improve the process. It makes my face feel moisturized and I've been told I look like I'm in my 20's so it must be working lol.
"I am 30 y old. I use it for 3 months twice a day. smell good, no alergic reaction you feel the skin hydrated but not a significant wrinkle restoration. I'm going to try the loreal triple action set maybe that work for me. if you don't have visibles wrinkles maybe it can help you to prevent it."
This is a little to oily for my liking. Results are ok. Smells good. Good texture. Absorbs ok but leaves a but greasy feel. Would rrcomend it instead of using nothing else. And i wish it had spf.
"I bought this and it makes my skin feel so balanced . I have very oily skin, and using this my skin feels less oily than using my other oil- free moisturizer . I think I am going to commit to using this moisturizer for the benefit of anti aging and moisturizing"
"Been looking for a moisturizer that is not only quality but in my budget and this fits the bill. Has a lovely texture and leaves my skin feeling elluminated and smooth, lovely that i can use in the morning at before bed, i am very self conscious about aging (I'm 36), and I have been applying heavily around laugh lines and eye area and so far seems to show slight benefits after 3 days of use. Really excited i found this product as opposed to declour which was 10 times the price! Results exactly the same maybe even better!"
"I have used $80 moisturizers from the department store, this little $10 jar was surprisingly just as comparable, just as moisturizing, helped with skin tone and leaves a nice glow! It can leave a slight sheen but I only use this as a night cream as it has no spf and that's good because I prefer it that way anyways. I will definitely be buying this again thanks loreal and Walmart for this great product!"
I've been using this product for about a week. The moisturizer is light on the face a little amount goes a long way. I'm prone to acne and have oily skin and was afraid that it would make me breakout. Happy to report no breakouts. My face feels moisturized without feeling oily.
I have very sensitive skin but this product does not break me out. I have read the reviews where it makes your skin feel sticky or oily but honestly I have never had that problem. my jar has lasted me a very long time because you only use very little!!! I especially loved it before applying makeup. It helps your makeup go on so smoothly. I would recommend this to anyone.
My previous moisturizer was discontinued so I thought I would give this a try since Loreal has a good reputation. It was a definite disappointment. It has a greasy and stick feel to it that doesn't go away. My makeup which is a long lasting foundation couldn't even stay on. My face which is usually combination/dry was extremely oily by midday. I wasted my money on this product.
I LOVE this cream! It feels so amazing on my face. I have already bought a couple to give to my girlfriends because I love it so much. My face feels great and for sure I can see a different in fine lines and smoother skin.
I've been using this product for two weeks and I'm seeing a big difference in my fine lines love it I will recommend thus product for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First product that I have used in a long time that actually does what it says! Love this product. My skin looks and feels great.
I bought this a month ago and use twice daily. I have not seen any results. I will say that it is very smooth and is not greasy. The store did not have the cream for the age group of 45-54...
After Third time using this I noticed my cheeks are starting to peel and they look wrinkled because they are dry and red. I don't know what is in it that is doing this to me but I have used another product from a well known company months ago and similair thing happened. That was also a moisturizer for aging skin.
I bought 2 times. A good moisturizer but not at giving results to your face.
"This cream is great, but just not for me. It goes in smooth, feel the moisture instantly. But it's like adding a whole layer of something to my face. Too heavy for me, too greasy. Makes my face shiny. It takes me washing my face 2 or 3 times the next morning to remove it all after applying the night before. I'm 35, and thought I'd try it since it's tailored to ladies my age. Would I recommend? I'd tell people I know to try it, but that its too heavy to be my cup of tea. I'll keep looking for the perfect moisturizer."
I've been using this for about 2 weeks. It makes my skin soft and doesn't break me out.
This cream is excellent. It is not greasy and has no mineral oil so it feels light. I'm a guy and I love this.
I used this product for the first time this morning. It's way too greasy to use under makeup!! I will either return it or just use it at night only.
Smells pretty good but not recommended for oily skin.
