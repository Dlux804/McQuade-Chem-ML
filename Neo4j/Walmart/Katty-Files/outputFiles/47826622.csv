This moisturizer works very well. It absorbs into my skin and is non greasy. I use it at least once a day to keep my skin looking and feeling good. It is very important to take care of facial skin as it ages and this product does what it says. I have used other L'Oreal products for hair care as well and I have never had any complaints about the product. It is high quality and does what it advertises.
I am really glad I decided to try L'Oreal Paris Wrinkle Expert 55+ Day/Night Moisturizer.
"First of all, I love the convenience to wear it Day/Night. Second, It gently moisturizes my skin without adding extra oils and it cleared my complexion in less than a week. Finally, it is the right cream for my age, which I have learned is really important."
"Very nice texture, slight aroma but pleasant, makes my old skin feel soft and does not look as wrinkled, non greasy...I am glad I found this product"
I have been using the Loreal 55+ moisturizer for about three weeks now and do not intend to stop. My deep wrinkles are smoother and my neck sagging is much improved. I wish I had taken a before picture to show what this product has done for me. Plus it is affordable Thank you Loreal.
"I love this product and have bought it again from Walmart. It is easy to apply and you don't even notice it on you face. Some products make you feel like you have something greasy on your face. This does not. I would and have recommended this product,"
"I do love the feel of this, its light and it does a wonderful job on moisturizing my skin, it just feels wonderful! The only drawback, for me, is the scent. I don't care for scents at all, and this does have a distinct scent. almost like a perfume. So yes, Id definitely recommend it, but not if you dont care for scented products."
"It's a great moisturizer cream, I've only used it for 2 weeks so don't know if my wrinkles have improved. I like the fact that I can use it both day and night and don't have to buy seperat creams."
I love this moisturizer. My skin loves it too. It has a nice consistency without looking or feeling greasy. It's great by itself or under makeup. I use it day
"Love L'Oreal and love this moisturizer. I am 67 and have a difficult time finding wrinkle creams that don't emphasize my deep wrinkles. This moisturizer actually make them look smoother. It's silky and feels light on my skin but moisturizes really well. Under makeup, it looks like I have on primer. It actually feels like moisturizer with primer. Being on a retirement budget it is very affordable. I also love all of the Age Perfect line, especially the new cleanser which is awesome. Please don't discontinue."
"I had been using this for about a month and noticed a nice difference in my skin. In preparation for cataract surgery, I had to stop using all makeup and even my moisturizer. (directions from the dr. so that no cream would work it's way into the eye) My skin is so dry it hurts if I don't use moisturizer but this wrinkle expert 55+ allowed me to go for 4 days with no moisturizer and still felt soft!"
"I bought this product as a day cream. It has a lovely texture and fragrance. It is almost a gel like quality to it. The only part that was disappointing was that I couldn't use it under makeup as it seems to ""pill"" It would be better as a night cream."
"My face really like this product. I donât break out in rash or hives!! Yay! It smooth, refreshes my face"
Have been using this product for 2 weeks now and I can see a difference on my neck area. Looking smoother.
I bought this for some fine lines I have on my forehead. Smells nice and when you put it on it almost feels like it is working however it has done absolutely nothing..has not made on tiny bit of difference.
The most impressive wrinkle cream I have ever used. Is great on my sensitive skin and I really do look younger. Can't belive something this well price works so well
I loved that I could choose a product targeted to my age and needs. What I used at 20 isn't suitable at 50+ and I appreciate knowing I'm getting quality skincare at such affordable pricing.
Reasonably priced for such a versatile product. Day and night in one product is super convenient and my skin totally appreciates it too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used many anti-winkle products that did not work. I thought I would try L'Oreal Paris Wrinkle Repair. I have great results with this product. My winkles are going away. I recommend this product.
The L'Oreal Wrinkle Expert moisturizer is wonderful! I've been using it about two weeks and can see a dramatic difference in my complexion. My face is smoother and has a glow! I'll never be without it!
"It's creamy and goes on smoothly, good product."
gives a beautiful glow....smooth and absorbent...I use day and night
cream feels nice and silky
"Leaves skin nice and smooth, helps to get rid those little wrinkles."
"This is just what my mom had been looking for. It's a little heavier than her other face lotions, but not greasy. Just what she wanted."
Just wanted to find out why all the chemical ingredients in your products? Are they really necessary to have 30 or more chemicals??
Love the eye cream (it's not scented) but the scent of the moisturizer is terrible...smells like cheap perfume and way too strong.
I use every day this product is so good I have told friends about it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Goes on with a Cool Feel, not to thick, tightens skin I'm 63. I wish it had sunscreen in it. I rated it a 4 only because it's heavily scented with a cheap perfume smell but it feels good."
I love the way it feels and it smells great too Perfect for my dry skin
"I like the way it goes on. Not sure it helps my wrinkles, but it is a good moisturizer."
Feels great.
love it
"after many years with clinique and then acouple with philosophy,i needed a change as i was breaking out. so i found this in expensive moisturizer and said lets try this. well i am very happy after one month.break outs are clearing,soft and smooth skin is the result and the price is a fraction. at night twice a week i use a retenol and its all working together. i will purchase again."
This smells great but that is about it! I have almost finished the jar and have used it religiously morning and night ( well I may have missed a day here and there periodically) left my skin greasy in some spots making for foundation to not look even in the morning. Bought it because of the price and easy to find locally. My opinion spend a lil extra money buy something else.
i have used this products for many years and i am over 90 years old and will
til i die
I bought for the wrinkles yet no results but may be soon i will post the results
"Highly recommend this product. It is wonderful, and makes my skin feel softer."
very moist and creamy. it helps my eye area look smooth.
It smells good...don't know yet if it works on wrinkles.
"I noticed when rubbing my skin after putting the lotion on it was like a peeling of the skin,like getting out of the shower and rubbing your skin when you have been sunburned.It just rolled up so is your skin suppose to peel with this lotion?But it does make the skin soft."
"Nice delicate fragrance, light moisturizing fee on my face and neckl."
"Noticed improvement in my skin after a week. Skin looked brighter and less wrinkles. Skin is smoother, younger. I also increased my water intake, which, in my case, aids in the effectiveness of the creme"
"I haven't been using this long enough to see any changes, but I have to say, I love this cream! It feels better than any I have tried. It is so soft and smooth. Whether I see difference or not, I will continue to use this. I love it!"
"Shortly after I started using this moisture cream, my chin area broke out with little yellow bumps. Eeeek. I stopped using it and they went away. I returned it to the local Walmart."
This moisturizer is perfect for my skin because it is not too oily and doesn't make me shine. (I prefer a matte look).
cream is so smooth and light nice smell and i have to see if it does what it says just started using it but its a keeper
It applied easily and did not irritate my skin. People kept telling me how nice I looked.
I like L'Oreal products.
