"I received a sample of the Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer in something ordered from Walmart, used it and went to Walmart and purchased it today. I could see a difference in my skin within 2 days [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried a sample Clearly Brighter by way of Walgreens and I'd definitely buy it! Aside from the SPF that should be higher than 15, I love that it's lightweight and has a lovely citrusy scent. it's like vitamin C in moisturizer form! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Got this as a sample and it's amazing I wear it when I get up in the morning after I wash my face. I will be purchasing the entire kit. Can't wait to see if the rest is as refreshing as the moisturizer. What caught my eye was that it has sunscreen which is much needed in this summer weather. Will be giving a review on the other products once I purchase them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Hi ,my name is Karianne and I do whatever I can to keep my face clear and healthy .So I got clearly brighter as a sample and I thought to myself it going to just leave my face oily .The thing is it didn't clearly brighter works so good .My friends keep asking me how I keep my face so clear and I told them and they were like we have to got some that . Normally I don't fill out surveys ,but this time I am because this product is amazing .Two thumbs up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE this product! It has enough SPF for daily use, it is lightweight, but moisturizing, and best of all, my skin looks amazing after one week! I have actually stopped using foundation all-over my face and have gotten compliments on how great my skin looks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how smoothly this slides across my face and how hydrated and nourished my skin feels after use. It lasts all day, too. I use it before my make up because it helps my makeup go on better and really makes a difference in the way my foundation looks. I've used other moisturizers before my makeup before but this is by far the best."
Absorbs into skin quickly and leaves your face with a glowing complextion. Doesn't add oil or cause breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was so surprised at how much I liked this product. First off, it smells amazing. Second, it really does brighten your skin. Just after using it every day for 7 days, my skin was clearer and brighter. I would definitely recommend this product to friends who like drug store skin care products."
"So tried this Garnier moisturizer given to me by Allure Beauty Enthusiasts & Garnier for review for the 7 days once a day every morning! Noticed right away after day 3 the more even skin tone, subtle glow & smoother skin! I love how light it is and how it protects my skin! This is definitely my new favorite moisturizer!! #GarnierSkinActive #AllureBeautyEnthusiasts"
"I have been using this moisturizer for about 2 years and haven't wanted to use anything else! It is light and airy, and keeps my skin looking bright and blemish free! Without this product, my skin looks bumpy and I start to break out a little more. I decided to write a review because this is a moisturizer I really love and hope I never have to go without!"
"I don't want nor like the smell of sunscreen on my face. My makeup has sunscreen, cant tell it. This I can tell. It smells and feels like I am putting sunscreen on my face. I bought it because of the Vitamin C and brightening properties but I really don't think there is much of that in there. I think it is mainly sunscreen. I wear powder foundation and it effects the way my brush works with my foundation. I wont purchase again unless I can find it with no sunscreen and give that a shot."
My skin feels so great and revitalized. I did not notice a change in the brightness or tone buy the product is definitely amazing!
"I bought this on a whim, and it was the best purchase I've ever made for my skin. I had really bad acne in my forehead which resulted in horrible scars. This product really helped get rid of those dark spots, it smells great and it has SPF which is a total win! I've told 3 of my girlfriends to buy it and they all love it. I love it so much that I repurchased it. I'm really looking forward to trying more things from this line!"
I received a sample with a purchase I made from ULTA. I love it! It made my skin smooth and added a nice glow. Will most definitely be going to purchase a full size. It's amazing and works well under makeup which is a plus for me!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got a sample of this with my micellar water and became obsessed. I've been using for about a month and ended up buying the full product. I have oily/combination skin and it leaves my skin really hydrated without being greasy. It really brightened up my skin and gives me a healthy glow. It minimized my breakouts and feels so fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My son came home from college and brought this with him, he told me to try it and I have been using it since September and there has been a dramatic change for the good in our skins appearance. I am 60 yrs old and it has made me extremely happy to use it in my daily routine. I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL AGES"
"I tried this this morning and OMG it made my skin softer on the spot! I have dry cheeks and jaw line like super scaly and after my morning exfoliation, applied a coat and loved how soft and non-greasy it made my face. I'm definitely will be using more of this product."
"I was fortunate enough to get this product as part of a CROWDTAP challenge. Otherwise, I might never have tried it and that would have been sad. I LOVE this product. I have been using it faithfully since I first got the sample bottle and people have commented on how much younger I look and have even asked me what I am doing differently. You can bet I will continue to use this product. My skin looks and feels better and I love the fresh clean smell."
I Love it. It moisturizers but doesnlt leave an oily residue. I feel like it doesn't clog up more nearly as bad as other products I have tried. I recieved a little sample in the mail to try. And I loved it. Great Product. I will be buying some of this for myself!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love that it's oil free because it is easier to apply it on my face. It hydrated and nourished my skin right before I applied my makeup. I am not a makeup expert but I found that my makeup can last longer when I used it as my moisturizer. I also like how the foundation blended with it. I'll probably use this more as a makeup base than as a daily moisturizer because of this discovery.
"I recieved a sample of this in the mail, and it actually exceeded my expectations. On my 5th day of using it I could already see how great is was working with my skin, it felt rejuvenated and had a gorgeous glow to it. Would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as a sample in a magazine and couldn't wait to try it out. Firstly, it's nice to receive a sample that is ample size - there is plenty to cover your face for a couple of days. I loved the way it smells fresh and is so light on your skin - soaks in straight away. I will definitely be buying this when next at the store. 5/5!"
"I recieved a sample in the mail. Loved it so much, I made a trip to the store just to pick it up for the next morning. Loved it! It feels much better on my skin than a name brand moisturizer that I have been using for at least 10 years or more....I'm hooked [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"ABSOLUTELY LOVE! It has everything all in one...it instantly smooths my skin, hydrates my complexion, lightens my acne scars, and has SPF! Amazing product that I'm telling my friends all about! I wish the bottle would come a little larger and a little more affordable, but I guess I'm getting a good deal for all it does for me :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the sample I got in the store . I like the texture and the scent. I t really works immediately . I am a 50+ women with fair skin and I tend to get some redness on my cheeks. It evens out my skin tone. I wish it had a higher spf because I live in Florida [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the smell and the lightness of this product. I hesitate to try new products because of the outcome of heavy product that makes my face break out. The fact that this product evened out my face and made my skin look fresh has made me a admirer of this product line. I look forward to trying other products within the Garnier skincare line.
I recieved a free sample of this product and have used it ever since. It is not greasy and my skin at 60 is in good condition. I need the spf in it as well. I use it day and night. You do not even feel it on your skin it is so light but effects are noticable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample and decided to give it a try. Loved the feel on my face, make my skin look brighter and was not oily. Bonus was the billt in sunscreen I highly recommend this product as it both protects and sooths. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product! It works really well. Makes my skin feel refreshed and looking really healthy and beautiful:)
"I am 68 years old and never had any compliments on my skin (as a teenager, I had acne). I have been using this Garnier product for several months and have been told that my skin is ""luminous"". Great product, highly recommend."
I've been using this for two years and absolutely love it. It makes my skin glow and it goes on very smooth. I have combination skin and it's not too drying or oily it's just right. But more recently it's been difficult to find in nearby stores.
I received a sample in one of my magazines and I have to say I love this very much! Will definitely buy it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a sample and tried used it as my night cream. Left my skin feeling refreshed and clean. Goes on smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got a sample of this in the mail and I love the way it makes my skin feel. My skin is smoother, brighter and has a more even tone. Very nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the sample I received and really like the way my skin feels and looks. I did not like the fragrance however. It smelled too much like perfume. Is there a fragrance-free version of this product? If not, perhaps there should be."
"Anything with the word ""Brightening"" on it, I stay away from due to my oily skin. But this is amazing to my face! Left it so soft and incredibly bright and kept my oil at bay. I love this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this as a sample in my Pinch Me box and it is absolutely amazing. I want to use it every day! It feels so light and has an amazing smell. You have got to try it out!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Besides the great citrusy smell, this is great for my skin. Very refreshing. Will be part of my daily routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this product. It is as described and not oily.
"I was out looking for a new moisturizer. I had used Aveeno for years, but for whatever reason after having my baby in January it was causing me to breakout! I wanted something to give me a glow, even without makeup. This product did just that. It was about a week when I started noticing. I have never felt very comfortable without makeup, but I do now. its helped with evening and brightening. I also have used it over my red stretch marks and they have faded VERY quickly. (: This product is amazing."
"I've been enjoying a sample of Clearly Brighter for a week, and am already noticing a more evenly mositurized skin. I love that it's not too oily, and doesn't result in a shiny face. So far, my often sensitive skin is very receptive to this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is hands down the best daily facial moisturizer I have ever used. Before buying this product, I had never used a moisturizer on my face before, so I wasn't really sure what to expect. It is so light and creamy, it glides on the skin very smoothly, and doesn't leave it feeling greasy. It also absorbs into the skin very quickly, and after only using it a few times, I could already notice a difference in my skin. Would highly recommend this product!!"
I like this product because you don't need a separate sunscreen and moisturizer. This lotion gets the job done in one step. It is great under makeup and it doesn't 'pill' like some products do when I apply my foundation. The scent is light and fresh so I don't think it will bother sensitive noses. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love the feel of this moisturizer, it absorbs quickly and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy like many sunblocks do. However the scent is so strong it makes me sneeze and is aggravating to my eyes. I wouldn't recommend this product if you have sensitive skin or are irritated by perfumes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer absorbs very quickly, has no residue left after the application and smells wonderfully. One draw-back is the low SP factor. Time will show if it visibly brightens my skin. I am OK with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been looking for something that would diminish my scars and make my Casper the Friendly Ghost-like skin look radiant (not SCARY) for YEARS... and here it FINALLY is! Not only is this moisturizer MUCH less harsh than the glycolic acid peels & toners I'd been trying for the past few months, but it even makes my pores look smaller PLUS it has SPF!!! Thank You, Garnier! Everything I wanted in a nourishing & brightening moisturizer in ONE bottle--my dreams have FINALLY come true!"
"I love this product! I'very used it f8r several days now. The consistency is light, yet it does a great job mositurizing. I skin feels baby soft, more smooth, and just all around great! The scent is soft and pleasant. I cannot believe how great my skin feels, I will be purchasing the full size soon!"
im a beauty advisor been using 2 weeks and its the best hands down skin looks and feels soft and glowy..
I received a sample I love it I recommend to all my friends [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a sample and now it is part of my daily routine! I would really recommend to someone who is looking for a new face moisturizer
"Fabulous product. It melts into your skin, making it smooth and youthful. Love, love love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Balances the oils in my face and definitely brightens my tone! Absolutely love it! Buying more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used the coupon and tried Clearly Brighter. My skin felt smooth and polished, great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got a sample in my Fabletics package. Really like the lightweight, absorbable moisture unlike many similar products with sunscreen. Definitely easy to use every day, all seasons, rain or shine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This fast became my favorite moisturizer, easy to use, with continued use, it has diminished my sun spots, which I love!!! I love the smell as well! Many thanks to Allure for the free sample! #GarnierSkinActive #AllureBeautyEnthusiasts"
I love this product. I have combination skin and this is great! I'm a forty one year old mom and my age is really starting to show...so far this mortified has been my saving grace. I love the light feel and the mild scent. Thank you!!
Good product
"This product is wonderful! Immediately, my skin felt bright, soft, and smooth even in the middle of a cold winter month!!. I have large pores and Clearly Brighter reduced the size of them right away. And the best part is that it was gentle on my sensitive skin!! LOVE! My only personal wish is that it was slightly more creamy, but that could be because it is winter. But otherwise, I love it!! Good job Garnier!!"
"I got a sample of this to try from one of my magazines. I liked how easy it absorbed into my skin, and it felt light upon application. The citrus smell was a little strong for me, but pleasant. I wish it was more orange smelling than lemon, since the stronger lemon scent made it seem like I was applying a kitchen cleaner to my face, but that is also a personal preference (I don't like lemon smelling things)."
"I received a sample of the clearly brighter and am impressed! While I didn't have enough to use for an entire week, I loved how light and non greasy this was and how quickly it absorbed into my skin. I will be purchasing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as a sample and figured I would try it out since my skin gets so dry around this time of the year. I am SHOCKED at how smooth and nourished my skin feels after a few days of applying this after my shower. Seriously, I love this product!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I actually used the little trial packet that I got in my magazine and after a shower I decided to put it on so I'd have fresh clean skin...within minutes my face felt clean and fresh and smooth. I will definitely be buying to full size product along with looking at all the other Garnier skin active products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"To be honest this was my first time using a Garnier product. I was utterly amazed by how it performed. It was silky, smooth and felt clean going on my face. To know it also had sunscreen and was oil-free was a bonus. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and continue to use it as part of my daily beauty regime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a free sample from pinchme and After a few days of use my skin is more even toned its softer and brighter it doesn't leave your face feeling sticky. I love it! As soon as I run out I'm running to buy a bottle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Found a sample in a magazine, and decided to try it out...who wouldn't want brighter skin? I got two uses out of the sample, and I was impressed by how soft my face and neck were. Did not see any change in the brightness of my skin, but maybe with more product, I will!"
I absolutely loved this moisturizer! I was a little skeptical at first because I usually use very expensive facial products but this moisturizer is affordable and the quality is amazing. I love that it helps even and brighten my skin tone as well as have spf 15. The smell of it is also quite pleasant. Will definitely recommend this product.
The results I noticed from a small sample mirrored the light silky feeling of putting this on my face! My face felt fresh and rejuvenated and this was just within a couple of days. The smell of this product also made me excited to use it. Nothing better than hitting so many senses in a positive way FIRST thing in the morning! I loved this and plan on making my first purchase of it when I get to the store!
"I previously bought the Garnier SkinActive in a fragrance free bottle. I tried the Clearly Brighter, and I loved the smell! It's really fresh and doesn't smell like sunscreen at all. Once it is on, it takes about 4-5 minutes before my skin is feeling smooth and clean. It doesn't feel like a sunscreen even though it has SPF 15 in it. I am definitely going to get more!"
This is the first moisturizer to not irritate my skin. My skin is oily so when ever i use anything on it it just feels like it sits there. This product is light wheight and absorbs into my skin no problem. Love that it has sunscreen since i live where its always sunny.
"I've only tried this as a sample for two days and I see the difference. It's not a super dramatic one but for only two days, I'm impressed. My skin soaked it right up and it's not heavy nor greasy. This is like an energy drink for my face. It's brighter and I look alive. I also use the BB cream after and my skin looks great."
I received a free sample through Crowdtap. And I am happy that I did. I liked the fact that this product has sunscreen in it and helps my skin become an even tone. Which I need as I am getting older. Can't wait to see the improvement in a week. Thanks for the all in one. It isn't greasy or anything.
"Smells good, goes on smooth makes my face feel good."
I love the way my skin feels after using this product. No more dry tight skin.
"I really like this product, It is a great moisturizer and I can feel it working!"
Received on 5/20/19. Shows expired on 04/19. They should not sell expired products. Disappointing.
"A little above my budget, but it doesn't irritate my skin or make it oily! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Good product! Absorbs quickly. I tried the sample I got from magazine. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I have been using this product for two weeks now and absolutely love it. It leaves my skin smooth and radiant. I would highly recommend this product.
I only got the small sample and i put a little on my face and it feels like a baby's butt its so soft i love it my face has never felt this good. Im not going to wear makeup today because of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I Got A Sample Of The Daily Mosturizer & Fell In Love With It . I Got Great Results Within A Week ! Doesn't Leave My Skin Oily , My Skin Tone Appears More Even , & My Face Just Looks Very Healthy ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I am 57 years young and have used Clearly Brighter for over 3 months.
I could not be more satisfied with the product.
My skin is soft and almost perfectly smooth for a lady of my age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love this product. It feels great and spreads evenly on my skin. Friends my age have been complimenting me on how my face looks and of course I have to share my new found friend - Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter.
"I could not recommend this product. I applied to my face and immediately felt a burning sensation. I have sensitive skin, so this product is not for me."
"I got a sample of this and used it and loved the results that I got. I used the coupon that came with the sample to buy a full size bottle and I am very pleased so far. My skin looks brighter, clearer, and smoother than it has in a very long time."
"this product feels good on face, unfortunately, the active ingredient is not recommended if you are using it for the purpose of SFP. There's no zinc oxcide and titanium as the first ingredients."
I used the sample was very impressed went to the store to buy it and the price of extremely to high for me Will definitely have to wait until it's on sale with a coupon attached would like the dark circle corrector as well but all the products seem to be a little bit pricey for my budget overall the clearly brighter skin was obtainable so I would love to see the results for the dark circle product but truly I can't afford it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought this product along with the tinted moisturizer, under eye roller, and face wash. I've used the previous bb cream and other products in my daily makeup routine, but when I decided to upgrade to these new and improved products, after a few days of wearing, my face is completely broken out :( I loved the old moisturizer and bb cream, but sadly this one made my skin red and blotchy."
"From what I can tell on my fairer skin, this sunscreen doesn't leave a white cast. It does absorb but still leaves skin oily and does give me a few whiteheads. Under my makeup it gives me a dewey look (I have dry skin). Has a chemically, floral scent which I have also experienced with garniers bb cream that i do NOT enjoy. Burns my eyes a little if i apply to my bags. I prefer the Neutrogena ultra sheer dry touch sunscreen but will use up my sample of this."
"I really like this moisturizer because it keeps my face protected in my day to day life. The spf 15 isn't much, but since I work a desk job, it is just fine. It has a really nice light scent, and absorbs quickly into my skin. I keep an spf 50 on hand for longer periods of time outside because I am very pale and burn easily. I have had no issues with this product."
"This moisturizer is great! It has good texture and absorbs quickly, so I don't have greasy feeling on my face. Besides it has very pleasant scent. What I also appreciate is that it has SPF to protect my skin during the day. Overall, I have a very positive experience with the product and would definitely buy a full size. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall, I liked the product. I didn't love the smell of the product. It smelled like old people lotion. It did do a good job of keeping my skin moisturized, and worked just as well as my current product that I've been using for 10 years. I would consider purchasing this if it had a different smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very nice and light weight moisturizer. Once dry it feels like nothing is there which I love. I even wear this at night after I wash my face because it is the right balance of moisture. So far, it hasn't upset my skin at all so that's a plus as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wanted to love this so bad but it let me down! It dried out my normally oily skin way tooooooo much!! It is very mattifying which makes my face flake and putting on makeup a nightmare. I had to rewash my face and put on my normal face moisturizer, because the Garnier one was awful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ii did try clearly brighter moisturizer i broke out not sure if it was because of my skin type or age hitting 40 and have it all peach fuzz frown lines crows feet dry patches discoloration even achne and bothe oily and dry skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I already own a slightly different kind of Garnier facial moisturizer so I was excited to try something a little different while knowing it wouldn't give me a bad reaction or anything. I even gave it to my husband after he came home with a really bad sunburn, and it worked really well for him even when he was peeling. I don't use moisturizer as often as I should, but I'm really happy that this is a good size sample because I can take it with me on my upcoming trip :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product,"" clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer "" is a good moisturizer that has some sun protection built in with it. I have used the sample and have noticed brighter and smoother skin. I would recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I been exploring Garnier's products, so I was happy to receive a sample of Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15. With Summer here we need to use a sunscreen. Garnier gives us this and adds in a moisturizer too. I found the moisturizer to be refreshing creamy and left my skin smooth. I would recommend this Garnier's product to buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this moisturizer. It is lightweight and feels very smooth and silky on the face, probably because of the silicone (dimethicone) in it. It also wears nice under makeup. The only thing I did not care for that much is the fragrance, but at least it does not smell like sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this moisturizer a lot. It is easy to apply, smells nice, and keeps my skin moisturized and free from daily sun damage. I will definitely buy it when this sample runs out. Nice product for everyday use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I never use moisturizer because I've had bad reactions to it, but I absolutely love this product. My skin is sensitive and great but it felt clear and weightless on my face. I love how it has spf in it too! I will absolutely purchase the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product claims to be a moisturizer but it's really just sunscreen. It's sunscreen that doesn't dry out your skin. There is so much fragrance in the product to mask the sunscreen odors that it was nauseating. You cannot apply to eye area just like sunscreen. I can apply my own moisturizer to the eye area, which also needs moisturizing. Product is incorrectly named. Market product as only sunscreen and not a daily moisturizer. Also, fix the fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is definitely one of my favorites for the summer. I love that it has spf in it for those days that I am just running out to the store or riding in the car. I feel good knowing that I still have some protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this product very reluctantly since I don't like to put heavy moisturizers and creams on my face. I was surprised at how smooth my skin felt after I applied it. Within days, I noticed a difference in my skin. It looks much fresher than normal without any residue. I love this product and highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was skeptical when I first tried product because I have dry skin due to menopause I guess. Wow, was I surprised hoe nice it went on, the smell is great, you do not need to use that much, a little goes a long way! I have been using it everyday and I do plan on Purchasing it when it is all gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did like this moisturizer, but my skin has been extra dry lately and this didn't quite cut it for me. I really enjoyed the smell and the product felt really nice to put on. Unfortunately it wasn't enough for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked what i was able to use in my sample but i wasnt able to see any positive efeects because there wasnt enough to judge on. I however liked what i saw and will be purchasing a bigger bottle to be able to thoroughly see how my skin reacts over time [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love a good moisturizer and it has SPF 15 I am sold. The Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisterizer SPF 15 is so worth it. even the sample size is perfect. so silky. Doesn't clog up my pores. i barely feel it but I've been out all summer and my skin hasn't burned and my skin feels supple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When summer rolls around I am attracted to anything that glows!! This lotion doesn't disappoint, it makes me skin look radiant without being glittery or sparkly. I have used this almost every day this summer so far and love the way it makes my skin look, the smell (not really one) and the non greasy finish. Perfect everyday lotion that helps to protect your skin is a winner in my book! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Its a great product but i have never been loyal to any beauty regimen. I always end up buying products and they end up under my bathroom sink and i throw them out when i need the space. But i liked how it made my skin feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the smell of the product but after using it I felt like my skin felt like it had more oil than normal. Also I would like it if it had a higher spf at least 30.So since I do want to use a moisturizer I don't want one to cause my skin to break out more from oil. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"There are so many different products that make the same claims so at first I thought this was just another one of those. I noticed immediately after applying to my face and before I put my makeup on that my skin felt smoother which helped with the makeup process. Also, the SPF is an added bonus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried various products over the years, as my skin's needs have changed. I had tried a few Garnier products, but not this particular one, so I was interested to see how it worked. I enjoyed my trial, and plan to purchase it. I am looking forward to seeing what the long term effects of this product are, and I'm hopeful to see a change in the overall appearance of my skin and evenness of tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Smells a little like sunscreen but that doesn't bother me. I feel like it keeps my skin moisturized for a long time throughout the day. I like it and would probably buy it again but I will say that it burned really bad if it happened to get in my eyes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i like that this product corrects and prevents. the spf will help stop me from getting more dark spots i get alot of freckles especially during the summer and it will even out the ones i already have! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great moisturizer, I have been suffering from dry skin on my face lately, and this product really helped me out! I used this for a couple days and I could really tell a difference. No more dry skin around my nose and chin! I was really pleased! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using a competing facial moisturizer for years, but I may finally have to switch. The Garnier is lighter and wears better under my makeup. Have not broken out yet, either. Seriously considering a change! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was currently liking the Aveeno facial lotion I was using. Until I tried this anyways. My skin feels so good after applying this. So soft and so bright, a lot of the days I use this i do not even apply makeup. It also provides so sun protection which is very important. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The very first thing that caught my attention with this product was the smell. It was powdery and sweet like other moisturizers, but citrusy and refreshing. Also, it did not leave my skin feeling greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product worked well. It didnt break me out or cause any other skin problems. A little went a long way so that was nice. I just didnt like the smell it was really strong and flowery and I dont like scents like that in my face products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It felt fine on my face until I went in the sun, after which my face started to sting a little bit. It was enough to feel uncomfortable. I'm glad I used a sample and didn't waste my money on this product. Also note that it has a pretty strong fragrance, which may have been what caused a reaction on my skin. I wouldn't recommend this moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Maybe it is me but I believe I saw a difference right away, MY skin seems brighter and I am looking for this in store to try long term. NO dry spots on my face and not oiled up either. No real sun exposure to comment on its effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked that this moisturizer/sunscreen was rather lightweight. I was expecting it to be greasy, but it was fine on my oily skin! It smells really nice and primes makeup just fine. I just wish it were cheaper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i am always looking for new products to help with my dry skin and this really helped. my face felt smooth and radiant but since i ran out my face seems dryer than it was when i started using again. this could be related to other environmental factors not just the use of the moisturizer. i hope to be able to purchase soon [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter SPF15 is a lightweight daily moisturizer. Doesn't feel think or cake. It's perfect for under makeup. Goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. I wish it had more SPF but at least it has some. The smell was a little too strong for my taste but has a pleasant smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was really excited to try this before I bought it! Clearly brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer SPF 15 is a really nice daily moisturizer with the added bonus of an SPF. I used the product twice a day for about 5 days with little difference noted in the ""brightness"" of my face. I would recommend this product as a good moisturizer without the high price you often find with other facial moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My CLEARLY BRIGHTER BRIGHTENING & SMOOTHING DAILY MOISTURIZER SPF 15 experience has been amazing! I've been using this product for the past few weeks and I've seen noticeable changes. I also love that it has SPF 15 so I don't have to lather on an extra layer of sunscreen over my face. Thanks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this product and the fact that it is a lotion and sunscreen combined. It isn't sticky like sunscreen but I still feel good about putting it on when I know I will be outside some during the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed this moisturizer very much. I used it several days in a row. It has a light scent that fades after about an hour. I used it under makeup after letting it sink in, and had no issues. I really felt it made my skin very smooth. I'm not sure about brightening since that's not an issue I have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried other daily moisturizer but nothing like this one. Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer has a very good smell and left my skin so smooth. I couldn't keep my hands off my face it was so smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the way my skin felt after using this, it was not greasy like other moisturizers. I just am not sure if I want to continue using this product. I would need to keep testing it to see if it's something I'd like to use long term. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturize with spf 15 is wonderful. It is light feeling, not greasy at all. Absorbs right into skin. Skin looks brighter, smoother and flawless. I have not had to wear much make up since using this moisturizer, just a bit of blush. I have gotten many compliments on my skin. I will absolutely purchase this!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed this moisturizer. The smell was pleasant and the feel was smooth yet not oily. I really liked that it had a SPF in it as well. The only reason I would not buy this is because I use an anti aging moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have rosacea on my cheeks and they cause my skin to feel and appear super dry. It's also super sensitive to creams and moisturizer but this product made my skin feel smooth and did not irritate my rosacea. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am extremely picky about what products i use on my face and i'm just too used to what i currently use to consider this product. Why fix what isn't broken. That said had i seen vast improvement i would have switched over but i didn't. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer seemed like just another moisturizer to me. The smell was pleasant, it felt nice on the skin, but it did make me feel oily by the end of the day. It didn't have any properties I found revolutionary or amazing. Perhaps this is a moisturizer that would show results over a longer period of time. But, the sample I received did not have enough for me to prove or dis-prove that theory. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product went on nicely and smelled fresh. I don't think the sample size allows for a (for me personally) ""brightening"" of skin. Possibly with a larger container it might. It is a product I might consider purchasing in the future when my current product is depleted. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this every morning since I received it. I like it because it's thin and doesn't feel greasy, I can put it on right under my makeup, and I have very pale skin so I love that it's spf 15. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm super picky about facial moisturizers. My skin can be reactive and I don't like anything that feels tacky, plus it's got to be a pretty intense moisturizer to keep up with my dryness. The CLEARLY BRIGHTER BRIGHTENING & SMOOTHING DAILY MOISTURIZER SPF 15 is my new favorite moisturizer! The SPF does it's job well, the moisture level is just right and there's no strange feeling on my skin after I apply it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love all Garnier products, however, I've switched to something higher end for my daily skincare regimen. I would otherwise purchase this. I still have the sample though and it works well paired with the BB cream on hot summer days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love neutrogena and have never been disappointed by any product they've come out with. I really thoroughly enjoyed this product and am looking forward to using it more when outdoors. It made my skin feel so smooth and improved and really helped my makeup glide on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked that this is a moisturizer and sunscreen in one. I also like that it didn't make me break out, which has happened with other sunscreens I've used in the past. It didn't leave white smudges either, which is awesome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer makes my skin so soft without leaving a greasy or heavy residue on its surface. Once applied, it quickly sinks in. While I didn't notice any skin brightening from it, the softness along with the SPF 15 in it make it worth buying because I can feel secure in my skin being taken care of. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am VERY fair and very Irish, so I burn easily. I'm also lazy about skincare so if I'm going to put on moisturizer with sunscreen, I want more spf than 15. I don't want to have to add a sunscreen on top of that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer. I liked the fact it contains broad spectrum spf 15 and that it is oil free. I also liked that it contained antioxidants vitamins c and lha. It is a great product and I plan to purchase it soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have extremely sensitive skin so I am glad this product did not break me out, has spent to protect my skin, evened out my skin tone, smells good, and glides on smoothly and absorbs well and quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I felt that this was a good moisturizer. It did the job, but I really just prefer the face lotions I currently use (coconut oil, Eucerin). The scent was nice and it seemed to leave my skin feeling good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked it but really prefer a higher SPF than 15. That means I still need to add sunscreen on top of this moisturizer even if I'm only driving somewhere during the day. That's really my only complaint in regard to this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After using the sample I thought it was pretty good but there just wasn't enough to actually know for sure. Sometimes I buy something that works initially and then kind of putters out...and considering the change in the season too- maybe it just worked better in Spring because I wasn't sweating it off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been trying to use all natural moisturizers like olive oil for a few weeks now but they don't provide me with the protection I need from the sun. And so I was eager to try out this product and see how well it worked out for my sensitive face. I loved it. It is probably my favorite product in the entire sample box. It was light and didnt weigh my face down one bit. I really enjoyed using this product so much that I went out and purchased my very own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is good after my pregnancy I have some dark spots on my face even that sample was not enough to see if produtc works I took the risk And I bought the product and I see the diference now after some weeks of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked the way the moisturizer felt and the fact that it has spf was a plus. My issue was with the scent of the product. I felt like I smelled like a flower all over. I would recommend it to someone who was OK with fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've tried a lot of different moisturizers, and many are affective at hydrating your skin but not that often do they actually help with keeping your skin clear. This does! The only thing I wasn't in love with was the way it feels on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this moisturizer! I can see a difference in my skin tone and love that it has spf in it for when I'm in the sun. It doesn't burn on my dry skin like some other moisturizers do. It's also not oily at all. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the scent of the product and how smooth it went on my skin. It absorbed well. Great that it has SPF.
Not sure if it makes my skin a little more greasy during the day but Ill be testing further. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product smells nice, goes on easy but I thought it was a little runny. After 2 applications, I had a couple of pimples pop out. I do like that it has SPF 15 in it but I probably won't be purchasing this moisturizer. Maybe good for another skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"CLEARLY BRIGHTER BRIGHTENING & SMOOTHING DAILY MOISTURIZER SPF 15 WORKS WONDERFULLY TO HYDRATE & SOFTEN, AS WELL AS BRIGHTENING MY DRY DULL SKIN ON MY FACE. I LOVE THAT IT IS LIGHT-WEIGHT & IT CONTAINS SPF SO I CAN SATISFY ALL MY FACIAL NEEDS IN ONE STEP! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have super sensitive skin I break out so easy I was scared to try the lotion but a have read other reviews and I give it a shot! So here I'm trying and wow!!! Super good experience did break out at all my skin feels super smooth!! Well I'm gonna buy it now and keep using it!!! Thank for the sample !!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Perfect for sensitive skin! I love the fact it helps protect your skin from sun damage and I can use it on my sensitive skin! There was a great amount of the sample for me to use it for 2 weeks straight and my face looks a lot clearer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"THE SPF works great, I wore it every day for weeks and have experienced no sunburns. I also have been loving the moisture, it keeps my skin from getting dry and flakey. I'm not sure if I have noticed my skin being brighter but it does seem to be evening my complexion somewhat. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is light, it doesn't feel like it's clogging my pores. Some moisturizers make my face sweat immediately after applying but not this one. It leaves my face soft and it looks clearly brighter. It smells good and it has spf 15 which is good. It has antioxidant complex Vitamin C + LHA & is oil-free! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed this brightening and smoothing moisturizer. However, I felt like I needed to re-apply due to the low SPF (which may certainly appeal to many people). This is why I would recommend the product to many of my friends. It is just not strong enough for me to use every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Clearly Brighter is a nice light weight easy to apply moisturizer that is easy to apply and melts into the skin with no greasy feel. It has a scent that is pleasant and not overpowering. Skin does seem brighter where it is applied. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not sure if I noticed my skin any brighter or smoother after using the moisturizer, but it definitely left it moisturized and I love that it had spf 15 for those times I get sunscreen on the kids but forget to do my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"As a mom of 2, my skin has suffered from lack of sleep and stress! This product brightened up my skin overnight and helped me to look like I had much more sleep than I actually did. I love the smell and feel of it, and it is lightweight enough to work its magic without feeling greasy or thick. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this moisturizer! I have been looking for one that improves skin tone since I got some spots after my children were born. I love the way this goes on and I think it's already began to fade my biggest age spot! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have sensitive and combination skin that can be really dry in areas and somewhat oily in others. This moisturizer is wonderful. It goes on really well and a little goes a long way. I really like that it contains an spf too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was surprised there was no scent when i smelled it right on the bottle,but after applying it had a light lovely scent, not too over powering as it would clash with perfume i would wear. I found it to be creamy and absorbs quickly. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Thank you so very much for sending a sample of the brightening skin moisturizer with spf. I live in New Mexico where it is extremely dry so my skin is always dry. I applied this product in the morning before heading out for the day and it kept my face moisturizerized all day long!
Thank you so much! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's hard to find a lotion or sunscreen that doesn't result in a breakout. This just didn't work for me. I'll finish out the sample to see if it just takes some getting used to, but so far -- not a winner for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very sensitive skin (rosacea), so I always look for deep moisturizing products that don't irritate my skin. Unfortunately this moisturizer really irritated my skin. After 15 minutes, my skin was itchy and red. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been hoping for a Garnier SPF moisturizer that doesn't leave a pasty film like my previous one, and this one is great. It moisturizes and protects my face from the sun, but it does not rub off into these pasty, white flakes like my previous one. It also does not leave a greasy feeling and does not have a bothersome scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how smooth it makes my skin feel while giving me protection from the sun. I use it under make up (foundation) so I don't usually reapply like I should but I generally keep my face out of the sun. I'd love it if they marketed this with tint but for now it's working for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this product. It did what it said it would. Unfortunately. Olays new regenerist tone correcting lotion changed my preference. This product is absolutely wonderful. I am addicted to the product and smell. If i would have never tried this, i probably would have switched to this brand. I would highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this on my face when I wanted to go with very little make up. It make my skin look so bright! And it went on smooth and it was not greasy at all. This is perfect for a day out in the summer. Sun protection is a major plus also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved this product because it made my skin feel silky smooth without being greasy or oily. I already have very oily skin so I am cautious with the moisturizers I choose. It also smelled great and was lightweight. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I thought this product was decent but I have already found a skincare routine that works well for me so that's what I'll stick with. The product wasn't bad I just have something else that works the best for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After trying this product for a week I did notice some slight improvements with my skin tone being more even which I was hoping for. I work out in the sun so a little help is good for me. I also thought it helped the texture of my skin to look healthier after using it for the week. Another added bonus to using this moisturizer is that it contains SPF 15 protection while using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love how it feels on my skin and the fact that it has SPF in it seals the deal for me. My skin looks wonderful when I use it after getting out of the shower and I like putting it on my knuckles, elbows, and knees to keep them from getting dark in the sun. Lovely product!

"I have pretty sensitive skin and I had a mild reaction to this product feeling a little tingly on my skin, after a few minutes that sensation went away so there could have been other factors but I did not give it a second chance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tend to really like Garnier products. I love the smell of their moisturizer. I know that's not a great reason to buy one, but all other things equal, I'd like to put something on my face in the morning that smells fresh and nice. I honestly don't know if my face looks brighter, or smoother, but it hasn't broken out and I tend to be sensitive to that. Also, the sunscreen part is great. I recommend this and plan to buy it soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I should start by saying that I use a tinted moisturizer usually, so that is the primary reason that this didn't work as well for me. However, I felt that this was a very basic moisturizer. The formula was a little too 'thin' for my preference, and I really didn't see any noticeable brightening of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It is a moisterizer and had spf 15. The only thing i would change is the amount of spf delivered. The ozone layer is getting thinner therefore we need more protection than before and 15 is a joke in todays world. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I did not particularly care for this product. Maybe that is because I already have a really good face moisturizer. However the product felt a bit greasy and too soft, runny. Also smelled like suntan lotion which I do not care for on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was AMAZED at how well Garnier's new Clearly Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer worked! It looked like I got 10 hours of sleep, even though I had barely slept at all. I could literally watch the bags under my eyes disappear! It went on smoothly, and stayed on all day. It smelled great, too! I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a very light product that protects your skin while allowing it to breathe. I did not feel like my pores were clogged at all by this product and most importantly, it did not cause my face to sweat like many other products in this category.

This brightening moisturizer has not caused any issues with my sensitive skin and the SPF 15 is a bonus for daily protection. I received a sample to try and will now be purchasing this product and I also want to try a similar Garnier brightener anti-sun damage product with SPF 30.

"This moisturizer was good, I just don't need a brightening moisturizer. If you need one that helps brighten your skin I'm sure this one would be a good choice. It's just not something I need at this time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love the Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer!! My makes my skin feel so soft, smooth, and hydrated! It doesn't leave it sticky feeling on my skin, it absorbs into my skin very nicely. It makes my skin look healthier & softer, by far the best daily moisturizer I have ever used. And you can see improvements in your skin very quickly, very impressive! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am loving this new moisturizer. It is creamy but doesnt cause me to break out. It has a light and refreshing citrus scent which I am loving. I would say this is better than neutrogena oil free moisturizers. It certainly helped brighten up my skin within a few days [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is light and airy compared to other facial moisturizers that contain SPF. This blended in fast and I did notice that my face appeared a bit brighter. This didn't seem to make my face greasy either, which is a plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I always love Garnier products scent. It's so fresh and unique. The product it self feels good and sinks in immediately BUT I wish it wasn't just SPF 15. If it came in a 30 or higher I would certainly purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is not a bad sunscreen, but not my favorite. It comes out of the tube thick so that you get good coverage when applying to the face. The fragrance is citrus fresh which is a little much for me. It doesn't wear well under my makeup - after about an hour my face looks very shiny. This product is worked best for me when worn alone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I decided to give this a try when we went to an amusement park this weekend. It never made my face feel oily at all even through the blasting sun and heat. The SPF was enough that my face did not get burnt from all day wear. I only felt that I need to apply it again toward the end of the night. My face was smooth all day and didn't feel like it dried out at any point. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I thought this product would be great as I work in vehicles and outdoors quite a bit and this would be a simple one step instead of just the regular moisturizer I use. Unfortunately this product within a day of using it made my face break out so bad. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This went on smoothly and did not feel greasy. It has a nice scent as well. It was nice to try. I am just satisfied with my current skin care line, and moisturizer that has an SPF 15, so I am not ready to change to an entirely new skin care line to use this particular moisturizer with sun screen.

"This product works great as a moisturizer and I would definitely recommend it for that. It is also probably fine for general daily sunscreen protection.

i have senstive skin so i tested it on the back of my hand it went on easy my skin instantly was smooth and soft and it smells great it wasnt greasy and dried rather quick left no residue behind . very nice product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like that it is not oily and that you can put under makeup but it is not a good sunscreen for daily use if you are going to be out in the sun more than 15 minutes. We went to the flea market and my face was red my the time I got home [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like an inexpensive moisturizer that has a sunscreen in it so that I do not have to apply both! I get ready in a hurry in the morning and it makes it so much easier! It makes my makeup go on smooth even though I have patchy areas of dry skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I loved how this lotion took care of my patchy, dry, flaky skin. I get small patches of dry skin all over my face and even though I use a nightly moisturizer, by morning, there are little dry patches all over. I used this on a weekend that I knew I would be spending time outdoors. It not only absorbed well, the dry patches remained gone thru the entire day and the SPF 15 protected my fair skin from the sun while I was outside.

"I have mixed feelings towards this spf. I like that it's lightweight and makes my skin smooth. Most moisturizers with spf are sticky or leave white streaks on my face , this didn't . the bottle says its ""brighting "" But my face didn't feel brighter . I saw no difference . I had to reduce my review to three stars because it doesn't brighten as the product claims [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It was great! It rubbed in quickly, didn't leave my skin feeling oily, protected me in full sun for 8+ hours (though I don't burn to easily) and wasn't over ""smelly"" so even my husband used it! My fare-skinned friend used it and said it worked quite well! The price point is decent as well although I would Ike to it as a regular sunscreen product!

This smell was dreadful. Made me gag. It was watery. Didnt moisturize much and it kind of made my skin feel even more dry (I have combo skin). This product felt cheap. Id never compare it to high end moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I really liked how easy it was to apply this Garnier Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer. What I didn't like is that shortly after application, my face felt really oily and looked greasy. Sinc I don't have combination skin,Mathis concerned me. I would like to finish using this product to see if this improves. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this product was pretty nice. it smelled great, and worked okay, from what i can tell. the only problem is that it irritated the skin around my eyes! no problems with the rest of my face or neck. it moisturized really well. again, didn't use the product long enough to tell if it offered any clearness or brightness long term. it was an okay product, i like it, other than the eye irritation. so, basically, don't be like me... avoid your eye area!

"Many moisturizers are irritating to my skin and cause breakouts, so I was happy to try a sample of this product before buying a full sized product. My skin felt supple and smooth after using this and my makeup applied easily over the top. This seems to be an excellent product that was gentle on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product didn't work out for me, but that's because I have sensitive skin that sometimes doesn't react well to various products. This made me break out more, which is not ideal. However, I liked the feel of the moisturizer, and it did make my skin feel hydrated. I just can't use it long term personally. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It was nice and smooth and definitely worked as a sunblock, but on the third day, I started having redness - I think the either the sunscreen or the brighteners were too much for my ultra-sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a very nice feeling product. It has a soft pleasant fragrance and a little goes a long way. I haven't been able to use it for a long period of time, so I'm not sure how much it brightens your complexion.

"I liked this product okay. I like that it had sunscreen in it to protect my face without having to apply another product, but I didn't like that it leaves behind the sunscreen smell. I can smell what goes on my face all day long and I don't particularly care for a strong smell of sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed sampling the CLEARLY BRIGHTER BRIGHTENING & SMOOTHING DAILY MOISTURIZER SPF 15 . I liked how it felt on my skin and I enjoed how it left my skin feeling. I also liked the fact that it had spf in it. I wish the spf was a little bit higher but I still enjoyed this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Skin Active is a better moisturizer then a sunscreen. Not enough safety protection only SPF 15 as my fair skin likes and too many chemicals for my environmental leanings. After a few uses I could not see a brightening or smoothing effect but will keep using it as it might take time to prove that benefit. I like the Vitamin C [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product felt good when I first put it on. However, it ended up leaving me with a really greasy oily feeling. My face was shiny and I ended up even breaking out after a couple of uses. My other issue with this product is that after putting it on I went outdoors for a short amount of time and I still ended up with a bit of a sunburn. I will say though,to be fair, I do have light skin and burn easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't think it's a bad product, it's just not for me. There's a light citrus scent which isn't overwhelming, but I prefer not to use scented products on my face. The sunscreen is fine and the texture of the cream is thick which didn't bother. However, it's supposed to be brightening and smoothing, but I didn't see that from my usage. I think it's an okay moisturizing, but it doesn't do everything that it claims to do on the label. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have never tried Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer with a spf 15 before until I got a free sample from pinchme.com. I'm very impressed with how well it made my face feel. Will be looking more into this and purchasing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I Love the Garnier Brand. I liked the fact that this lotion didn't leave my skin all greasy and oily. It did make me break out though so that is not a good thing in my book. It also felt a little heavy on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been enjoying this moisturizer on days I don't get a ton of sun exposure. I appreciate the spf and the fact that the moisturizer is not too think and goes on well under my makeup. For days I know I will be in the sun I prefer more spf, but for daily use this is great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the smell and how light it is so doesn't feel like your wearing it. I liked how it didn't leave my face feeling super greasy like another sunscreens. I put it on before I went running and it didn't run down my face hurting my eyes like some other sunscreens. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried it for two days and got an allergic reaction. But I did give the remaining sample to my sister who it worked great on. She liked the sun protection it provides and that it was light feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The scent is a little much, but it's pleasant - it may be because I always have used unscented moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and really like this moisturizer. My current one I was using was leaving my face greasy throughout the day - but since I switched to this I've been a happy camper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very pale, very sensitive skin that burns almost as soon as I go outside. This product was very nice. It didn't feel like sunscreen. It felt like a beauty product, and I didn't burn! That's a win win in my book! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this twice while cutting grass for over an hour each time. I never use a sunscreen but I do feel good using this sample. It absorbs well into the skin. The scent is pleasant and not strong. Reminds me of suntan lotion. It left no greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The lotion is nice but spf 15 doesnt do anything for you. It's not enough. So it's a waste to even put in there. It won't help you against the sun and it gives people the false impression that it will. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this moisturizer for a few days now and I really am seeing a difference in my skin tone. I feel like it's brighter and firmer. I love the fact that there's sunscreen already in the moisturizer so I don't need a separate product to prevent further damage. I really love Garnier products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
love this stuff. it goes on silky smooth and is great because it has an spf in it. I would probably prefer that they used a 30 spf since that is the highest recommended spf to use. but all in all its a pretty good product. may purchase it in the future. but I am still using another brand that is pretty comparable to this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I will never understand why companies insist on adding fragrance to their products because it doesn't allow those of us with sensitive skin to use them. I would not recommend using this on your face if you're sensitive or have allergic reactions to fragrance in products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Now that summer is fast approaching and I'm outside more, I always make sure to use a moisturizer with SPF! It's so important to take care of my skin and love that I can now do it with a product that absorbs quickly with no greasy feeling and an SPF!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't always have great luck with moisturizers that have SPF in them, but this one protected my skin from the sun. I am fair skinned and that is a tough feat, but this actually worked and moisturized. It left my skin a little greasy, but it didn't feel like that for long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wow, this product just glides right onto your skin leaving it well moisturized without that greasy feeling that you typically get when using lotion. I LOVE that it already has SPF in it. I can just use this as my facial moisturizer when heading to the beach. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked this product just for the texture alone - it was not what I would consider a heavy moisturizer. It moisturized without feeling weighty on my face. The SPF 15 and the pleasant scent were really just a bonus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer felt great going on and left my skin feeling very soft and not greasy. I felt like the SPF helped as I did not burn after going outside to do gardening without applying a separate SPF product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I stick to fragrance free skin care product due to sensitive skin, however after smelling the product and finding it to only be lightly scented i gave it a try. It was smooth and lightweight and hydrated my skin quite well. The scent is fresh, sweet and light. I am still using the sample and have had no negative reactions, but i am using it sparingly so as not to irritate my skin. I was happily surprised by this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was an ok product. I didn't understand whether it was supposed to be for body or face, but I ended up using it on my face. The scent was a little overwhelming and I did not feel that it was terribly moisturizing. In fact, I ended up adding a little bit of my regular moisturizer to my face. I do like that it has sunscreen in the lotion, but since I use makeup products that have spf as well, I just really don't have a need for the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturizer. I have been a Clinique user for over 10 years, but I will be switching to this moisturizer. It has a light, fresh scent... Not like a lot of others that contain SPF, and gives my skin a beautiful glow and incredibly soft feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Bright and healthy skin is made easy with Garnier's new moisturizer. Like most women, my skin gets dull because of tiredness, environment and stress. It is really great to find a moisturizer that will help combat all these and more."
"The scent is not offensive, it goes on clear and it makes my skin look and feel great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I been using this daily and I have so much positive things to say about this. I love how fast this absorbs into my skin. I also love this because it does not break out my skin. This is also non greasy and does not leave a white cast on my skin which a lot of sunscreen tend to do. The only con I can say is that I wish the SPF was highly. I think SPF30 will be sufficient for the summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like that the moisturizer claims to brighten and smooth skin which I really need. I was given a pretty decent sized sample but the sample wasn't enough to show much of a difference in my skin tone. I didn't see much brightening in my skin. The moisturizer was pretty nice. It wasn't too greasy or too drying but slightly more on the greasy side. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My overall experience with this product was good but nothing made it stand out compared to other moisturizers. I liked the smell of the product. The consistency was a little thin compared to what I like. I liked how it was absorbed into the skin quickly. My skin felt refreshed after applying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So, I use Cetaphil for oily skin moisturizer on a daily basis and that one seems to have a bit more what I am looking for in a moisturizer than this one however, I could see myself buying this in the future in winter seeing as it did provide great hydration and my skin did seem smoother (neither of these are big issues in summer) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Sadly, this product broke my face out. I really need a moisturizer, but unfortunately this isn't for me.. I had high hopes as I use the micellar water from this brand with no problem.. It did feel good on my skin, did not feel greasy & seemed to absorb well. Unfortunately, I had to give one star due to the break outs it caused... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the fact that it moisturized my skin but also add the protection of a SPF since I'm out in the sun a lot it didn't interfere with my make up and gave me extra skin protection in one product instead of having to use 2-3 different products .I will purchase . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the clearly brighter moisturizer and found it to be very creamy and when applying a little goes a long way. I found that my face experiened acne breakouts so I stopped using it must be to oily for my sensitive skin. If I had not had that experience I more than likely would have continued using the lotion as I loved the fact that it was also contained a sunscreen component. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked this moisturizer. It's great for everyday; lightweight, spf, and it brightened my dull complexion. Also this was a very generous sample size, so I got to see full benefits from this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Though the idea of this product is great, I believe there is room for improvement. The brightening is nothing more than exfoliating causing your skin to peel layers. The moisture is good but it doesn't stay like other products do [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the garnier clearly brighter daily moisturizer for free. I really like the smell. It was not sticky when I put it on or even afterwards which I also like. The only problem that I had was I accidently rubbed it on a sore that I had and it burned. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is oe of my favorites, it not only makes my skin look and feel great, but the smell is so amazing!!!! I would recommend this product to every one. I Love that its a moisturizer, brightener, and sunscreen all in one. My new ""before going out"" remedy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily moisturizer with SPF15 smells great and keeps my skin smooth. An SPF of 15 is an important feature and I don't like to wear daytime moisturizer with out the sunscreen protection. The light weight formula soaked into my skin and didn't feel greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product had a nice scent and didn't feel heavy on my skin. After being out in the sun a few hours, I was not burnt, so it seems to do it's job. I didn't care for the lingering scent, even though it smelled good. I prefer fragrance free products, but am not against using this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was really excited to try this moisturizer! It's at a way better price point than the brightening moisturizer I currently use. This moisturizer absorbs well and I loved that it has an SPF. Some of the things I didn't like were that I didn't really see my skin ""brighten"" like I do with the moisturizer I currently use and the texture could be better if the moisturizer wasn't so thin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great daily moisturizer with the added benefit of SPF! It lays wonderfully under both serum and power foundation. As a fair skinned red head living in Florida, I do wish this came in a higher SPF than 15 so I could use it not only on regular days, but days at the beach and in the sun for many hours. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
SPF protection is kinda low for this product unless it's only intended to be for the face. Not indicated on bottle so I only used on arms and legs. I applied on a few sunny days and don't appear to be worse for though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I generally use another product, but my face always felt greasy. This blends into my skin and I can't tell I even put it on. I also had trouble when I sweated that the other brand would ""wash off"" into my eyes. I don't have that problem now [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only used this twice to get a feel for it, and it works pretty well! I have very dry skin and it helped with that while not feeling sticky or messy afterwards. I'm saving the rest to use for travel since it's the perfect size! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how this product is non-greasy and when you put it on it's so lightweight and I smells really good. I have notice that my face feels so soft & it looks brighter. I would so keep using this for a good time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I never expect new skin care products to live up to their claims but I was pleasantly surprised with the Garner Clearly Brighter. It really made my skin look brighter and younger. It also has a nice scent, is not oily, and did not irritate my skin. This one is my new best friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I thought that this product was OK. It really didn't do much of anything to my skin as far as brightening or smoothing that I could tell. Maybe with continued use it might but I don't use products that contain SPF because of the smell [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved the product it smells wonderful and is very silky on skin my only complaint about it is that, after it is rubbed in skin it leaves a sticky like light film on you but otherwise great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This moisturizer makes my skin feel soft and I love that it is spf 15 so I don't have to put sunscreen on too. It smells great and doesn't leave a greasy film like other moisturizers with sunscreen do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very pleased with how this didn't make my face feel greasy after application as some moisturizers can. Where I live, summer seems to come early and it's nice to have a product that works when you've subjected yourself to endless hours in the sun and your skin is aching for hydration.

This is my first time trying out Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15. I liked the fact that this moisturizer was creamy and went on smooth and that it protected my skin from the sun.

I will continue to use Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer for my skin needs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this in a 1 fl oz sample size which is awesome! I've used it several times on my crazy sensitive skin and have had not problems. Would have given it 4.5 stars because the scent is a bit stronger than I would like, but couldn't get the adjustments right on the rating system. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Instantly fell in love with this product. It smells AMAZING and it really does the job it claims. I notice instantly a brighter tone In my skin when I put it on and it has worked well with my skin not causing any breakouts [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The clearly brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisterizer with spf made my skin feel nice. I like that it didn't make me feel greasy. It was a light texture with a very minimal odor. The SPF makes me feel better about sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the fact that this moisturizer has spf 15 sunscreen in it. That seemed to work well. I was outside several days while using the product and didn't get sunburned. The moisturizer made my face feel soft and smooth, not sure about the 'brightening"" though. What I didn't like about this product was that it felt thicker than my regular moisturizer on my face after applying, I could still feel it long after I put it on. I also broke out a little while using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It has a nice scent to it. I like that it is a daily moisturizer with sunscreen in it. Most people don't think about putting sunscreen on with this it's a no brainer since you'll be using it daily. It also decreases the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging, that is a plus too. This is a very good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What I really like about this moisturizer is that is light, and non greasy, won't cause me any skin reactions, allergies, or acne, still too early to see about the brightening properties, but I am beginning to see some improvement, so I will be purchasing this since it sees to work for my skin type!

This moisturizer seems nice. Doesn't seem greasy or make my skin oily. I get red hives from most moisturizers but didn't with this one. Sample was too small to wear for 2 weeks to see how my face felt. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great moisturizer and sunscreen! My face feels so soft and definitely brightens the tone in your face. It absorbs quickly into the skin and keeps your face feeling hydrated all day. Smells great too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The scent of the lotion was so off putting that I almost forgot that it did moisturize my skin. Although it is oil free, it made my skin look shiny. I assume shiny skin is evidence of the brightening effect of the sunscreen. It didn't leave my skin feeling greasy and it did not take a lot of effort to get it to absorb into my skin. My only complaint is that it smells like grass. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really loved this product.. It is great that you can use it every morning under your makeup without feeling greasy. I like this product a lot for my daily sunscreen protection. It is hard to find a good sunscreen product without the smell and feel of many of the sunscreen products out there. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It went on very smooth and has a great scent. I love Ganger I use a ton of their products and they haven't gone wrong for me yet. I love their scents of their products.

"I'm not a big user of moisturizers or sunscreens, but my wife is, as she is very fair-skinned. That being said, she really liked how the product worked, but she (and I) weren't fans of the scent. Just too much going on, is the best way I can explain it. Less scent, or a different one, would be better in our opinions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use a moisturizer as part of my morning routine. I put aside my other moisturizers and used the Garnier for a week. I liked the way it made my skin feel. No greasiness. I also liked the sunscreen aspect for protection along with moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I'm a one product kind of person, and if I am going to apply a moisturizer with sunscreen, I'd rather it be a BB cream or something with coverage. I have Garnier BB cream and love all Garnier products!!!!!!! Love love love! I'm just too simplistic to need a moisturizer and sunscreen in one. I need makeup on haahha [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"this moisturizer felt heavy. it left my skin with a ""burning"" sensation. I wouldn't recommend this to family or friends. the fragrance wasn't too awful powering, that's about all the positivity that I can say about this product. well, it maybe okay as far as a sunscreen goes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was surprised that I really liked this product. The smell was perfume-like but in no way was it too strong. I thought it was just enough of a scent to enjoy. The moisturizer spread well and covered enough area with just a small amount. And I loved using it before putting on foundation because it helped my makeup glide better. Definitely made my face feel moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Liked the feel of how smoothly it went on and really did make my skin feel good. But I have oily skin and some somehow creeped up to my eyes (no I did not put it on my eye) and once it got in them I had to wash all my makeup off and douse my eyes with tear type eye drops to flush them. Oh the burn! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This concoction did not agree with my skin type (or whatever?) and I do not have sensitive skin. It really wouldn't be fair to give it a low rating - the texture was nice enough. I did have to wash it off almost immediately tho. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've tried a bajillion different types of moisturizers over the years and tend to stick to mild moisturizers with SPF like Clinique or Neutrogena. This moisturizer is great - it goes on and absorbs quickly - doesn't leave a layer of product waiting to melt into the skin. I felt like it really did brighten my skin and give it a bit of a glow even under my foundation. I'm loving the smell as well even if others may think it's a bit chemically. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the fact that it isn't full of perfume and makes me smell funny. It doesn't cover my face in grease either, so that's nice. I'm not sure how well it brightens up my dark spots/areas since I haven't really noticed any changes yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the first time I have used any facial moisture so this was a first. After I washed my face with hot water and when I apply the moisture my skin feel cool and smooth and also super soft!

"Although I haven't really noticed any kind of ""brightening"" effect from this product, I do like that it is a moisturizer with SPF which is very important to me.

This was a great sample size with a good amount of product. I have very dry and sensitive skin so it is hard to find a facial moisturizer that suits my skin type.

I tried this product for 1 week and I didn't like it. It left my skin very oily and it felt heavy. I didn't like the way my foundation/make-up felt or looked on top of this product.

It was amazing the way it soaked into my skin very quickly and it felt wonderful.i told my daughter about it and she tried it also. Since then we both have bought some. Thanks a lot for the sample.

"because of the fragrance of this product, while pleasing to some, is not something i want to keep using because i'm prone to migraines."
this product absorbs pretty quickly and makes the skin soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First I would like to say how I have tried several different brands of sunscreen & not one of them I have liked so much compared to this one. Finally one that leaves no grease shiny looking skin. I tried it out on a day I went to the zoo. It was about 86℉ that day & it was a life saver. Honestly forgot I even had it on.Great product will be purchasing.

"I really like the way it glides onto skin. It is absorbed in quickly and completely without being tacky or sticky. My skin is cleaner and clearer, but it will take a few more tries to see the full effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked using this product, it absorbed easily and I like that it has a SPF 15. Unfortunately, for my aging skin, I felt I needed something a bit richer but for younger skin or perhaps oilier skin, this is a nice product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product and it goes on with no greasy feeling and leaves you skin feeling soft and smooth. I'm sure with extended use this moisturizer will help with the fine lines and the smoothness of your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the product, for me the drawback is that it is a skin brightening moisturizer doesn't that mean it lightens your skin complexion when used. I don't want lighter skin just to moisturize my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The last time I used a moisturizer with SPF in it, I had to return it because it kept making me break out. For that reason, I was nervous to try this but was pleasantly surprised that it didn't make my skin greasy or break out. It also doesn't have an overpowering sunscreen smell, in fact it smells quite nice and light. I'm excited to continue using it and see the longer term results of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It left my skin with a nice texture and didn't smell bad. I'm sensitive to sunscreens and this one didn't bother me so that was great! I just didn't notice the smoothing or brightening effects. That may be due to the short time period but who knows. Nice just basic moisturizer though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't really like using SPF on my face, although it has its advantages I really prefer not to in the summer months because my tan is usually uneven. However for the product as a moisturizer it does the job. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First off I love Garnier products! They have come out with amazing products from hair to face. And this ( CLEARLY BRIGHTER BRIGHTENING & SMOOTHING DAILY MOISTURIZER SPF 15) is just as good as all their products. This left my face Visibly brighter, more radiant and more even skin tone. I really like this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A gentle morning moisturizer for the summer days where you need that extra little bit of protection. Keeps the skin hydrated and clean while blocking out some of those harmful rays. Absolutely loved this product and, when my sample runs out, I'm definitely going to be buying more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I prefer sunscreen that is very smooth. Product is ok but not for me.
(I'm currently using Nivea water gel sunscreen.) If a friend or family asks I'd recommend it or share what's left of the sample.
So far I haven't seen this product in a store I looked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is truly amazing! Within one week my face felt so soft and was definitely brighter. Clearly Brighter smells great and the fact it has sunscreen combined in it is a major plus. I had to go purchase more after I tried the sample product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the way this product feels on my skin. For summer it is lightweight and non greasy (not always true of moisturizers with sunscreen in them). However, it is so heavily fragranced/perfumed that I can't handle using it. I hoped the smell would dissipate soon after use but it doesn't. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am not a big skin person. After using this for a few weeks after getting this, I noticed an improvement in my skin. It was like a glow that just was amazing! I have to say that I am loving the skin protection as well because I do worry about sun damage now that I am close to 30. While using this I know that my skin is safe and which I am in love with!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this on my face, I don't use a daily moisturizer, however I don't go out into the sun much either. I thought it worked well as a quick moisturizer with a low SPF to throw in your bag if you need a quick moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really loved using this moisterizer. It felt very light on the skin, non greasy, and super smoothing. I also liked that it absorbed rather quickly into my skin. It left my face feeling super smooth for hours afterward. I was so shocked at how smooth my skin felt, I was going around forcing my family to feel my face lol. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin felt great after putting this on my face. It made me feel like my skin was luminous, and it also protects against the sun, which is great. I went to the zoo after putting it on and was outside all day without reapplying and did not get burnt. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love that this moisturizer does not make your eyes burn if you sweat and it creeps into the eyes. Most sunscreens will do that. Pleasantly surprised! It feel lovely not greasy and very easy to work into the skin. It's effortless! Smell is nice and I will definitely purchase once I'm out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have very sensitive skin and can only use particular products. If I stray away from acne control products, I tend to break out if I use them more than one day at a time. I like that this is a lightweight SPF, but I would not use two consecutive days as I did notice a difference in the texture of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i loved how this made my face tingle and feel so clean after i used it. i enjoyed using it alone and with my clirasonic. this was great for vacation too and my face felt really dirty from traveling and being outside in the sun all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It protects my skin against sun and moisturizes my face well. I wear makeup as foundation on it and it works very well together . I like that moisturizer and I just bought the other in the same collection with SPF 30. I love it too. This is my new daytime cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am happy that I did try the sample. I liked the fact that this product has sunscreen in it and helps my skin become an even tone. Which I need as I am getting older. Can't wait to see the improvement in a week. Thanks for the all in one. It isn't greasy or anything. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Its not the best thats for sure and I didn't notice if my face was brighter and it wasn't the best moisturizing my face was soft and moisturized for a second then it wasn't. It is nice to use before applying makeup because it helps the foundation blend n my skin so I did like using it for that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Generally I have a very hard time using different products on my face so I was hesitant to try this, but I love it. It did not break out my skin, it did not make it oily, and the scent is not over powering. I will be purchasing it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this moisturizer! I used this everyday I was on vacation in Florida. The SPF was enough to keep any burn at bay and kept my skin feeling healthy and looking smooth. This lotion smelled great as well. Will be buying in the future. Thank you PINCHME! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have very super sensitive skin and I was glad that this product didn't cause irritation. It doesn't smell bad and is very light weight but does moisturize very well. Plan on buying when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The sample size was sufficient to use enough times to know that I was going to like it over the long-term. you know how sometimes you use something once and you're like, well maybe so maybe no, but this one was just right. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used other sunscreen moisturizers that claimed to be oil freed but still appeared to cause break-outs. This truly protected me from the sun and did not cause me to look oily or shiny while being out in the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 is a great product to use for your skin. I used it on a day I was going to be outdoors all day and my skin was not at all irritated by the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product was a wonderful sample. Garnier tends to give a generous amount for samples instead of a small dab good for one use. I actually got to use this for a whole week! Although i mostly use it on my arms and neck, I find that it absorbs quickly and the scent is subtle and not very overwhelming. The best part is after it dries, it doesn't leave a stick residue like some of the other stuff. I only wish it had more of an SPF protection, like a 30 or 40. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I live in an area where we get a lot of sun.

"I thought this was a nice moisturizer for wearing alone or under makeup during the day. It was non-greasy, but I'm not sure whether it had a brightening effect or not. I think I might use this if I were younger and didn't need moisturizers that have anti-aging/firming components to them. Also, I rarely spend a lot of time outside, so the SPF aspect is kind of wasted on me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product does exactly what it says it will do. My skin is brighter! It all but eliminated the dullness. It is a little greasy at furst, but it does absorb well. Overall it's a good product that I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I usually don't like moisturizers with spf in them because they smell like sunscreen. This one does but just a little bit and it doesn't last. Now that it's summer I need SPF like no one believes! I have yet to get a sun burn on my face once I started using this product! YEAH! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a nice moisturizer with just a bit of sun protection. I personally would like a little more spf but layered with other products it should be sufficient. This left my skin well hydrated and soft . I am not sure I saw ""brightening"" but maybe that comes with more use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love Garnier products therefore I was excited about trying this product. I thought this was a great sample. I have combination to oily skin so I used it under my makeup as a primer and my makeup stayed matte throughout my entire work day. I did notice that my skin actually looked brighter and more awake and alive. I liked this product and intend on purchasing it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This face lotion went on easily and and helped keep my skin looking great all day. It did sting for the first minute or so, but then my skin calmed down. The only drawback for me is that this product only contained SPF 15, not SPF 30. I would recommend this ti my friends, but it just wasn't for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This spa 15 moisturizer is great. I've been using it everyday. I use lot of serums, oils, lotions, and other products, including make-up, everyday on my face. Some sunscreen moisturizers can be thick and pasty, especially on top of all my other products but this one is not thick, goes on smoothly, and absorbs quickly. Love it ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love that this product is not only a moisturizer but has an SPF of 15! Which is great because I don't have to debate whether I should wear moisturizer or sunscreen for the day but now there's a product out there that has both in one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I could see the product working well as a sunscreen however for me personally, it didn't work too well in combination with my oily prone skin. Scent was not bad but smelled more like sunscreen than anything else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Clearly Brighter seemed to work well. I used it on my face and it did not interfere with my makeup. It has a pleasant scent but it is not to over powering. It dries silky and not sticky. The only thing that would be nice to have is a bit more sun screen. It is only a SPF 15 . For my day time moisturizers I like a bit more than that but it could work for night time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this moisturizer! Since using it, my skin is smoother and feels more refreshed and healthy. The scent is light and not overpowering, which is important to me. It goes on smooth and doesn't have a sticky feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the Clearly Brighter Moisturizer. It was great that it had sun protection in a moisturizer that I could use daily. I loved the way it could be smoothly applied and that way it left my skin feeling smooth. The sun tends to dry my skin so I need a good moisturizer to fight that aspect of my skin.

I enjoyed using this product. It kept my skin nice and I also like how it's a lotion and sunblock. It did not leave any stickiness or oily feeling . It was easy to apply it was smooth and had a nice scent to it. I also used it on my son and it helped him from getting sunburn. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The claims on the packaging say it goes on smooth without leaving an oily residue and they were truthful! Just moments after massaging the moisturizer into the skin on my face, it was as if I hadn't applied anything at all. I love it when products do what they say they're going to. I just don't use a daily moisturizer like this currently, but if I did, I would consider buying Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf 15! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the light texture and subtle fragrance of this moisturizer. It also absorbed quickly and made my skin feel great. I personally did not notice any brightening of my skin, although i am very pale. The sunscreen is a great bonus. I will recommend this product to younger friends, but I need something a bit more ""heavy duty"" for my fine lines and wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for a week now, with more product to go. My family doctor asked me what I was doing since I was glowing!

This is a fantastic combination of features for a product. I love that it has a mild sunscreen and it really does moisturize my skin! I use it daily. And it never leaves my hands or face feeling slimy or sticky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the problem I had with this product was the fact that there was not enough product to make a decent review. I like what I saw but hard to give a great review because their is not enough in the sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was extremely pleased with the sample of the Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. I find that most moisturizers with SPF go on very thick. This one distributed nicely on my face, and felt very smooth. I also liked that it had a nice, subtle scent. For the price point, this is really a great find!

"I really like the idea of moisturizer that is beneficial to skins appearance in multiple ways. This repairs brightens & smooths skin & prevents sun damage. It absorbs quickly, with no heavy or sticky feeling [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this product. I use it every day on my face. It has helped me in a lot of different ways. I love the smell of it. It has a slightly citrus smell to me. I would recommend for this product to be used every day to prevent sun damage. I'll be purchasing this product soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love that this has an SPF in it, but I wish it were a little higher. If also feels ok going on, but it made my skin very oily by the end of the day. I don't think this product was suited for my skin type - combination. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
While I did not dislike this product-the smell and texture was fine and I did not have any negative reactions- I spend a lot of time in the sun and prefer a screen that is 30-40 proof. I would recommend this product to others who do not spend much time in the sun and would like to get some color. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the way my skin feels after applying this. It feels and smells great. Not sure if it lightened dark spots, should've taken before and after pictures. It seemed like there was some improvement. I have used it alone and under make-up. It didn't cause any breakouts. Wearing it alone and doing yard work, I didn't burn or turn the slightest bit pink.

I used this mainly for the sun protection aspect of the cleanser. I thought it smelled great and clean. I felt like I was protected and it was a good product. I wouldn't use it as a primary moisturizer but would consider it if my usual wasn't available. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product was comparable to my other daytime moisturizer. I like that it does not feel greasy on the face and has SPF. It did however cause some clogged pores on my chin, so I am not sure if I would repurchase. I will continue using it and see if I like it enough to purchase.

"Garner Skin Active Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer is now my new summer lotion. It has a medium weight texture that spreads easily and absorbs into the skin quickly. It has a super lightweight feel on the skin which I appreciate even more so during the summer. I like that it has SPF 15 and worked well with my makeup. Because the complimentary sample was so effective, I will definitely purchase and repurchase this lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It probably helped a little with brightening of the skin, but it wasn't very obvious. I personally prefer a product that it more moisturizing. This seems to stay on your skin more than absorb into it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While not a bad sunscreen face lotion, this is not my favorite. The texture is nice, it's thick but doesn't pull on the skin when spreading. It's got a nice citrus scent, and does a nice job of making my skin feel moisturized, but after about an hour my skin looks shiny, it hasn't given my skin the promised boost of brightening.

I used the product every day until it ran out. My skin felt so soft and moisturized. My husband even commented that my face looked brighter and clearer. Very impressed with this product and do intend to purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like how this smells. It's a nice light citrus and floral scent but not overpowering. It goes on smooth and blends easily into the skin without leaving a white mask behind like other spf lotions. I am super oily so I don't expect it to control shine but it does not contribute to shine any more than usual like other lotions that may feel too greasy. I didn't notice a brightening effect but it may be because of the size of the sample and I might have to use it longer to see effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm a big fan of Garnier products, so I couldn't wait to try this. The texture is very creamy, so the sample goes a long way in trying it out. After using it twice (once in the morning and once at night) , my complexion did look bright and radiant. I'm loving the results and will continue to use the sample. Bonus: it smells awesome!

"My skin is in a terrible condition after more than a year fighting an illness and aging. After using this sample for just a few days my skin was clearly brighter, just like the name of the product. And the sample is large enough to determine if it will continue to be beneficial. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I love my moisturizer with sunscreen in it. I feel it's pointless to buy both moisturizer and sunscreen, so I try to combine the two. This moisturizer will be put in my rotation of moisturizers.

"This is great for people with oily skin! My skin is oily and i needed a moisturizer that didn't make my makeup slide off or add to the oil on my skin. It worked great! Plus, I love that there is spf. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product sample did moisturize my skin, and the added spf is a nice bonus, but the scent just wasn't for me. The consistency is very thin, so it's nice and light on the skin so that's a plus, too. I just wish I could have gotten over the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this product. It makes my skin feel soft and its light on my face. I like the spf especially because I'm in my upper 30s. It has a pleasant smell but I wish it wasn't so strong. Overall I think it's a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was very excited to try this sample!
I have been looking for a good moisturizer for the Texas heat and this one is perfect. Not too greasy and perfect amount of spf. I like to wear it underneath my makeup! Will be buying in the near future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I do not need to use face products like these just because it isn't part of my routine. however i did bring it with me on vacation and it came in handy. it is a good product. no irritation, and the spf kept me from burning as well as hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this moisturizer out for a whole now and I don't like it. The moisturizer really didn't do much for my skin. The moisturizer's consistency was not very thick. I didn't keep my face moisturized for any length of time. I did like the fragrance. I'm 45 and need a moisturizer more for my fine lines and this didn't fit the bill at all. I think this product would be a better fit for a young woman in her 20's [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This sun screen reminds me so much of their dark spot treatment for hands (which also has spf) in the smell and texture the only difference is that this doesn't leave your skin fee\ling sticky afterwards it sinks in fast also gives you like a semi matte finish overall decent worth a try if you don't want an spf that leaves a sticky/tacky feeling.

The sample I received was not adequate enough to see results. I will say that the moisturizer did moisturize and Felt very smooth on my skin but I did not see brightening effects after a week's use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I REALLY like this product. It blends in easily without an oily look. I absolutely noticed a ""brightening"" of my skin. One day I forgot my sunscreen and everythinh exposed got a bit pink except my face as I had used the Clearly brighter from Garnier that morning. I am still using the sample because a little goes a long way! My only crtique would be that the scent is a bit strong..not unpleasant but a bit too perfumy. That will not stop me from purchasing the product, however!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is fine. It does what is says it is going to do, but it doesn't have a ""wow"" factor to it. It is a simple moisturizer that will work great for normal skin, but for someone who has combination skin, it does not meet all my needs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Most moisturizers tend to sting my face due to my rosacea so I was hesitant about trying this product out. Luckily for me there was no stinging so that's a major plus. There is a slight sunblock smell but not bad at all and I do feel that the product moisturized really well. I do wish it was higher in SPF but I'll just continue to add my daily sunblock on top of the moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It was an ok product. I did not see any brightening. I do like it for the SPF 15. Great for the summer but it make me sweat and it is personally not good for me being a makeup wearer. Without makeup it is fine. If you are an oily skin person it might not be good. Over all it was just ok. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have extremely oily skin and this product increased the oil throughout the day. I loved they way it felt when I put it on however this just isn't a good product for someone with oily skin like myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really enjoy SPF15 in this moisturizer because most of my moisturizers are without SPF. This one also smells wonderful. I have oily skin and with this moisturizer I have to use more powder like twice a day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love that this is working on my combination skin and not causing me to get more oil in my t zone area. It absorbed into my skin quickly and didn't leave behind any greasy feeling. My skin feels smoother but I cannot speak to the brightening effect yet, its only been a few days of using. It has a nice light summery scent to it that is refreshing. I am very pleased with this so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this during a time the sun is the hottest and it didn't burn my skin from what I could tell. I like that the bottle tells you how often to reapply it.
I do not spend a lot of time in the sun; I am glad I would not have to reapply it at all or very often when using it out in the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm switching my daily face moisturizer to this product ! I like the texture-- it's not too thick or too watery. Feels like it's working without feeling heavy. I also like the subtle fragrance. It's perfect for summer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is definitely a good product for my skin type (sensitive, oily, acne-prone) since it's oil-free. I don't have to worry about it clogging my pores.

"This stuff is really amazing . I have very dry and flaky skin and I use top of the line skin care moisturizer for that problem . I tend to have very tight uncomfortable skin and instead of using my go to product I grabbed this after taking a shower because I was going to be outside most of the day , and let me be the first to say this stuff held up so well , and my skin was baby soft all day . This has been a great product for my skin problems . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the product overall, and will wear it when I am not wearing makeup. It's a little to thick to wear with makeup though. Overall, I'd recommend it if you are in the market for a moisturizer with sunscreen. (I can't address the lightening/brightening claims, as I would need at least a month or so in order to see if there any results.) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was unsure what to expect, because I was not aware of this company making facial products. The lotion is creamy and has a great scent, ge on evenly, needing only a little bit for comete coverage. My face felt smooth and I had no adverse reaction after a week of using the sample. It works well under make up, and does not feel heavy on my skin.

I liked this product as it had a good smell to it and it was a good skincare product. I didn't break out when using this new skincare product so that was very good and it had SPF coverage so I used it before I went out during the day time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think an spf with a low content of 15 is kind of a waste. I don't know why you would want something that low. Why not go for the max protection. I guess I just don't really get the point or purpose of this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I most certainly will buy this product. I've been using the same moisturizer for years and I think it's time for a change. I like the fragrance of the product and like how it feels after I applied it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first tried this product, I wasn't expecting much. Most moisturizers and sunscreens cause me to break out or leave a greasy feeling. However, when put it on, I was amazed.

It did what it said it would. It moisturised my skin and protected me from the sun. I was not a particularly fabulous product but it worked as well as any other. I would not recommend it over other products only because it did not seem to work any better than other products I have tried. I was satisfied with the performance of this product.

"The smell wasn't very pleasant. as I opened it, I felt a waft of something strange hit my nostrils. It was such a bland and weird smell as I was applying it, I almost didn't want to use it until I realized the smell will only be there aslong as it's on my face, so I washed my face and the smell went away.

The product is a good product but I do not feel it offers any other benefits that any other brand currently offers. I enjoyed the product but will continue paying a lower price for a product I enjoy more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This sample arrived at a great time. We were going on vacation and had to be out in the sun a lot. I used it on my face each day of our vacation and felt well protected. I tend to get sunburned easily and never once got burned on our trip! The moisturizer applies easily and stays on the whole day. It wasn't heavy and didn't feel greasy. I applied my makeup over it and felt ""good to go"" the rest of the day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"to use this product frequently, therefore I am unsure if I would recommend it or not, however I've had good experiences with other Garnier products and so this is why my inclination would be to recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've tried many things like this and my face already broke out or became so shiny later. I really like how quickly this absorbs in and no break outs at all. This I think is the first product that I will use daily! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using this product for a week or so, my skin seemed nice and smooth and I believe the product does what it's supposed to. But with many other competing products in this field, it didn't stand out as anything special. If you like to use only Garnier brand items, then this product will do great for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I really liked the size of the sample and think the product is worthwhile, I also need a higher spf because my skin is quite fair. That said, this did brighten as the pitch claimed it would and I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer was just fine. I liked that it didn't make my oily skin feel greasy, but I really didn't notice any difference in my skin. If I spent a lot of time in the sun every day I would probably like this more but it's just not something I need. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the way this face lotion feels. It's super lightweight, glides on easily. My only dislike is that I found the sunscreen smell a little strong for everyday use, thus the 4 stars. Otherwise though, I think it's a very good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked how lightweight the lotion was on my skin and definitely made my skin feel smooth, however I can't comment on the brightening aspect. I have very fair skin and got some sun while wearing this lotion so my skin brightened from the sun...as always lol I guess I could use a slightly higher spf, but since its not a bad burn I will likely use this product to gain color without burning bad. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ok i am very picky with what i use on my face. So i was surprised how much i like this lotion! It is like what i currently use but i actually like it better. I like that it has a sunscreen & it doesn't irritate my eyes. And it is lightweight but moisturizes very good. I will definitely buy this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I probably wouldn't use this product as a daily moisturizer. I'm not a fan of smelling like suntan lotion. I would definitely purchase and use this product for occasions when we go on family outings that involve lots of sun. I like the fact that it's not as heavy in consistency as a regular suntan lotion. Overall I think this is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I added this product to my morning routine. I mix it with my current a.m. moisturizer and I like that it gives me an extra sunscreen boost since I am outside a lot. It goes on nice and smooth and has a nice smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was pleasantly surprised that did like this product because I'm usually very picky with what I put on my face. This did not break me out at all which is always the dealbreaker on any product. I will be buying this to use daily!!! Thank you for the sample or I may not have come across this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The second ingredient is glycerin which is the main ingredient in primer. That's why this moisturizer is tacky to touch use it as ur primer for your foundation see how it goes for u. It works great for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have combination skin, but this daily moisturizer worked for me. in my opinion it doesn't work any better than some of the other leading drugstore brands, but it definitely does what is is supposed to do. Would I recommend it to someone- it's likely, mostly because of the SPF 15 protection it provides. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product smells nice and absorbs quickly with no greasy oily residue. That is always major to me in any lotion including spf lotion. It has an spf of 15 and while I usually prefer a higher spf I love that is is oil-free (no oily residue) and also that it includes an antioxidant complex of Vitamin C + LHA. It includes 3% avobenzone, 5% octisalate, and 5% octocrylene that all act as sunscreen protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use moisturizer everyday mainly on my face before I apply make-up because my skin dries out easy so I really like this moizturizer, because it has sunscreen in it; it saves me time because I don't have to apply sunscreen to my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked this product. It had a very pleasant smell...it works like it claims. It was easily absorbed into the skin and didn't feel heavy or greasy. It does brighten your skin. Overall pretty happy with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The tube it came in looked great. The product smell really fresh and clean. It seemed to remove some of the dark spots on my face, and it made my skin fell moisturized and smell good. I love , love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have yet to purchase this product but I will be doing so soon. Sometimes my skin gets unbelievably dry and I need a moisturizer that doesn't make my skin feel oily. I love this product and I love that it has SPF in it as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Now that my classes are over I'm starting to go outside more. I have really pale skkin and also get acne, so I need to be careful in the sun after I use benzyl peroxide. I tried this stuff the other day during my hour walk and was very pleased with it. Even after sweating, nothing ran into my eyes. Also, no hint of a sunburn! I went out and got a huge container to start using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

My skin is always dry especially in the summer instead of using multiple products to keep skin soft and protected from the sun. Clearly Brighter moisturizer and sunblock accomplishes this in one bottle I noticed the difference after the first week. Loving this sample [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Clearly Brightner Daily Moisurizer is oil free and has sunscreen of SPF fifteen. I'm not a big fan of putting sunscreen on my face because I have sensitive skin. Most break my face out, so I don't use them. Clearly Active contains antioxidants and brightens my skin. Plus it protects my skin from harmful rays. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have combination skin so I used this sparingly on the parts that tend to get a little oily, I waited 30-45 minutes before applying my makeup, however, my makeup went on streaky and uneven. It was a mess! I guess if used alone it would be fine. It did moisturize well and had a nice smell! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really love my current moisturizer, but wanted to try this free sample and see what happened. I was very pleasantly surprised! The moisturizer felt light on my skin, but skin did not feel dry. Face felt great all day. I did not feel like it wore off as the day progressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"seriously love what this does to my skin! i've been having issues w/acne (pretty sure it's caused by my birth control) but my cheek is usually red all over & not even 10 minutes after the 2nd day of application, my bf asked me if i was wearing makeup! i'm so excited, this is the 1st thing that i've tried that has actually helped.(: [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked how light this moisturizer felt. I have oily skin and this didn't make me feel greasy at all. It also has a really light clean citrus scent that is very pleasant and not overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I dnot know if it's because I dosnt use it long enough but I didn't see any brightening with thus I'm not the biggest fan of the snell and I noticed it dosnt moisturize like I right it would I have dry skin and it didn't help at all [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf 15 is a really great product. It leaves your skin feeling soft. It also protects you from the suns damaging rays. I really like this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
With all of the expensive products available I would like for my money to go further and this product does just that. My skin looks brighter already after one week!

"Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf 15 is one of my favorites now. I highly recommend this to anyone. I love how it is light to the skin, no strong scent, and doesn't leave your skin oily. I put this on at night after washing and toning my face. I also put it on my neck, you could tell the difference between the days I didn't put this on and the days I had it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am really enjoying the lightness of this moisturizers. I do feel like my face seems slowly brighter. It feels fresh and weightless. The scent is noce too, i was worried it would smell like sunblock but its not too bad at all. My only issue is applying regularly loli have a habit of forgetting [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While using the Clearly Brighter daily moisturizer, I enjoyed it. I didn't experience the brightening because I don't feel that I used the product long enough. It was enjoyable to use but not life changing bi still recommended for those looking for a basic moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Product moisturizes pretty well and doesn't make my face feel greasy. Not a big fan of the scent of the product, but it's not a total turn off. I would consider purchasing as long as it was affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product once and do not plan to use it again. My face doesn't really break out at all, but it started to after using this. I noticed it stopped once I stopped using this. However, it may be just fine for others, but it's not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very fair skin that is oily so I like the fact that it keeps my face from getting burnt and I love that it's oil fre. I have also seen a change in my complexion, it's a lot brighter and it also moisturizes the rough patches I have around my nose. So all in all Great Product.

I really enjoyed my sample of Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf 15. I would gladly replace my usual Moisturizer with this. It feels very smooth on my skin! Only thing is that I wish it had a higher spf so I wouldn't have to add additional sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This product has helped a lot. I am usually torn between which to use a daily moisturizer and forget the sunscreen or use the sunscreen and deal with dryness. This product has both in one and allows me to have the sun protection I need as well as the moisturizer that I need as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Simply a great product. A little bit goes a long way, and does not make your skin feel greasy. I personally used it most for my face, and was pleased that it did not make my face irritated. I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a simple daily skin care regime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Only 15 SPF but I was out in the sun all day and my face did not burn at all! Right after applying my face seemed a little shiny but it went away after a few minutes so I was very pleased. Did it's job. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product left my skin feeling very soft and smooth. I liked the fact that it also contains a sunscreen. The only negative to this product was the fragrance. I prefer to use products that are unscented. I appear to be in the minority when it comes to fragrance in products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Moisturizers with sunscreen goes on white, have similar scents, and leave a sticky feel. The only difference I noticed was that the white color fade away instead of caking up and making my skin look either chalky or super dry. As for the brightening effect, I did not notice a difference, but my skin isn't in need of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I normally enjoy Garnier products but this didn't cut it for me. I liked the smell and texture but it was awful on my skin..possibly due to spf content..I do however use it to moisturize my hands after doing my beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin looked happy and had a misty glow about it with this product. I love the SPF. BUT my skin is very sensitive and this product wasn't quite right for my skin. I do recommend others try it, though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free sample of this moisturizer, and I love it! I have used Garnier facial products for years and love the quality. I was already using the Sleeping Mask as my night cream when I received this and it is a great daytime cream to go along. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin, and my make up applies well over it. I like the SPF and it is very creamy and moisturizing, without being greasy. I like it a lot. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I expect to have an SPF that is mineral-based, since I have sensitive skin. I also will not use anything below spf 30 on a daily basis. I did appreciate the texture of this product, but it needs to have a higher concentration of actives to live up to its claims. Otherwise, I would purchase this.

"This product is watery to put on. I like the thicker Product. I did like the fact that it doesn't smell like sunblock. However, if don't like the fact it doesn't soak into my skin, but just balled up and came off in ""pieces"" when I touched my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was a white lotion that spread easily on the skin and absorbed well. It had a nice citrus smell that wasn't too strong and faded quickly. I noticed a change in the uneven skin tone and my skin was smooth. It was effective as a sunscreen. I had no irritation and it felt light. I used this on my arms as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like the scent and texture of the cream. I feel like other moisturizers with sunscreen always smell and feel like sunscreen but this smelled great and was very light. I have acne prone skin and this worked well with that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am always outside and exposed to the sun. I usually wear my daily moisturizer but it doesn't really have any protection against the sun, but this product is absolutely amazing. I love the fact that it is light weight and that i smell terrific. I am so looking forward to purchasing it but I haven't seen it in stores yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer provides a thick formula that evenly blends into a very hydrating feel. I enjoyed the light, fresh scent it carries and the fact that it has SPF included in the product. It does not irritate my skin in the least and is able to keep my dry skin under control. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Usually SPF 15 products are too heavy on my skin and reek of suntan lotion. When I initially applied it it felt heavy, but it absorbed quickly and didn't leave my skin feeling weighed down. It actually left it feeling very soft and smelled nice! I used it more as a daily moisturizer, underneath my makeup, than as a sunscreen. Applying it only once in the morning. After time it has definitely helped improve my skin tone making it more even and brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely LOVE this moisturizer! It is creamy, non-greasy and smells clean and fresh. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling and looking brighter and smoother. I received a sample and plan to purchase the full size! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like all Garnier products and especially moisturizers because they are affordable and they give great results. This moisturizer is light and gives a nice healthy glow. The only thing I would like is if the SPF was a bit higher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like that it is a low spf. I don't want a white face and the rest of me a summer glow. It smells fresh and absorbs well but leaves a slight oily feeling. But it did not make me break out. It does leave me feeling moisturized and mixes well with my foundations but with a slight sheen. Over all I was pleased. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The scent was so off putting for me. It triggered a migraine for me , although it is a clean scent like a prefer it was so strong that it was nauseating. Not only that , the minute I rubbed it into my skin , the area turned red which I am assuming is because of the heavy fragrance. It left my face a bit greasy as expected with spf , but not buying again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pretty impressed with this product! I get frustrated with moisturizers often because their either greasy or they make my eyes burn and water. But this did neither and made my skin feel great! I also love the fact that it contains SPF 15! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I like the moisturizer. Non greasy. Goes on nice. Would not buy or recommend to friend because of heavy perfume smell. I look for items that are fragrance free or as close as possible.

"The first day i used this product, my skin did feel a little softer, but it felt weird, and tingly.

"This is a good lotion for normal to oily skin types and not sensitive as well. I have a very sensitive skin and I couldn't use it everyday, but my sister has normal skin and this worked well for her. Overall it's a good lotion and it has spf so I would recommend if that's what you're lookign for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked this product very much because it wasn't heavy as most spf based products are. Also it didn't carry that spf smell which I liked. Also a plus because it was super light weight and didn't clog pores. Love it and will purchase soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After one use, my skin felt softer for a few hours. Living in Florida, it's critical to put on spf sunscreen on everyday on your face. But I have oily skin already and sunscreen makes me break out. But this didn't. So I'll probably buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am normally a fan of garnier, and I know you are not supposed to use around the eyes, but just a little bit got near and it burned pretty bad and for a long time. The scent is only ok, and the sunscreen levels and burning is just too much for me for a face product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I could tell this was a product that was almost not quite good enough for my skin but a better product than most. My skin did not like it completely when I put it on, but no major reaction. I let my sister try it, and it worked much better for her skin than mine. I think overall it is a great product and I will keep it in mind but it felt a bit chemically on application for me.

"Let me start by saying I did not notice a huge difference between this and other moisturizers I use. I did, however, like that this was not greasy and has SPF in it. It also goes on smooth and has a gentle scent. I would recommend this to others in need of a daily moisturizer but did not notice a huge difference compared to other moisturizers, as stated before. It is also competitively priced, so that plays a part in purchasing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received my sample and immediately washed my face and applied the moisturizer to my surprise it was not greasy !!! I live in the far south where the sun is very tortuous on the skin! I have tried many moisturizers in my time but never came across one that can do the job without the greasy feeling!!!! I am very happy!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this moisturizer. It goes on light and doesn't feel greasy like some other moisturizers that contain sunscreen. I did take off a star because it doesn't moisturize the dry parts of my combination skin very well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really wanted to like this product. It has a nice texture and seems to absorb well. My problem was the overly strong scent of the product. I was not able to tolerate wearing it. I tried the product on my hand because it seemed strong smelling. It was difficult to wash off. I was unable to try it on my face. My daughter loves the scent. I give the product 3 1/2 stars because it has the quality of a good moisturizer and my daughter found the scent acceptable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

So I'm very much a addict of moisturizer. I've had many different kinds and really loved them all.

"My skin is very sensitive to the sun, which means I need sunscreen every time I step foot outside. As I kept using this product, I could tell a huge difference in the quality of my skin from what I regularly use. I also noticed this sunscreen is a lot more like a lotion than thick greasy sunscreen. One thing I am concerned about is the SPF level. I have to on sunscreen every couple of hours. Otherwise, the sample is the right size for travel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the product but I did get a little bit of a rash. The product is for brightening and sunscreen protection. I think it irritated my face a little bit as I was itching when I put it on. I did like the light scent though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love everything about this moisturizer! I LOVE the smell, I LOVE that it doesn't leave an oily residue, I LOVE how much better my skin looks since I started using it (which it's VERY hard for me to find facial moisturizers that don't irritate my skin or make my face too oily). There really is nothing bad I could say about it & I will absolutely be buying more when I am about to run out of the sample I have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This lotion is light weight with a very light scent. It absorbed quickly with no residue. I did not dislike the product but it wasn't different enough to have me change from my current product.

"I love that this was a multi purpose product in one- brightening, moisturizing, and sunscreen. I used it after washing my face and it was a light cream that absorbed quickly. My complexion seemed brighter but the moisturizing was a little lacking. I had to still use another cream afterwards. The smell is nice and I would use this one days that my skin is dull or pretty hydrated already. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I was excited to try this out. Its a good brand and a great sample size. At first I thought the smell and texture were weird, but its SPF so that is to be somewhat expected to be different than the gel type lotion i usually use. It however, broke my forehead and chin out really bad. Like the hurtful clogged pores breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"On the second use of the product, I started to feel a burning sensation, almost as if the product was acting as a chemical peel. I was eager to test it out since it has SPF. But, the product made my skin flake off and has taken almost a week for the skin to finally heal. I've been exfoliating with natural sugars and oils to help lift some of the skin.

"I had been using this product for about two months now, and my skin has been looking so clear, smooth, soft, and healthier than before.

Other than the SPF being too low for me, I thought the product went great under my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for about two weeks now and I have to say, I didn't expect it to be this good. Usually facial moisturizers with sunscreen make your face super shiny, but this one had a dewy quality to it, and it helped with my makeup application. The moisturizer itself wasn't too heavy nor too light, and for combination skin, it's hard to find that happy medium. I'm glad to have this product now!

I have used Olay products in the past and always been happy with them. I currently use a premium brand; however I thought I would try this. I was happy that it didn't feel oily. But the scent is too strong for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"For only an SPF 15, this made my skin so greasy. Not high enough to be used as sunscreen and will not last all day for errands and trips outside either. Smells great though. WIll buy something from Garnier without SPF instead. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used a daily moisturizing cream with SPF everyday since I was 17 years old. I've switched brands because some would give me acne, some would leave my face looking oily, others would dry me out, and some were just gross! I haven't stuck with one specific brand other than Olay which works great but the ""clearly brighter and smoothing"" cream truly has left my face with a brighter glow and feeling smoother than ever! I love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do like this product, However, my only concern is that this product seems to burn when it is on my face and all of the ingredients within the product I am not allergic to; so that was disappointing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisture SPF 15. I love that I can get out of the shower and apply my moisturizer, which is also an SPF 15, all in one step. It is a light moisturizer, and I don't feel like it weighs my face down. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first I thought of this product as no big deal just another sun screen product. but It really does what the product is called. right away while applying it, its smooth and light and has a light fragrance to it. It may seem a bit watery to some but I like that for this purpose. It protects my skin and leaves me feeling comfortable. I am so glad I got to try this out. when I run out of this sample Im running to buy a full size! Thank you Garnier [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried a lot of facial moisturizers and this one is very similar to most of them out there. I appreciate that it has an SPF, but 15 is too low for me because I spend a lot of time outside in the summer. It wasn't greasy so that was nice. It provided just the right amount of moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
CLEARLY BRIGHTER BRIGHTENING & SMOOTHING DAILY MOISTURIZER SPF 15 did the job for me on protecting and moisturizing my face. Sun protection is important to me. I recommend this for other red heads with fair skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great to have opportunity to try. Worked well my only hesitation is the smell. I think the product works great but personally the smell is not my preference. I also like to combine color coverage with my SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved this sunscreen. I really do not like sunscreen on my face because it always feels slimy and like my face is suffocation. this did not make me feel that way. I will be buying this again and again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can't really say how this does as an spf, it broke me out within hours and I had to wash itoff. It's extremely fragrant. Really sweet sickening scent. If you're sensitive to scents you won't like this. It is Moisturizing though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Garnier facial cleansers before and still do. I never tried their facial lotions. This is a good product. Felt moisturized without a greasy or heavy feeling. SPF could be stronger though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"On my skin, this came out greasy like a sunscreen product. I didn't experience any brightening or other benefits. However, like all Garnier products, this smells of fresh green tea. I will likely purchase a regular, non-SPF moisturizer from Garnier instead. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way that this felt on my skin. it was really light and i was able to use it daily without it being too harsh and irritating on my skin. i recommend it to anyone looking for a new facial product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved not having to put on lotion and then an SPF on top of it; this was all in one. My favorite thing about it was that it didn't have that sunblock smell. I will definitely keep this in my makeup bag! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It really is a good daily moisturizer. I just wish the spf was a little higher. I have fair skin and use a higher spf on a daily basis so this product just wasn't high enough for me. An spf of at least 30 would be ideal for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the texture of this lotion so much. It doesn't have the lingering ""oil slick"" feel that usually accompanies moisturizers with sun protection. It does help make my skin look brighter and didn't make me break out like a lot of other moisturizers do. I personally love the scent, but I hope they will make a fragrance free version in the future. Then I can recommend it to even those with sensitivity to scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is one meant for women. I'm a man. I gave it to my wife, but she doesn't normally use facial moisturizers (or make-up in general). I'm sure that someone who needs this kind of product would like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love a moisturizer that encompasses everything I am looking for. This one does just that - I like something moisturizing that still feels light. This one is perfect. Especially for summer. I also hate when there is no SPF included. In this day and age with the risks of skin cancer, it seems ridiculous that this would NOT be included. Love that they add the SPF factor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the premise of this product. I use a moisturizer with SPF daily and was looking forward to trying another option. Unfortunately, the scent was a turnoff. I would consider buying this if there was an unscented version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was great. I have dry skin with oily patches, and it moisturized my face without making the oil patches worse! It was an amazing experience to finally find a moisturizer that doesn't leave my skin oily all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried different moisturizers that left my face feeling greasy and when that happens I stop using it. This however did not leave my face feeling greasy or shiny looking and I love the face it has sunscreen built in. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The sample I received of this product was okay. I liked the smell and I liked that the product wasn't too greasy on my skin. I don't know that I noticed the brightening effects but it did make my skin feel soft and smooth. I only wish that the SPF was higher in it but I'd still give it a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"As far as moisturizers go, this is definitely a good one. I haven't noticed any brightening, but it does leave my skin feeling nice and moisturized all day. Soft, too! And the SPF is always nice, especially when it doesn't smell too overpowering. It does what I need it to and I'll probably buy a tube once I run out of the sample! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The day I tried this sample for the first time was just like any other. I used clearly brighter in the afternoon. It was light & smooth. My face was soft & visibly brighter. When my fiancée arrived home, the first thing I saw was him smile at me before saying how beautiful I looked. He had immediately noticed a new ""glow"" about me. It was awesome!

"Love the Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer from Garnier. I have been using it for the past week even that I don't see a much of a difference with brightening I love it-love the citrusy floral scent,the oil-free formula not greasy and it is absorbing very quickly.Like the consistency of it,my skin feels smoother and silky [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturizer! Leaves skin smooth and refreshed. So glad it has sunscreen also. The sunscreen does burn if it gets in eyes, so let dry thoroughly before makeup application. I did make that mistake the first time I used product. Otherwise an extremely enjoyable experience. Very nice sample size as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed using this product, it made my skin soft and not oily. the only downside of this product for me is the low SPF, I live in Phoenix and need a daily moisturizer with the SPF of 45 or higher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i had used this product because i have dry skin and after i wash my face it gets ashy. so i decided to use this on a hot day that i would be out and about all day. to my knowledge it works good you could tell the diffrence with this product, and just washing your face with soap and water.

"I use moisturizers on my face every day, usually before putting on makeup. This moisturizer works well to generally smooth my skin for foundation application, but I didn't notice anything that set it apart from other moisturizers I've used in the past. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer goes on very lightly and leaves my skin feeling super silky. It does not feel greasy or congested at all! It smells wonderful! I am happy that it also has SPF protection to protect my skin on a daily basis as well as antioxidants. I love antioxidants because they are healing to the body! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This leaves my skin feeling soft and I'm happy to find a reasonably priced moisturizer with SPF that isn't greasy. It does smell like sunscreen when you first apply it, but that scent fades quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received a sample for my honest opinion and review. I use Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf 15 every morning and it goes on light and I just put on my make up over it with no issues. Great product, definitely recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this moisturizer. It has an SPF of 15 that makes it good for daily application. It did not leave a greasy feel and did not ""ball up"" under my make-up, which is usually what I find with other moisturizers. I would probably consider purchasing it as my new morning moisturizer if I did not already have one I liked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked it. It has a nice scent and it doesn't feel like it contains spf, which is good because sometimes spf can make a moisturizer feel greasy. This was not greasy at all. It left my skin feeling refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have sensitive skin ad right now I have breakout. I would love to try but an gonna wait till my skin clears out first for a new product. Other than that the smell is like your garnier product. The fact that it has spf iswhat gonna make me want to use it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Iv'e never heard of this product and I'm so happy I received the sample. I love it! It has a great consistency and smell. It did not leave my skin oily and it did not cause any breakouts as other products have. Also love the SPF. Definitely will be purchasing this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's not that I was indifferent to this product, it's just that I didn't see any change to my skin. I was expecting to see at least some slight brightening to my cocoa skin, but it remained the same. I bet it works well for other skin tones. I did like that it was not greasy or left my skin feeling cakey when I put it on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved this product. A great little item in a small bottle. The product was smooth and smelled very nice. It kept my face feeling fresh and clean, and no sunburn on my face. Great job on this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Hard to tell how well this works with the small size. The tube looked nice, product was easy to use and left skin feeling soft. It was hard to tell how bright it left my skin after one use. Interested and may buy it to try more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product works great. It does what it is supposed to do, that is to say microshimmer makes skin look smooth, flawless, and slightly brighter - like many similar products. I love it, though I can't be sure how well the SPF works. However, I can't help but think that this was targeted towards a particular demographic, I'm talking women of color (or even vaguely so). In this white-is-beautiful society, brightening products flourish. Ironically, really pale girls use bronzers. Lol. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found this product to be very useful and overall good. It smells nice, it does not leave your face feeling greasy and makes your face look refreshed. I recommend this product and intend to buy it once my sample is complete. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Not really sure of the brightening effect, as I have only used it for a short time. But I do love the fact that I can use this daily and have the SPF protection. No reaction to the product at all. Very presently surprised, most sun screen daily use products have bothered my skin for one reason on another, not this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i reaaly love the smell and feel of this daily moisturizer. its great to have a lotion you can use daily that also has sun screen added. it doesnt leave you greasy or sticky and is wonderful for your skin while being protective. i would definately use this on a regular day just to protect my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was excited to try this moisturizer with SPF protection. I was disappointed to see that it felt like regular lotion and seemed to dry out my skin more than my regular moisturizer. I don't see the benefit of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wasn't very impressed with this lotion. I've never heard of this brand and really like my current brand of lotion/sunscreen. I currently use noxzema brand. I'm not sure where this Clearly Brighter brand is sold and don't intend to seek it out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"CLEARLY BRIGHTER BRIGHTENING & SMOOTHING DAILY MOISTURIZER goes on very smoothly. I liked the feel of it, and it was not a greasy lotion, but the scent was just a little stronger than I prefer for a face cream. I use one daily, so I was glad to try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Protection from the sun can never start too early. Even though I like having a good tan, I have to watch my sun exposure, as I am already starting to get dark spots. This moisturizer is perfect for me - it allows me to tan a little, without burning from short periods of sun exposure. It has a fresh clean light smell, which is also important. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"after using my free sample a few times, I noticed how soft my facial skin felt. the product has a light fresh scent and its not going to cause me a rash or clog up my pores. it felt light on my skin and was not greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product left my skin feeling greasy and itchy. I have dry, sensitive skin, so I was hoping the brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer would help moisturize my skin. The moisturizer did not absorb into my skin at all, and left me feeling greasy. It started itching my skin and I couldn't wait to wash it off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a very sensative skin, so I am very cautious about trying a new product. This moisturizer is very light, makes skin soft and smooth. This moisturizer wears well under makeup. Good for daily use since it has spf."
"Pleased with product, will likely use it . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So this product that I buy I put it on I forgot that it's sunscreen so that will burn my eyes but besides that the product is great when you put on your face and doesn't get oily and overall I like this product thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product says it all in its name Clearly Brighten Brightening & Smoothing daily moisturizer Spf15 will make your skin more smooth and gives it a nice bright glow and not only that you also get spf 15 sun protection so you are doing two things at once giving your skin a healthy look and protecting it from the sun at the same time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I usually do not use moisturizer as it really makes my face greasy. I found that this one made my face feel a little greasy, but not too bad. I like that there is SPF in it and this would be great for travel and/or being outside for a long period of time. I would definitely buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the feel to the moisturizer and how it made my face feel once it was one. It was light weight and smooth. However I wasn't so sure I cared for the ""apply every 2 hours"". I know it's also a sunblock, but if you wear it as a daily moisturizer you can't apply every 2 hours if you wear makeup. It's great however for no makeup days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Absolutely fell instantly in love with this moisturizer ! I use it everyday before I apply my makeup primer and my most favorite thing besides the spf in it is the smell !! It smells AMAZING !! I love that it also has this beautiful glow to it ! This is my new must have and will be using this moisturizer from now on ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked how only one pump was needed, so little goes a long way! It wasn't drying out my skin and felt good, I used powder on top and my make up stayed on put, no problem. I did not notice any sticky feel in spite of the additional SPF 30 protection. That alone is a truly big thing for me because I hate moisturizer/sunscreen that feel hot, oily and sticky.

"I loved the Clearly brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer spf 15 after only using the sample for two days. That's how much I loved it! Smells good, goes on smoothly, makes my skin brighter then before, and provides protection from those bright UV rays! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Easy to use and goes on creamy and absorbs right away. Non greasy and hardly any fragrance present. Not heavy and leaves skin feeling fresh and clean. Seems to give a little boost to appearance of skin also. Bonus that is contains sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was a great lotion. I was skeptical when I put it on because it went on a little thicker than I expected, but once it sunk into my skin, it was great! I used it instead of my usual face cream, and I loved it. I live in Florida, so I really like that it has SPF protection too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Even in the harsh cold of winter with three feet of snow on the ground, my skin still needs to be protected from the sun. CLEARLY BRIGHTER BRIGHTENING & SMOOTHING DAILY MOISTURIZER SPF 15 was amazingly simple to put on under my makeup and left my skin radient, soft, and protected! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It was a good moisturizer and gets the job done. I'm not a big fan of the smell of sunblock so the fact that this moisturizer does not have a heavy smell of sunblock if any at all makes it a good product and it is affordable since it can be found at a local drugstore.

I received my free sample of this product in my pinchme box and decided to let my teenage daughter try it out. She used it and liked it very much. She said it does seem to brighten your skin up. She is a mixed child so her complexion really looked nice. Great product and she said she would use it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is ok. I like that it has a high spf rating. It goes on easily and does not have a strong smell (important for me). It doesn't feel greasy which is also good. It's a bit runny so I'm not really sure how moisturizing it really is. The fact that it's not heavy may be good for people with oilier skin. I haven't noticed any 'brightening' or 'smoothing' effect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got the sample size of course, but a little goes a long way! It is so thin and moisturizing! It doesn't feel heavy on the skin and it leaves my face glowing! I absolutely love it! The smell is amazing too! It smells clean and fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First off,I will start with saying that this SPF cream spells delicious! I am a stickler for a good scented product. It goes on really light as well. I like and trust the Garnier brand,so I trusted this product to work. I applied it before going for a long walk outside. It was sunny that day but I wasn't out at the beach or somewhere with the sun beating down on my skin. I am hoping it works and so far so good. No sun burns yet!

"I love this stuff, it smells great, it isn't oily and it works great. I have been using it and I can tell that my skin is already softer and during the day my face doesn't feel like I rubbed oil all over it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As a moisturizer it does its job but I feel it doesn't really brighten however as a sample product I do believe you must use it consistently to see results. In the smoothing aspect it does make me face feel smooth! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i really liked the product. it went on smooth and was not too heavy feeling and i liked how it made my face feel. however, i would be more open to purchasing this product if it were unscented. i do not care for lotions, creams, shampoos, etc that have a strong flowery perfumy scent. not sure why a facial moisturizer needs to smell anyways. the scent was only reason i did not give 5 stars [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was really happy with this moisturizer, and I loved that it had built in sun protection too! Too often things with sunscreen in them leave me feeling greasy, but that was not the case for this product. I'll be looking for it next time I need to buy a moisturizer.

"I've been on the hunt for a long time for a good moisturizer for my combo skin - this one is nice and lightweight, contains SPF, and smells nice. My only complaint is that my skin didn't like it very much, as it made me break out :( [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Originally I thought this product was given me problems, because the first time I wore it, it felt heavy and weird on my face. I tried it again, it was light. I was a bit confused but after multiple times it was still light. I don't know if maybe I applied too much the first time or the weather just made it feel heavy.

"I have oily skin that can sometimes get dried out from over washing, I used this moisturizer on my entire face and it kept the dry areas moisturized while actually reducing the amount of oil produced at the same time [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This lotion/sunscreen has its pros and cons....PRO I didnt breakout or have any reactions to which i normally do with most facial lotions seeing as i have ultra sensitive skin. CON It says to put on before applying make up, which i did, and my make up ended up all blotchy and gross. I would only use this product when camping or something i know I wont be wearing much if any make up during [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have oily and aged skin and most products break me out, but this one did not. It glided on my freshly washed skin and absorbed quickly with no residue. It moisturized my skin very well and the fresh scent lingered for hours. My skin did not get oily during the day, nor did it break out. It seemed to help with my acne scars and smoothed out my skin's texture. Very pleased with this product and I will purchase it as soon as this deluxe sized sample is used up.

Do you know how amazing your skin looks when you're expecting? That awesome glow! Well now you can have it everyday thanks to Garnier skin brightening daily moisturizer. It has a nice pleasant scent. It lasted all day for me. My skin tone looks much better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Not only does it moisturize my skin, it has an SPF level of 15 so it also protects me from the sun. I've noticed a difference in my skin since using it and it is definitely for the better! My skin is moisturized and bright and the best part is: no sunburns for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Really like this product, but due to sensitive skin, must put on my normal moisturizer and use sparingly. (Normally, I use a spray on sunscreen per my dermatologist suggestion). Pleased with use, but wish it was not an extra step for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a wonderful product! It's a daily moisturizer, SPF 15 sunscreen. Not only is it not oily as most sunscreens are, it smells fantastic! I don't feel oily and I don't feel like I smell like sunscreen. I will be using this product all year round. Thank you Pinchme for letting me try my new favorite moisturizer/sunscreen!

"I have sensitive skin but tried it because of the name. Big mistake. After the second time trying it, I broke out in a very angry red rash. I stopped using it immediately and it cleared up in about 3 days. I would only recommend it for someone who doesn't have sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I used this product for a week strait, I have acne prone skin and have a good regimen keeping it under wraps. I think this lotion clogged a few pores and gave me breakouts along my hair line and chin. I think it served its purpose as an SPF lotion, but I probably would not purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a decent moisturizer, but it reacts with my liquid foundation, causing it to ball up as I apply it. I don't have any other moisturizers that cause this reaction. I wonder if it's the SPF. This is a fine moisturizer for a light/no makeup day, but I wouldn't recommend purchase for anyone who likes a full face o' makeup on top of their moisturizer.

"As a woman in my 50's, I probably should be using a moisturizer. I have tried the product and liked the way my skin just soaked it up. If you are used to using creams on your skin, then someone will benefit from it's use. However, I have never been disciplined enough to give my face the daily care it probably needs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was never a fan of having a long, daily morning routine. I thought moisturizer was unnecessary and useless until I tried this product. My face feels softer, looks brighter and more refreshed, and it doesn't clog my pores. I feel like I am wearing nothing. I cannot wait to go to the store this afternoon and buy a few bottles of this product. One for me and some for friends once they try mine and find out how great it is.

I work outside everyday and was very excited to receive this product in the mail. Within the first 5 minutes of being at work I sweat off the entire amount of lotion I had put on my face and was left with white streaky greasy looking lines on my face which I then had to go wash off [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I would give this THREE stars (unfortunately Pinchme's rating system will only allow for 2.5 or 3.5 stars). Lotion went on smoothly and easily and felt nice on my skin. I like that it includes spf. I did not notice any brightening or smoothing after using this lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've always had an issue with moisturizers. Most of them irritate my face but this one hasn't done that. It did bother my eyelids a little but then when I stopped putting it on that area, I've been fine since. I haven't been able to notice any extreme changes to my skin yet though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the feel of the lotion. It wasn't heavy or too thick feeling. It absorbed quickly and I love that it has SPF in it! I liked it a lot but found that it isn't necessarily better than other similar products I've used before but I would buy it to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product totally is amazing because it bringd brings back that youthful looking, fresh, & bright complexion that some products just don't do!

"I have to be honest.. I never use sunscreen on my face unless I'm tanning... And at that only sometimes. Well this is a sunscreen AND moisturizer! I moisturize everyday so now I'm finally using sunscreen everyday! It doesn't clog pores, no breakouts, and leaves your skin looking healthy. I'm so happy I tested this out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Yes I did like this product but did not care so much for the sun screen added to it. I am bad about not using sun screen and know this is so bad and that I will probably regret this one day. But I came from the days when we laid out all day with out using any sun screen [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This March weather is just perfect it's not too heavy and not too thick it goes wonderfully underneath a tad bit of makeup and as an added bonus it has an SPF in it which actually helps my skin because I am a very light skinned so very prone to sun damage I'm very thankful that this more strawser both moisturize my skin and actually protected as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product did not get along with my face. It caused me to breakout in little white pimples all over my face. I like the concept of the product but it just clogged very pore it touched. I used it for 4 days then stopped breakout started day 3. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm going to be honest, in that I usually something a little closer to spf6000, but this works great for everyday use and doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy. I burn super easy so I would probably go with a stronger spf for actual out in the sun days, but for the regular commute it's perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have 2 shades of color to my skin, I am either white or red. Thanks to the sun screen it is white this year and not red and painful. I cannot say that it made my skin any brighter or smoother though. All and all I prefer that the sunscreen works, and it exceeded my expectations in that area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really oily skin by nature but I'm also extremely pale which makes sunscreen a necessity. But I hate it because sunscreens always make my skin EXTRA oily. This product while still having a bit of an oily texture after a long day isn't near as bad as usual sunscreens. It kept my face from getting burnt which is really important to me but I don't feel like it had enough moisturizer, probably just because my face is pretty dry after I wash it. Overall think it's a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this product. Its lightweight hydrating, has a nice citrus scent, and really makes my skin tone even unlike any other moisturizer I ever used. I'll definitely will continue using this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This stuff is good for my oily skin and a little goes a long way. It moisturizers without leaving a heavy feeling on your face. I really enjoy this product but the scent is very strong. I wish it was fragrance free. But I would still purchase this product. I liked it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"There isn't a single negative thing I can say about this cream. It makes my face super soft, while protecting it from the Suns rays. I also like to mix it in with my foundation for a clearer less caked look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It looked very much like sunscreen, had a horrible milky texture but had a decent smell. Apply it was easy but it rubbed and flaked off as it was dead skin. Just glad it didn't have coconuty/sunscreen smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The season is changing and so is the need's for my skin. I use this twice per day and I would have to say this makes my skin nice and smooth and hydrates very well. The smell is amazing and the product is not greasy nor does it leave any stains on fabric. The added bonus is there is spf in this as well to protect you from the uv rays! Highly recommend!!

"I use this every single day under my makeup. I have normal to dry skin and this moisturizes and make my skin and face feel alive! The consistency almost reminds me of a lotion and serum mixed together. I don't have to use a lot and it absorbs fast! it doesn't leave my skin oily, but it does feel moisturized. It smells good too. It seems ti have hints of citrus and floral. It has a permanent spot in my makeup bag. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The moisturizer went on smooth, easy, and was non-greasy. It didn't feel like I had anything on my face and contained spf 15 as an added bonus. I would recommend this product to anyone that hasn't tried it yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
keeps my face feeling hydrated for hours. I would prefer cream to be a bit thicker but that is a minor complaint. I think the label could look less basic. It does what it is supposed to do so I am happy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the clearly brighter smoothing moisturizer. I had never used a product like this before and after using this one saw a good change. I will definitely be buying the full size for myself very soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am always skeptical when it comes to skin products but Garnier lives up to it's name. This product is excellent as a moisturizer and sun screen in one and it doesn't make my face oily or break out. I was so impressed with my sample that I went out and bought a full size bottle once I used my sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have very high hopes for this product because i do need some clarity in my face so far i like that it doesn't leave my face dry after i rinse it off. Haven't teally noticed a scent to it. It is creamy formula. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been usin the same moisturizer for years. I am changing. This sample does a whole lot more than moisturizing. I can see a difference in the tone of my face. It is light and not heavy. It smells like you just had a facial! Plus 15spf! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this last Friday since it was supposed to be a beautiful day and I was going to be outside all day. I thought with the SPF 15 and a hat I wouldn't get a sun burn. Well, I got a real bad sunburn so the spf is not strong enough for fair skinned people. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer has exceeded my expectations most definitely. It goes on easily,leaving no film or oiliness behind. Can definitely see a difference in my face while using this. Overall, leaves your face feeling refreshed. Added bonus is the sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought this product would be a good oil-free, light moisturizer for my combination skin. Instead it felt, smelled, and functioned more like a simple sunscreen. Despite being oil-free, it still left my skin with a greasy feel. I also don't need SPF in my moisturizer on a daily basis, so it just wasn't what I was looking for. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"There is one thing I look for in face cream, it's the ahhh factor. When I put it on and take.a deep sigh became it feels good, it smells good nd my face looks healthier. You don't need much so the sample tube gives ample time to try it out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free sample of this product. Normally, lotions that contain sunscreen are somewhat sticky so I usually avoid them. Clearly Brighter was not sticky in the least. My skin felt soft, dry, and smooth after applying. The lotion was thick enough so as not to be runny, but think enough to absorb quickly and completely into skin. I'm not sure if I like the scent, but at least it was light and dissipated after a few minutes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a free sample of this product. The product is more thin and watered down and I would not consider purchasing it again as a moisturizer. I am skeptical that it has brightening characteristics and have not seen those results during my trial. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I haven't used this long enough to decide whether or not my skin is actually brighter. However, it does seem moisturized and smoother. The lotion absorbs smoothly and quickly. There is no heavy fragrance. I like the SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is wonderful. I received a sample of Clearly Brighter Brightening and daily moisturizer and I am very impressed with the way it hydrated my skin and left it feeling clean and smooth all day. Highly recommend you give this a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this sample while vacationing at the beach. I was very pleased that it kept my skin moisturized and I did not have any sunburn on my face! Not greasy and smellls goodGreat product! Thanks for the sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I usually use BB cream on my face because I have extremely dry skin but was really amazed by this cream. It works just as well and really don't have to use a lot to get good results. Usually white creams like this don't really sink into pores but just lay on the skin but this clearly bright cream is terrific. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked it but I still prefer my other brand but its nice to have and keep in purse and use it! The soaps in restrooms are so drying so this was nice to have with me to take that dry feeling away. I would buy this size again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer actually does what it says. I felt like it did help brighten my skin. I also really liked that it has sun protection in it. It has a slight sunscreen smell, but it goes away quickly. I'm 30 and my main skin issues are slightly darker spots and a little uneven tone. This did markedly improve those things. If you want something to do these things, this is a fantastic option at this price point. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is great! I like the feel of it and it seems to ""waken up"" my dull winter complexion. It has a fancy fresh cucumber-like scent that isn't too overpowering and goes away pretty quickly. It's oil free and has vitamin C! However, my only complaint is the low SPF, it's only SPF15. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the way this moisturizer completely hydrates my skin without any oily residue or thickness. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft a day supple. It's a definite plus that it has a soft 15 included! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really was surprised using this sunblock. It seems to be on the thinner side, at first, but a little seems to go a long way since it's so moisturizing. It's also white so if you use just the right amount you can immediately brighten your complexion with a thin layer and rubbing it in all the way. I love that it's also spf. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After incorporating the moisturizer into my daily regime, I can say that It is a very beneficial addition. Because of how well the product works, not much moisturizer is need. It makes my face look moisturized, not greasy( which is a daily issue I combat). There is no overwhelming scent. I honestly love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this daily! I love it, it smells great, I love the way it just glides on my skin, and doesn't feel like I'm wearing any lotion it's so lightweight, and it serves so many purposes on my skin!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am used to using Aveeno positively radiant moisturizer as I have extremely sensitive skin. I was a bit hesitant to use this because I was not sure how my skin would react but I gave it a go and t was great!!!! My skin was extremely dull and after the first use I was glowing!!! I used the Aveeno toner and corrector first and then the garner moisturizer and that has become my favorite combo thus far. I can't get enough of it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I wasn't a huge fan of this product. When it comes to face products I want something light and non greasy as well as something that won't cause a breakout or irritation. This product was very oily, to much of a water texture so it went on very greasy feeling. It stung my face the first time so I washed it off, gave a second try the next day and I just couldn't get over how greasy my face felt. Just not a fan sorry [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer with spf 15 has a wonderful non greasy feel to it. This moisturizer applies quickly and evenly, it not extra thick making it absorb into the skin nicely. Has a very pleasant scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this is a very nice and light mosturizer. I really enjoy how it makes my skin feel. It is not greasy or sticky after applying. It has a nice fragrance and does not irritate my skin. I haven't really noticed any ""brightening"". [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I hate oily, thick facial products. This is not that! It is smooth but thin so you do not feel like you are wearing anything. It also does not cause break outs! Thank goodness! Love it. And also...protects me from the sun! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This sunscreen and moisturizer was very smooth and I especially like the fact that it is oil free. There was no oily or sticky residue and it made my skin smooth and soft. The only thing I wish was better was the SPF as I am extremely light skinned and prone to sunburn. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is amazing, I love the feel of it on my face, it's not irritating which is a plus for me as I have really bad sensitive skin. It is oil free which for a sunscreen product, that is a plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I couldn't tell that it does anything different than my usual moisturizer. It actually seemed to make me break out more, but that could be due to changing moisturizers. I didn't see any improvement over my usual brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a good product. I like the smell and the feel of it, but it's not quite enough for my skin. I need something a little more heavy duty. Thicker. This would be a good product for teens and twenty-somethings. Or a light summer moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
In the minutes after using this products I expierienced redness and itchiness unlike I have before and i do not typically expierience this... i do not have sensitive skin. i was very sad as I was excited to try this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed using this skin brightner and it made my skin feel and smell so clean and beautiful, I will tell my friends to buy this and I will have buy my own as well. Its easy to find at most local drug stores. Garnier is a excellent brand!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great lightweight moisturizer. I did have one issue of not applying it evenly and did have some white streaks on my cheeks. Once I figured that out I was more thorough and found that it worked great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I put this product on my shoulders and neck specifically the left side. I drive around all day for work and my arm gets a burn. I don't like wearing a heavy sunscreen all day bc they are greasy and stain my car. This product is perfect [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is very lightweight, silky, and absorbs into the skin fairly fast. It gives the skin a nice sheen when it soaks in. However the one con I must say is that this product is pretty highly scented. It did not break me out but the smell stood out to me as soon as I started applying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I am sure that this product works the way it should, SPF speaking, I was not satisfied with the scent. It was a little stronger than the scents I like in my facial products, and I did not think it was a pleasant citrus scent. This would be enough to not make me want to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Nice creamy texture, and very light scent. I like that it has 15spf for extra protection from the sun. It goes on nicely and absorbs well without leaving any residue behind. The scent fades as it absorbs. It leaves your skin brighter, smoother and moisturized. It works well on dry patches and smooths them out nicely. I like this product very much and would recommend it. I did receive this product free for n honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been looking for an everyday moisturizer that contains SPF. And I think I've found the one! This moisturizer isn't greasy or heavy, so it's great for everyday. I apply in the morning after I cleanse my face. I haven't had any breakouts with this product, so I'm happy! The only drawback is the scent-while I don't hate the smell, it is very strong. I can still smell it after more than an hour, so I'd advise anyone sensitive to fragrance to avoid this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is such a great product I cant believe I didnt hear about it before!!! I saw and felt results on the first day I used it. I love that it does not leave my face feeling oily. My skin is sensitive and I break out easily if the product is too oily. So far, no breakouts!!! My skin feels smooth and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. Not only does it moisturize my face, but it also has a sunscreen in it, & the sun is terrible for aging your face. I've already purchased this product because I love it so much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After pregnancy I suffered from dull skin and this lotion has brought my skin back to its regular self. I will definitely be purchasing it in the future and I can see it becoming a staple in my makeup bag. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the moisturizer pretty good, but I wouldn't say it wowed me. I do have really oily skin, and I was happy to see that my makeup still went on really well and held up about the same as my current moisturizers/primers. I didn't love it enough to where it would make me change what I currently wear, but I would consider if I needed moisturizer and found a good deal on it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Garnier has won me over again! This product is very easy to use and I hardly know it's there. I'm not used to having anything on my face and it still feels like I don't. Great product for the desert dweller! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"it's a typically lotion, nothing spectacular here. I have a more oily face, so I don't tend to use a lot of moisturizer. I didn't notice any impact on the condition of my face. Still a decent lotion if you're looking for a general lotion though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream was just ok. First of all the packaging wasn't very eye catching and I probably wouldn't have been drawn to it in the store if I was looking for a cream. The scent was ok but I have creams that smell better. I used it a few times but didn't really notice any noticeable difference. It didn't outperform my regular creams. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Immodestly after applying I noticed that it had a pleasant smell. I like that it's lightly scented. It's also got spf of 15 which is great for daily wear. It's also non greasy, which is great for me as I have combination skin. Over all I think this is great, I may consider purchasing after I finish my sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This made my face very dry and peely. I'm sure it did the work of protecting my skin from the sun and all, the only downside was the dryness. I'm better off with something more natural, and do not recommend to folks with very sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was excited to try Clearly brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer spf 15. It was very smooth and light to put on. I like the extra bonus of spf 15. I usually put sun skin screen on and I will use the moisturizer with the spf and won't have to another product in my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this moisturizer so much. It is perfect. I have a very smooth face ever since using it. I will continue to use it. I never liked moisturizer on my face because it is always oily and this is not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked how quickly this product was absorbed into my skin. I liked the light scent. I did not like that I broke out with zits while using this moisturizer. I think that this product would be great for other people to use, just not me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I typically wear sunscreen under my foundation but this caused the makeup to slide off my face. I have never had that issue before. No matter what I tried, this sunscreen caused serious makeup issues. My husband is currently loving it and we would probably purchase it for him because he wouldn't have that issue. ;) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've had very dry skin lately from doing a lot of washing and cleaning. It's been very uncomfortable and sore. I know this says ""Sunscreen"", but I've been using it indoors too. My skin feels more like it should, it's softer and less irritated. It actually feels good. Just after using it a couple of time, my skin felt soft and smooth, and more like my skin used to when I was younger. It also has a very ""clean"" smell.

"I'm a stay at home mom and finding products that are easy to use and quick to apply are a must. This is one of those. It left my face feeling fresh and I felt protected, more so than if I didn't have it on, from the sun's rays. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is a nice moisturizer, light and pleasantly scented. I used it alone and my skin felt moisturized for a long time. I do like a higher than SPF15 for my face but as moisturizer my skin felt good. I did not see any change in brightness or even tone, maybe with use it will do the work. Overall, I really liked the product and will recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"We were out with friends at a local craft show on the beach. The sun was blazing. I was carrying this in my purse. It went on nice and smooth, no oily residue and kept me from getting sun burnt. I love it. I have used it several times. Also a great bonus, a little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After testing it, the only thing that I wasn't as favorable about it was that it had a little too much liquid for me. I would have liked it to be little more solid. But I am enjoying the results of knowing that I'm protected with sunscreen as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have acne scars in certain spots on my face. No brown spots. My face with Garnier Clearly Brightening Lotion did improve. It is the first brightening formula I've used and will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was using the sample and noticed after a week brighter more glowy skin. I have a mixture type skin, oily in the tzone and dry on the cheeks. This moisturizer has been a great addition. I do not get to oily with it on, it moisturizer just the way I need it to. I love that it has the spf in it. On top of everything my skin looks and feels great. Very impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this sunscreen. It gives you a nice SPF, and also makes your skin look like its glowing without oiliness! That's a big plus for me, because most moisturizers and sunscreens make my face extremely oily and break out really bad. This product doesn't do that. This is a definite must have for me now!

"I have hyperpigmentation on my cheeks and I have a feel that it got better since I used this cream. I already purchased the original size, because I think it will be even better after a couple weeks of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What I appreciated most about this product was that it didn't feel greasy. It's hard to find that balance in beauty products, but this is something I will definitely recommend to my friends adamant about sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product absorbs into the skin very nicely. My skin was moisturized all day. I usually have dry patches in certain areas but this moisturizer prevented them from appearing. My face felt smoother and SPF never hurts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I would recommed this product for people who have normal to dry skin. I do like this a lot, it does not feel heavy, I like the spf, and the brigtening factors. The only problem for me is that it leaves me a little too oily, because I have oily skin. I will be recommending this to my mother who has more dry skin as I think she will enjoy this product.

I always need something for the daytime use that is not greasy on my skin. Garnier makes wonderful face products. I apply this every morning to help my uneveness in my skin from acne or age spots.

"Im not really sure what this lotion is intended for. I though it was lotion anyway, but it smelled and felt like sunscreen... I put it on my hands and I dont think it moisturized as well as the lotion I already used. And I have pretty dry rough hands. I just wasnt super impressed. Maybe I used it wrong. is it only face lotion? idk. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A great moisturizer with SPF and the bonus of brightening and smoothing my skin out. It was not heavy which was a surprise and felt light and not so greasy. It was great to have everything basically taken care of in one simple product, instead of using 2-3 different ones. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product did excellent in the sun blocking area. The feel of the product itself was also very great! There was no greasy leftover residue and left my skin feeling very smooth and refreshed. The scent was also another plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been looking for a nice moisturizer with SPF so I was so glad when this came through as a sample. I really liked the moisturizer side and felt protected with the SPF in the moisturizer. I will definitely consider purchasing this producing in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While I do like the brand name of this product, the actual product came up pretty short. I've always thought any type of lotion/moisturizer should actually soften your skin. This stuff actually seems to make my skin drier. I also realize it's supposed to brighten my skin, but I don't really feel like it did this either. All in all, this is not a product I would use again if given the chance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is an awesome moisturizer when you're looking for a little SPF too. It's not too thick and doesn't clog your pores like some SPF moisturizers. I also struggle with acne and didn't notice any breakouts from using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have only used this a couple times since getting my sample but so far I enjoy using it but don't know that I would purchase again. I currently have very sensitive skin with acne so I can only use this product once a week to avoid break outs. I like the smell of this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"How great to have a two in one product, a moisturizer plus SPF15! It's so important to wearing sun protection daily, yet we don't often think about it. Definitely a bonus to have it in a product you use daily! It has a light, refreshing scent and applies very smooth and non-greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am still using this sample, but for now, it is nice, a clean light weight moisturizer. Doesn't feel heavy when applied to my skin which is good. I like the fact it has some spf in it. wish it was a little more tho. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I keep this sample lotion in my purse for whenever I have dry skin and it definitely feels nice. It also has a nice smell, unlike other lotions I've tried. I would buy this product sometime in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I don't usually use moisturizer on my face because it tends to feel oily but as I age I have noticed some drying so I received the sample and tried it its not greasy at all and I do a lot of yard work and appreciate the sunscreen overall I would recommend this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The reason I have recommended this to over 25 people is because I was so glad to receive this sample. We live in Florida and a couple of days after receiving my daughter and her class took an all day trip to Sea World. I had this on hand for everyone and it works and smells great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The first few days I couldn't see results but after using it for a whole week. My skin glowed. Everyone noticed my beautiful skin and I even convinced a few people to buy it. The size was small so I had to buy more but it was worth it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have only been using this moisturizer for a few days but so far i really like it. It doesnt leave my skin greasy and doesnt smell like sunblock either. The one negative i found is that it does have a perfume scent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a nice product. The scent is mellow, it goes on clean and doesn't leave a tacky feeling on my skin. I would be more inclined to use it if it had stronger sun protection in it. spf 15 is not enough protection where I live, if it was 30 or 45 it would be much better!

It felt good and didn't have a heavy or greasy feeling that some of the other products that I have tried have had. I received this product as a free sample and even though I am going to stick to my regular brand I would still recommend it to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product was one of the products I was wanting to try when I first saw it advertise on tv. After trying this sample, I'm glad I didn't go out and buy the entire bottle. The scent is kind of nauseating, and it's a little too thick. Almost like a sunscreen. After using it a few times, my skin started breaking out, and becoming flaky. I was not happy with this lotion in the least bit. Will be sticking to my original moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I packed this sample in my 'camping/beach' bag so that I'd have it handy the next time I was at the beach. I love how it goes on smoothly, is not greasy, smells great and is the perfect daily moisturizer for a day when I'm on the go because of the SPF 15. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this product. Went on nice and soft. No thickness at all. Love thin layer as you place on your face. No shine on face as in other moisturizers. Will recommend this product in future to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not sure of the brightening effect, as this was a sample size I received for free to try & review. I do like the product as a facial sunscreen enough that I will likely be purchasing a full size container. It didn't seem greasy feeling, or make my face oilier. It's a different kind of feel on your skin, sort of like how liquid to powder foundation is. I haven't tried it with makeup over it yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

one of the better moisturizers i have tried. doesn't leave my skin feeling clogged up. feels fresh and not heavy. i would need to buy to see if it works well with brightening and smoothing out my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i really like this product. i took it with me when i went to Israel and it really saved my skin. it kept my shoulders and face moisturized all day and because it has SPF 15 it also protected my skin from getting burnt and eventually peeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is exactly the type of facial moisturizer I was looking for. It feels great, is a sunscreen, and is oil free. All that and it brightens the skin! I really love this product and will be purchasing it very soon. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Being out in the sun regularly it is surely a plus that this is not only a sun screen but has moisturizer added also. I used this and loved the scent and the ease of use. I plan on purchasing more for this summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Everyone says to use SPF on your face everyday but I would never remember. It isn't the highest SPF, but I don't go outside much and I feel the 15 is enough to protect me in the car and walking into buildings. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't like this moisturizer. It says it's supposed to make your skin clearer and brighter, but it went on sticky and clogged my pores, causing me to break out. I thought it might just be switching to a new face cream, but I used it for almost 2 weeks and it kept getting worse. When I stopped using it my face cleared up in just a few days.

I really like this product. I'd been using the Aveeno positively radiant with spf 15 for forever and felt like it left this grimy texture after applying. This one goes on smoothly and absorbs into the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I enjoyed the feel of Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. It went on smoothly, and absorbed fairly quickly. I haven't used it long enough to see any significant changes in my skin. At this point, I would recommend it as a daily moisturizer. I would have preferred it unscented, but definitely enjoyed the overall feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I normally use sensitive skin moisturizers, so I was worried about how my skin would react to this product. I was pleasantly surprised when it didn't cause an allergic reaction, even though it is pretty heavily scented. That being said, it's not as good as my current moisturizer. It left my face feeling a little greasy and shiny (which is likely because it is a ""brightening"" product). I wouldn't reach for this over my other moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Liked this product a lot. My husband and I both try to wear a light SPF every day being in Southern California, and his fits the bill of being lightweight and working as an every day moisturizer. Glad we tried it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked that this didn't smell a lot like sunscreen but it needs to be higher than SPF 15 as that is not high enough to really protect you from the sun. Also haven't noticed any ""brightening"" effects or lightening of my age/sun spots. The lotion is very refreshing and absorbs quickly, great for summer.

"Clearly Brighter is a daily mousturizer with Sunscreen SPF15, antioxidant complex and oil free. I use every morning after my beauty routine. My face look brightening and smoothing. It is a lightweight cream, not grease not stick. It has fast dry and good smell. Definitely I can buy it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's a decent lightweight summer moisturizer, neutral, nothing special. Although, personally, I don't agree with the inclusion of spf 15; that is completely unnecessary: the sun is my friend, and Vitamin D is my friend. If it weren't for the spf 15, I think I'd like it as a daily moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This daily moisturizer works great. My skin feels instantly moisterizer amd it does not feel heavy at all. There is a slight sun screen scent but i personally like it. I use this mainly on my face because i tend to have dry spots and after using this daily i can see a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Using this product made me break out in pimples....I already have oily skin, so that's probably why. This product would be ideal for those with dry skin or those whose skin isn't prone to breakouts., [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I get that this is for daily use but who knows what I might do in the day. This needs to be sweat/water proof. Other than that the product was fine, non greasy and didn't smell bad, still had a slight sunblock smell but the other scent masked it enough. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moistirizer is not greasy but leaves the skin hydrated. It did not break me out as I have acne prone skin. It has SPF so it is great as a daytime moistirizer that you can use under your makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't use a whole lot of sunscreens; I just never have a need. I am normally not in the sun that long to even bother. Seeing as I had some yard work to do I decided to try this product. I wasn't sure how it would work, but it seemed to work well. My arms were exposed so that is what I put the product on. I have plenty left for a few more uses, but I would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is better than my high priced, special order one! It goes on thinly and smoothly while actually soaking into your skin. As someone who is naturally oily, I loved that it didn't add extra oil to my face AND I didn't feel greasy the next day. I wish the SPF was higher, but I can use a separate sunblock if I am out for long periods of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried and use this product for a few days now. I find this product to be effective. It has a light scent that is not overpowering and moisturizes well. I think it is a good product and would recommend to family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a fantastic product! It goes on very smoothly, isn't heavy or sticky. I absolutely love it and intend on making it my new face moisturizer when I run out of my sample and my current product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked that a little dot of the moisturizer goes a long way, it goes one smooth, good protection for my face when I am outside. I also like that it is oil free so it doesn't feel heavy or greasy. I am not very keen on the sent of the product but it does not linger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this moisturizer, it brightened my skin and made it look healthier. It also moisturized well.I like that it has sunscreen too,it wore well under makeup and kept my skin soft all day. Wonderful product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am still in my first week of trying this product, but I must say that I was happy from the start, before even opening it. The packaging is attractive, nice cool colors and the scent is just so yummy. The best part is that it is multi beneficial with the moisturizer and sunblock. I suffer from a very dry face and am hopeful that with continued use I will see a difference. Thank you for the free sample! I am telling everyone about this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It moisturized well enough, and was light, it sunk in quickly. Has a floral scent so for anyone disliking florals, I'd avoid this. Definitely light for daily use under makeup and such. But I wouldn't rely on this for sun protection, too low at SPF 15, using chemical sunscreens that aren't as photostable as others and may cause irritation, so word of warning if your skin (and eyes) dislike Avobenzone, Octisalate, or Octocrylene. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer provided me with the qualities I have been searching for. It leaves the skin soft, without any signs of oily patches and with a slight wonderful scent. The SPF is a great asset as I feel that it protects me from the sun at the same time it freshens up my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product i have been in need of a sunscreen for my face and i love this one . The one problem is i dont like the sunscreen smell , if it had a nice fregrence it would be so much better [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was happy to see this had SPF in it, that is very important in my decision making for moisturizer. 15spf isn't enough for me to purchase it in the future and it wasn't a very quality moisturizer. I prefer 30+ spf. It went on smooth and absorbed quickly though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a wonderful product for people like me who have dry skin . I have to use moisturizer every day 3 times a day . Once in the morning , before make up and after taking it off at night before bed . This felt thick yet creamy and left my skin feeling so soft and the smell was great . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I applied this product before going to my daughter soccer tournament. It was a hot Saturday morning when I applied. It was very light weight and did not make my face oily. It kept my face moisturized and free of sunburn all day long. I've tried other moisturizers with SPF protection in the past but this product was the top of its class! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this product. It feels nice on my skin and not a bit greasy. I have noticed a small difference in the fading acne marks in the 4 days I have been using the product. I will continue to use this product for the forseeable future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer was good. Not sticky feeling after putting it on. Like that it has spread but wish it was a stronger version so that I didn't have to put sunscreen on top of the moisturizer. I did not notice the brightening part but I just had a small sample to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The title says it all. This moisturizer is exactly what I like - light weight, has good sun protection, feels moisturizing without being oily, doesn't disrupt makeup, the only thing I don't like is the fragrance. This product has a VERY strong fresh citrus fragrance that, while pleasant, isn't something that I want to rub into my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
the scent from this product was so strong and perfumey I ended up with an extreme headache. washing the product off with soaps and cleansers didn't remove the scent fully from my skin. I threw it away within an hour of receiving the sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin feels so soft and definitely looks brighter! I love the smell of it and it actually doesn't feel too heavy on my skin. It definitely does it's job and I have already received a few compliments on my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like it so far but I need more time to determine its effectiveness. It smells good, rubs in clear, and doesn't feel greasy at all. Based on those aspects I recommend it but it's yet to be determined if effective as a sun protectant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really wanted to like this so bad ! It felt great going on first then at the end of the day Face started to get little red bumps and felt a little irritated So I washed it off and I try it again and it was the same thing so I just can't use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed this product. I definitely noticed a fresher skin feel when using it. The after results have not left me any brighter, but I have only used the product for a few days. I feel the product has potential and will continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First, I would love to say that I like the smell of it. I like how it moisturized my skin. It did not feel greasy, but my skin felt very hydrated after the first use. I have sensitive skin, so there was a feeling of uncertainty. I felt safe after my first use of this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
it does work but I need a sunscreen with a high spf I found that I sun burned fast and I ended up just using a regular sunscreen if your not out in direct sun and just need a mild spf its a wonderful product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 since it really works! This is the first moisturizer I've tried that actually brightens & smooths my skin unlike any other products I've tried before. I love how amazing my skin looks now (glowing & radiant) and that it has diminished my facial redness that I've tried to resolve forever now. It smells amazing, works amazing and provides amazing results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this moisturizer. I received a free sample from PinchMe and already have it on my shopping list to buy next week. This product smells fantastic and leaves you skin ver smooth. It feels so light and very refreshing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this on my face not only to look better but protect from the sun and I have to say when I was out this past week in the sun I did not get a sunburn or burn like I would normally without protection [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I gave oily skin and this did not make my oils worse. Like that is had sunscreen and the scen is nice and not to much. My skin did feel a bit brighter but nothing extreme but it is a good daily moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have very mature (old ) dry skin. This lotion is awesome. I find it to be light on my skin and it doesn't feel greasy. I have told my friends and family about this. I haven't had a chance to purchase this yet but I plan to on my next trip to the store. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed using this moisturizer. I moisturizer daily and usually use the same brand because my skin is more on the oily side. I would definitely use this moisturizer in place of my regular brand because it didn't leave my skin feeling oily or dried out. It was just right!! :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tend to always like my sunscreen separate from my moisturizer. Usually the moisturizers with spf break me out because they are not moisturizing enough and the ingredients list is too long that I know something will irritate me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this in the mail and was excited to see this in the sample. I am very concerned about my skin and what I put on it. I took a shower and dried off and put this all over my skin. Made me feel soft abd protected. I have bought some since. I wish you would have it in bigger bottles [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the ingredients for the purpose of sunscreen protection, and I will use up the generous sample for that purpose, however, it leaves a very noticable white product on my face, especially around the hairline. If I wasn't so vain about that aspect of it, I would love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was great for under my normal BB cream. It didn't leave my face sticky or overly damp. It was good to have the SPF in it, though for ""real"" sun time I'm sure to put on extra sunblock. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found that this product made my skin slightly more sensative than normal. The brightening effect was there and i did see some results, though i did feel the need to wear more spf because my skin felt tender. I have sensative as well as oily skin so this was not the ideal product for me specifically. The extra bit of sunblock i thought to use made my skin even more oily. I would recomend this to a friend, but only if they dont have sensative skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product. It made a noticeable difference in the appearance of my skin, and I really like that it has SPF in it as well. I used it alone and under my makeup and it worked well both ways. It does have a strong scent, but that does not bother me. I will definitely be purchasing this product again in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"PinchMe sent me a free sample of Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening Moisturizer. Its amazing! It dissolve quickl, not greasy and my skin feel soft, brighter and moisturize. Love it! and been using the product for two weeks and totally see the difference. Amazing product! And I highly recommend this product to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this sample moisturizer..It is amazing..love the way it blends into my skin leaving it refreshed and smoothy soft ...love the scent very natural smelling...Even after being on my skin for a bit it still felt super smooth and soft..highly recommend this if you have dry skin.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product is good but for my skin didn't work so well in the sense that I broke out in a rash. I have sensitive skin but the product itself felt even thick and nice, wished I could of used it completely but at least my friend is loving it. So a plus for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that this is a great product. I liked the fact that it is non greasy. I also loved the fact that it made my skin smooth. It also has a nice smell. I would definitely recommend this product to my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked this moisturizer. It absorbed quickly into my skin and left it feeling nice, not greasy. Is perfect for travel and throwing in my purse in case my skin needs a pick me up because it absorbs so quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i liked this product but i prefer to use one with a higher spf for daily use, i live in sunny California and need better protection. i did love that it was very light weight didn't feel like a greasy mess when i put it on but the only downside it has a scent , not offending but it last a while that just gave me a bit of a headache. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It works pretty good like other moisturizers. It is a bit richer in texture like lotion. I didn't really like that but it did brighten my skin and kept my skin moisturized longer. Another thing I didn't like was that even if I used a small amount, it felt a bit heavy on my face. I could feel the product on me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizor has a very refreshing sent to it. A small amount covers your entire face and neck which is nice because this product will last. I like how moisturized my face felt after without feeling heavy or greasy. The added benefit is the SPF which is crucial to slow the signs of aging from the sun.

"Living near the beach, it's highly beneficial to wear sunscreen. Having lived here all my life I'm sick and tired of the sunscreen smell and feeling as though I'm covered in vegetable oil. Introducing Clearly Brighter SPF moisturizer!! I love that its super lightweight and provides me with the coverage I need. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product moisturizes very well. It does leave my skin looking refreshed and soft. However, it's not much different than the other products I currently use for my face. For this reason I see no point in me purchasing this product at the store. But overall it is a great product and I weren't already committed to what I use then I would definitely buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Absolutely wonderful!! I'm in love again! I didn't think that this product was going to be so awesome. My skin is nicer and softer. I use it in the day and night before going to bed. It's not sticky, but it hydrates your skin so nicely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like that the Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf 15 is hydrating. My concern is will there be a higher value SPF? I have very fair skin and the highest I noted was to SPF 30. I need higher than that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product. Initially, I thought it was a face wash, so, yeah. It seems to work well and after a day in the sun, I didn't notice any sunburn on my face, so I guess it is pretty good. I like the scent. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Its not a bad product at all i think for somone with normal skin jot acne prone akin it would work great, i just have a regimen i use so this didnt really do anything marvelous for me but it didnt break me out or anything it made my skin feel nice and fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is pretty decent as far as sunscreen moisturizers go. I'm using this when I know I will be in moderate sun. My skin has tolerated it well with no breakouts. It is a little oily for me to use regularly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A little goes a long way. It left my skin feeling soft and smooth. I put it on before bed and when I wake up my skin feels amazing and that feeling lasts all day! I will definitely be purchasing this next time I buy facial moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like that it has SPF but I don't quite understand the brightening aspect of it. Is this to marketed in the sunscreen section? The smell was OK. I typically love the way Garnier products smell too. I feel like using it more would give me a better idea of how it works and what results I would get. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used the sample. It went on thicker than I expected. I had to take it off after 20 minutes because I started burning and I really couldn't stand the smell. Not sure if the product works or not--it is not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although I believe this is a trusted brand, i did not have enough product to trust that it works. It seems like a regular lotion. I do not believe that it really moisturized my skin and there was not enough product to believe it does what it claims to do. Nothing posittor negative to say about this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer works pretty good. It leaves my skin feeling good, but I do not like the scent associated with it. I feel like the moisturizer I currently use works better, but I may purchase this for days that I spend a lot of time outside because it has a spf of 15. My current moisturizer doea not have anyou sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What I liked the most about this product is that I have the benefit of two products in one. Not only is it a moisturizer but it is a sunscreen as well. I was born with naturally pink skin that drys out and burns so easily. I have always tried to make sure to apply both my lotion and sun screen, but in honesty, waiting for one to dry so I could apply the other was a pain, so I didn't always do it. Having both products in one is a great addition to my beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Am very impressed with this moisturizer it does have that distinctive garner smell or maybe it's just me that notices that. It did made my skin brighter without drying out my skin and it made my skin smother on certain dry spots over all this is a great moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
this is going to be my favorite of all time ahhh... i like the consistency of this and also how it get blended into your skin leaving your skin moisturised. i have used this product before and I always love it.this is a light weight moisturizer and easily get blended into skin and is not sticky and tacky. so soft to touch . love it. great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It was great for the first few days that I had it on. Once i got my eyebrows and my forehead threaded . I guess the product got into the pores and I started breaking out. I would recommend the product only if you dont have any small tears in your skin. Other than that, It felt great. Not too greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product definitely works as a moisturizer and I do like how it has sunscreen in it but I smells exactly like sunscreen. I feel like I am just using sunscreen on my face and thats it. It might be really good for a day at the beach but other than that, I would pass. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am very impressed with how soft this product leaves my skin feeling. Most lotions with sunscreen seem to leave a gritty feeling behind but this product leaves my skin feeling baby smooth with no gritty sunscreen feeling at all. The formula is also lightweight and breathable feeling for those hot days when your skin really needs to breath. All in all I am VERY impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this sample to try from pinchme. I am always very careful with the skincare products that I use because of my sensitive skin. I am pleased with this moisturizer.

"While the sample sIze was small, it was large enough to try it a couple of times. It was light, didn't feel greasy, and I liked that it had some sunscreen properties.

"This lotion feels and smells like a light sunscreen. However, I was disappointed seeing that there is dimethicone in it, which blocks my pores. :( I really wanted to like this because I have a lot of melasma on my face. There is a slight stinging sensation as well, which I'm unsure of why or what causes it. It isn't especially uncomfortable. I like this product for the scent, texture, and SPF, but I am afraid that is where it ends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer does exactly what it claims to do. I didn't notice any change in my skin on the first use, but after a week, I could definitely tell that my skin was smoother, brighter, and softer. It definitely made my face look better overall. Also, I didn't have to use a ton of the product to get those results. I had slightly more than a week's worth in the little trial bottle.

I like this product. The smell is nice and it makes my face really smooth. Also it's always a plus when a moisturizer is not very heavy. It didn't make my skin oily or break out. I didn't notice any brightening but this is a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

If you're out and about in the sun a lot this is a good one to use. Its not high on the SPF range so if you have fairer skin it may not be as good. It applies very easily and doesn't leave a greasy feel and smells pretty good as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm constantly dealing with dry skin especially in winter from heat in the house but this stuff is really nice no residue after applying and I like the fact it has sunscreen in it living in the south you need it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Front of tube says ""BRIGHTENING & SMOOTHING DAILY MOISTURIZER"" which is what I thought I was getting a sample of...MOISTURIZER!!! After applying to my freshly washed face, I thought, my face feels tight and skin is rolling off in little clumps. So I read the tube again. IT'S A SUNSCREEN!! Not what it appeared to be on the packaging. You definitely need to take a look at all the wording on the tube, way too much and misleading. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

After a few nights, I tested a section on my face which I've noticed is not as smooth as the rest of my face. This small section did not feel any different from how it had prior to using this product. Because of this, I was not really impressed with the product.

I received this product in my Pinch Me box and I am so happy I received this sample. I believe I will now be purchasing this product regularly. I loved this product so much that I recommend it to my coworkers ( I luckily work with all women ) and a a lot of them actually went and bought this product also! This product works great and I am happy that it has SPF 15 in it. It really helps moisturize my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this moisturizer! For years I have struggled with finding a moisturizer that worked well with my skin. This moisturizer smells fantastic and doesn't dry out my skin or make it oily. Be very careful when applying the moisturizer around you eyes! I accidentally got a small amount on my eyelid and my eye burned for about 30 minutes afterwards. As soon as my sample runs out, I will be heading to the store to buy a new bottle. I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product as a free sample. I used this in place of my regular moisturizer. I liked how the product went on. It wasn't greasy and blended quite well into my skin.

This is a great idea to put SPF into a moisturizer and will benefit many! For me I have sensitive skin and finding a product that doesnt react with me is a great feat and I don't switch very often. I think their should be more SPF in this product aspially for on the face with skin cancer and all! But in the end this product might just be a buying point for some with having both products in one!

"I used this the other day when it was very sunny and hot out, I didn't get sunburnt, my skin wasn't all gross and greasy, so it seemed to have worked pretty well.

Used the sample and my skin felt better and felt cleaner. I will buy a bigger bottle to see if it clears my skin better than the product I already use.

Although i am grateful for the free sample of Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer i just did not think this product would be for me. I felt it a bit greasier than i would like my daily moisturizer to be. I did like the fragrance of the product though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I thought the Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer went on smoothly. The scent was really low and pleasant. But after awhile my neck started to itch and other places that I used the Moisturizer started to itch. I got red blotchy spots.

"Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf 15 is a light moisturizer that absorbs easily and doesn't leave your skin feeling weighed down.

It makes my skin so smooth and I like that it has SPF. I feel like I need to continue to use for a little longer to see the full effects on my skin, but so far it seems very promising. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Really like this product! It goes on smoothly and dries well (not sticky or greasy), and my makeup goes on over it nicely. I only use moisturizer with SPF in the daytime, so I'll definitely add this one to my shopping list. The ONLY caveat I have is I don't know how much your product is priced at. I am also satisfied with my existing face SPF lotion (Aveeno), and if yours is priced higher I will not buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not usually a drug store facial product person. I buy Estee Lauder for my skincare, and this was surprising. This moisturizer isn't greasy, nor does it soak in and feel like you need more later. It's perfect. I love how my skin feels after I apply it, and I love how my skin feels still the next morning when I wake up. I will be buying this now when my sample runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was not impressed with this product. Did not like it at all . Just wasn't what I expected. Didn't like the way my skin felt after using it. Didn't like the smell. Had a greasy feeling after applying. I don't like that in a product. I just didn't meet up to my expectations [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First opening I love the fresh citrus scent. The consistency is not thick and feels fresh on your face once applying. I tried this under my makeup and works great. Gives me the confident feeling that my skin is going to be protected by the UV rays. I haven't had any issues with breakouts or causing my skin to be oily. I can see purchasing this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is great in that it has the sunscreen included, so it is less product, better protection for my skin, and serves dual purposes. I love that it wasn't sticky or gummy and really did just make me feel like I was doing something good for myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like that it helped my dry arms, they were very dry and bumpy, no more dry skin or bumps:))"
"I have recommended it to my family and friends.........i do intend to buy but this might be something my kids buy for my grbabies, who are always in the sun.....thanks for the chance to try, very appreciated [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm a sucker for facial moisturizers so I was ecstatic when I was able to claim this sample. It goes on nicely, definitely moisturizes and the added spf is a great bonus to the already awesome product. Another great thing about it is you don't need a lot of the product for a single use so the tube I have will last me at least a few weeks and I will be purchasing it when I start to run low. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this moisturizer after my regular facial cleansing routine. Usually after I cleanse my face it tends to get really dry, but after I used the Clearly Brighter Brightening Moisturizer my face felt so soft and amazing. I love that this product wasn't greasy and I didn't have to use too much. I loved it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My experience with this moisturizer has been going well so far. I love how it makes my skin feel soft and smooth. It goes on very light and doesn't cause my face to look greasy. I also like how there is a subtle fragrance. I will definitely purchase this moisturizer once I finish using up my sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used it for a few days and not sure I have really seen a difference. I don't mind the scent it is pleasant enough. I do love the Garnier products. So will probably get some when I am finished with the ones I currently have at home. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like how this moisturizer also protects my skin with SPF. Also with times use I saw results is smoother skin and clarity with my appearance. Pores looked smaller and light fine lines seems almost diminished. I had really good results with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This sunscreen goes on smooth and is not oily. It has a light fresh smell that I love. I will be purchasing this for the summer to use for a longer period to find out the ultimate results. Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have mild almost non existent acne but I have to be very careful with what I put in my skin. This kind of product always makes me breakout and this one wasn't the exception. I think it would be great on people with active lives (since it has spf) without acne prone skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The quality of the Garnier Clearly Brighter Moisturizer was fine but I couldn't get over the scent. It has the strong Garnier smell that I do not like so much. I would probably purchase it if they came out with a much lighter sweet scent. The texture feels smooth on the face and I enjoy the added sun protection it provides. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have sensitive skin and very picky with products, I tried this and i am very pleased. It felt good on my skin, no greasy after feel, and I did not experience any of the redness I usually get with a lot of products I've tried. I'm definitely sticking to this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the feel of this on my skin. I have dry skin and it left my skin feeling moisturized and soft. Not as hydrating as my usual moisturizer but ibdo like it. It's not thick or greasy and absorbed quickly. It has a nice scent as well. Ill more than likely buy the full size version. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was surpried by how much I liked this product. It has a very pleasabt scent but on top of that i feel like it does brighten and smooth! My skin felt so soft, and it acted as a nice base for make up. I wish it had an option for a higher SPF, then it would really be perfect (for me) :D [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked how the product looked and it helped moisturized my screen while protecing it from the sun. I wish it could also help with dealing with my acne and acne scars. But, it still is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm always on the lookout for a good moisturizer for my extremely dry skin. While I tend to use this product for under my makeup, it will work on its own. I think the biggest thing about it is that it does moisturize a dry face. I say if you have oily skin, it may work for you if you use only a little bit [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I appreciated that there was no fragrance, but I found the lotion to be too thin, too liquid. I tried the sample for 2 weeks and didn't experience any skin brightening or skin smoothing. The face cream was too thin, and too much would come out when I used it. I don't even feel that it worked well to moisturize my skin and I did have a couple of breakouts while I was using the sample. I will go back to using my other daily moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Because of allergies with scents I often have to avoid certain brands or certain types of lotions. With this Garnier moisturizer I had not problem with the scent. It smell a little fruity but after a few minutes I don't noticed it at all. Its soft and cool to the touch and spreads on very nicely. I love how it dries on quickly and doesn't leave my skin oily or shiny. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Though I was excited to use this moisturizer because Garnier is one of my favorite brands, I couldn't get past how strong the fragrance was. Since this is a daily moisturizer I don't understand why there's a need for a strong, perfume-y scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I don't have a problem with this product. While using it daily I just couldn't tell a difference after using it. It moisturized a little but not any better than the moisturizer that I'm currently using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is of good quality. It smells good and makes your skin feel very soft but if you're looking for one that protects your skin, this product has a ery low spf so it will not quite do the job. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this moisturizer, I usually use garnier mositurizers without spf and so I took a break from those to try this. I use it at night before bed and in the morning before makeup. It goes on great under makeup. The only thing I'm not thrilled about is that my face feels the tiniest bit greasy by the end of the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this product. I have sensitive skin and it didn't irritate my skin at all. It probably won't knock out my favorite facial moisturizer but I'll definitely consider this as an option if my other moisturizer isn't available. Worth a shot if you want to try something new. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This sample size is perfect for my life right now. we have been on the go and I can just throw this in my purse and go. The fragrance isn't overpowering, The cream feels like water and it absorbs quickly. This is definitely a future purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this for a week at nighttime after washing my face. I have oil skin but still try to use a moisturizer because I find my skin is more balanced and breaks out less. This sample was simple and great. My skin felt awesome and I didn't break out, plus the smell is really nice. Bonus is that the price point is much better on this product than most. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using this product last week, and I absolutely love how much my skin brightens up after using this! I use it in the morning, and right before putting my makeup on. This product is so amazing I recommend this over a primer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer was nice going on. It stayed slightly tacky longer than I like but once it absorbed it made my skin feel nice. It may be the spf in it but unfortunately it ended up breaking me out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked this moisturizer. I did notice a brightening effect and I liked that it has SPF in it, but I prefer a higher amount since I have had skin cancer. I would purchase in a pinch. It does have a strong fragrance if you are sensitive to that as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think it is a good product but I have not been able to test it in the pool as that is my main use for it. I seem to burn easily the first few weeks of sunbathing and swimming. I think this product would work nicely for my face as that is the main area I need to protect. I'm not sure if it is supposed to have other health benefits to the facial skin but that would be an added benefit if it did. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was a nice lotion that I didn't mind putting on in the morning. It isn't greasy, it doesn't stink, it isn't heavy. I didn't wear makeup over it so I wasn't sure how well it pared with that. Didn't really see any ""benefits"" to using it. Maybe I need to use it longer than a few days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Okay, so sunscreen is a daily part of my skin care routine! And this sunscreen was perfect to add on before my foundation. It didn't have that icky sunscreen smell, it was light, and it wasn't overly oily. So, I was pretty darned happy with the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i found the smell of Garnier Clearly Brighter to be very relaxing. As i messaged the cream into my skin i felt the lack of the thick layer of oils that i get from other products like this. as well it did truly make my skin feel smoother. I was surprised by the fact that it could also still act as a SPF 15 with out the extreme amount of oily feeling i have become so accustomed too with other brands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Garnier skincare and it being a brightening SPF makes even that much more better. It's to soon to see if it really brightens my skin but I love it already.it has a wonderful smell, doesn't feel greasy and it soaked into my skin quickly without a sticky feeling or leaving my face all white. I highly recommend no matter what season!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do like the spf in the lotion, wish it was a bit higher . But this is a convienient product for someone who just needs to maintain skin! I would recommned this to my 18 year old daughter. It smells good, absorbs well, has spf 15 and didnt make me break out ! What's not to like, also the sample was huge so thank you for that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Okay so i have so much trouble finding a moisturizer for my face because i have such terrible dry skin and i apply make up daily which makes that worse from washing it so much. I like to put this stuff on before applying my make up and it leaves a photo finish look on my face with a healthy glow! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product works great and is really nice. I already have a similar product that I have a lot of and the scent didn't mesh well with my current products. I love everything about this product except the smell. I would recommend it to anyone though if they like the smell. I might buy it in the future if a different smell comes out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was very happy with the way this moisturizer left my skin feeling and looking. My skin was soft to the touch. My face looked brighter and felt smoother then ever before. It has vitamin C to aid in the appearance of the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product because it combines 3 products into one and being a busy Mom products like this are a lifesaver! I don't have to sacrifice my care and get good results in half the time. This moisturizer kept my face from drying out and on days O didn't use makeup it was nice to know my skin was still protected from the sun's harmful rays. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"great moisturizer, light and absorbs quickly into the skin but it has fragrance in it. its a light scent and it smells nice but if you have sensitive skin, this is not for you. I wish that they would make a fragrance free one and spf 15 is not enough, I wish they would have put a higher spf. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Out of the three daily moisturizers with 15 SPF that I have used, this seems to be the lightest. I have fairly oily skin and the sunscreen within the moisturizer often makes it worse. With this product, I did not experience an oily feeling, even after applying make up over top of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first the i tried it seem to make a difference in the dark spots that i have. The more i used it my face seemed to even out the dark spots. The smell is ok, not to bad . The texture is smooth and it is a little oily but does the trick. I will definitely be purchasing this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is now one of my favorite skin care products. Some moisturizers are too harsh for my skin but I like how this feels and I want to keep using it to see better results. Be careful, don't apply around the eyes, I have allergies and I have to be careful and this is not the exception. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product irritated my face. I experienced redness and bumps. I have very sensitive allergy prone skin, but this product is scented which increases the likeliness to cause skin reactions. It has a nice creamy texture and does have a slight cosmetic brightening effect initially (before the redness and itchy irritation). I would not recommend this if you have sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was fully expecting for this moisturizer to feel greasy on my skin. Every sunscreen that I have ever tried, even the ones that claim to be ""non-comodegenic"", still feel very heavy, oily, and overall unpleasant. This product, however, does not! It feels very lightweight, and I would be willing to use it as a daily moisturizer even if it didn't have the sunscreen. I give this product two-thumbs up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"One of the best moisturizers I've tried! It is super easy to put on, blends in to your skin right away and leaves it feeling nice and refreshed, not heavy like some that I've tried. Has a nice, light fragrance. Also love that is has SPF in it, since my makeup doesn't have SPF. I will definitely be buying this in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"As I am allergic to sunscreen products and many products containing SPF, I let my daughter try this one out. It applied smoothly and absorbed into her skin well.

"I liked the smell and feel of this lotion. Unfortunately by the second day, it was clear that I was having a reaction to something in the lotion. I broke out in a bumpy rash on my cheeks and neck.

"Just as a lotion its perfect! The sun block is a bonus. My husband likes lotions more liquidy and I like them like goldbond thick. We are now depending on price difference going to switch to this because its the perfect medium. Not to oily or to thick ,and its not watery at all! It smells AMAZING. I put it on every hour just to smell it haha.my kids did too. Thank you pinch me for finding a new lotion for our family! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was really apprehensive about using this product since I tend to have sensitivity issues with products for my face, but I found that it worked out really well. Not only did I not have any problems with this, but it felt really nice on my skin. The scent and texture were just right. I even applied this to the back of my hands too and it really did make them look brighter and less dull than they were. My face feels great and I definitely think this will be a product that I will be using again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

My skin is very oily on my T-zone but this product is oil-free and has left my face looking great. Most of the face moisturizers leave my face oily and greasy. My face is a lot smoother and well protected with an SPF of 15 and vitamin C. Vitamin C is great for your skin. I am out in the sun a lot because I love to run and this product has not irritated my eyes like other moisturizers when I sweat. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I would need a little more time using this product, to give a 100% accurate review. But the week that I did use it, made my face nice and soft, didn't seem to clog my pores.

I usually am mostly neutral on any sample moisturizers I receive for my opinion since they're often for different skin issues than I care about (i.e. Aging, splotches), but this one is great.

"I really wanted to like this product because I love moisturizers with sunscreen. I was hoping it could replace my current moisturizer without sunscreen.

"This is a great product! I really think that it moisturized very well and it seemed to have brightening effects. I love that it didn't clog my pores because I have sensitive skin.

Goes on smooth and stays in place all day. Noticed a difference in the brightness of my skin. I have some darkening on my nose from sun exposure and it brightened it up rather nicely.

I used this product daily for several days and saw no difference in the appearance of my skin. I did end up with a few blemishes in the area I used it.

"This is a great product. It's a moisturizer with SPF too. It works well but I do have a couple complaints. First, the SPF is only 15. Second, it doesn't smell great to me. It smells more like a sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved using this product! Just adopting it made me feel more energized and awake. After using it for about a week it made my skin look brighter and healthier. Everytime I apply it, it makes my skin feel hydrated. It's a creamy moisturizer, that's not to thick or to thin. Its easy to use, and you'll love the way it makes your skin feel. I received this product free sponsored through pinch me in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Whenever a moisturizer acts also as a sunscreen, I immediately believe that it's going to be thick or/and greasy. Surprisingly, this product was neither! Loved that it wasn't pasty white and that the scent was pleasant. This will be the next sunscreen I purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is nice for those days you know you'll be spending all day in the sun. But not for everyday use. It was like applying just sunscreen to my face.

It did was it says it did though, it protected my face and moisturized it but was too heavy and a little greasy for my taste. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Ok, yes I know that SPF 15 is in the title, but it's smell and texture are closer to sunscreen than moisturizer. I found that for my skin I had to wait a few extra minutes for it to absorb in to my skin before I could put makeup on. It does feel very clean and light once it is dry though.

"I wanted to like this product, I really did. I am always on the look out for new sun protection lotions. This one, however, caused my face to freak out, likely due to an allergy to something in the lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been trying many kinds of facial moisturizers and I LOVED how this made my face feel. I also love how a little goes a long way! Means it will last longer! Very happy and I am so glad for this sample because I know I would pay full price for this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The smell alone is worth buying, but finding a moisturizer with sunscreen that doesn't feel thick and tacky is amazing. I've only used a few times but already I like it much better than both my cerave and cetaphil moisturizers with sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As a cancer survivor I'm always concern about getting any type of cancer again. I would usually wear hats not be in the sun long. This SPF moisturizer helps keep my skin smooth, healthy looking while protecting my from harmful UV rays of the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the feel of this moisturizer as I applied it. It went on smoothly an made my skin feel good. My skin might have seemed brighter throughout the day, but I didn't really notice anything super dramatic. I love the fact that this moisturizer is also SPF 15. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product totally surpassed my expectations. My skin was left moisturized, smoother, and brighter after a few days use. While i wish it had more spf in it, i felt that my face was clean, protected, and ready for the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"One of my favorite thing about Garnier CLEARLY BRIGHTER BRIGHTENING & SMOOTHING DAILY MOISTURIZER SPF 15 is its light formula, my skin absorbs it in seconds and it doesn't leave you a greasy sensation plus I can really feel how my skin is moisturized during all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm so in love with this moisturizer. The feel the smell all of it. It don't leave your face feeling all greasy. And never once broke me out. I can't say enough good things about this product. This will be my go to moisturizer from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin burns very easily, and almost every day I come home feeling a little fried. This product was just the perfect amount of protection, it kept me from burning, felt very fresh, and didn't leave an oily film. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Having spent too much time in the sun with too little sunscreen, I have developed some uneven skin tones on my face. I have tried various products, trying to even out the tone of my skin, with little luck. While the sample was only enough for a few applications, I already feel as if my skin tone is more even. I've even been told it is ""radiant."" Good product that may be great - I will have to purchase some to find out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Since I had an allergic reaction to the sunscreen, I cannot make a recommendation for someone else. But that's not to say it's not a good product. You'll have to try it yourself and make up your own mind if it's for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this stuff! Not only does it moisturize, but the smell is clean, and after I tan, I put this on and instantly it brightens my skin. It also has sunscreen so I do not get too much of the rays. I recommend this to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This left my face feeling soft and not greasy. It has more of a traditional sunscreen feel to it but I would not use it as my primary defense against the sin. It felt light going on and was still able to apply my makeup over it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product really did leave my face shiny in a good way! It was very moisturizing but I think that the fact that it was a sunscreen as well made me not like it as much because it had a very ""thick"" sunscreen feeling when I had it on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very excited to try this moisturizer by Garnier. The sample was generous in size which I very much appreciate. What I did not enjoy is the extreme amount of fragrance in this product! It smells like straight up perfume- and not in a good way! I would NEVER apply something like this to my face because fragrance is so irritating to my skin and as a migraine sufferer I would have an immediate headache!

"This facial lotion goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. It leaves your skin soft and radiant after the fist week. The SPF in it is an added bonus. Use it as your morning face cream, you won't be sorry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter and I really liked the way my skin felt. My skin felt smooth, but not greasy. The fact that it will help protect me from the harm caused by the sun, such as sunburn and skin cancer is a real plus. This product does it all from making your skin feel nice to given you the protction you need from the sun with SPF15. This is a great product which I will recommend to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used it about 4 times already this one was good side, still some left over I love the fact it doesn't have that nasty smell to it like other sun screen does. Thank you Pinch me for this free Sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Garnier's Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf 15 is a nice facial moisturizer. it applies easily and doesn't have a strong scent. It moisturized my face for the whole day and protected it from the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this cream on my face for about a week. It has a pleasant scent and it feels very nice on the skin. I didn't notice any difference in my skin after applying though, and would assume it's not very special. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The first time i used this product i already noticed a change in my skin. It felt so smooth and it looked radiant. I was very please how it made my skin feel nice and smooth and refreshed and it didnt break me out or make me oily. I love this product a lot and am planning on purchasing when i get the chance:) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed this product. I felt like the consistency was perfect as it was thin but really hydrating (I tend to get dry, but no problems with this product). Smell was fresh and non-greasy feel. Added benefit with SPF. Enjoyed the product and will considering purchasing when my current moisturizer is empty. Thank you, Pinchme!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product i like. Had before this sample as well. So i have been jsing it for a while i dont know that i have seen a difference in face looking brighter but it looks a little healthier not so dry enjoy the scent doesnt make me break out and a lot of these moisturizers do i would reccomend this but it is a little pricey.

"Garnier has come out with a line of products that makes me feel great about my skin care. I currently use several other products from garnier but I am most excited about this daily moisturizer with SPF. It goes on smooth, does not leave my skin greasy and prevents sunburn on the average day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have no negative comments on this products. It absorbed well when I put it on. Would prefer a little thicker cream. Just feel like there are plenty of other creams available already on the market. I would not buy this product for myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I suppose any lotion makes your skin smooth, but this sample was way too tiny, to tell if it caused brightening. Id need at east a weeks trial, to be able to tell. Just being honest. Did make skin/it smell nice, however! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As a fair skined person who burns crazy. I love this product because it's just enough spf to be safe but it's not cakey it still smells gross like Sun screen. Looks great under makeup I also mixed some foundation with it for lite makeup days [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is so weightless and feels great on the skin, I noticed it gave additional glow and blending to the liquid makeup I already use and didn't dry my skin out by mid-day. I do carry it in my bag so I can always have a little touch up if I am feeling unbalanced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So not greasy, love that it has vitamin and lha in it.i used this for a day and haven't had a break out!(that's a plus) it takes a bit to skink in the skin but after it leave it smooth and light. love the scent also. good size sample so ill be using it again until I have to get a full size! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer for the past week. First off, I love the subtle smell of the moisturizer. It does not leave my face feeling oily or as if there's a slight film on my skin like some moisturizers do. I would definitely recommend this thus far. I will continue to use it and will most likely end up purchasing once the sample runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I felt like it was just another typical sunscreen for your face. It was pretty moisturizing, which is a big pro for me. However, i already own a BB cream with sunscreen and moisturizing benefits in it, so I feel like this product is not something I need. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
If I run out of my other product I may use what I have left of this. I can't complain of the product itself but honestly I didn't find anything that stood out about this product. Didn't feel that it was long lasting and it should be. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like it. No greasy feel, and sunscreen built right into a daily moisturizer! I haven't been able to see how well the sunscreen works yet, but I burn so easily it will be nice to not have to worry as much if I forget my usual sunblock. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I haven't used this product for long enough to know yet if it truly brightens skin. It did go on easily and was not overly oily. I wish it had a higher SPF though. I wouldn't use this without it being SPF 30. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I usually hate all sunscreen because I can not stand the smell of it or how it feels on my skin. However, this stuff smells great to me and it makes my skin feel smooth, but I can not feel the product on my skin which is fantastic! It seemed to have little specks of glitter in it to brighten up the skin, but I love glitter so that does not bother me! I have not used this outside for extended periods of time to test how well it is when in the sun, but I love this product so much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the way that this product moisturized my face. It was not heavy and had a light but pleasant scent. I'm not sure that it cleared or brightened my skin, though. Perhaps I just didn't get to use it long enough from the sample size to notice a difference. It moisturized very well but I'm undecided about the other product claims. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm not going to give this a bad review because i feel that the biggest issue I had was the fact that it smelled so strong and that it was sticky. I'm going to used what I was sent until the end because I dont hate the product I just dont feel that I would buy this item for myself. I would like a friend know that its good but that these are the cons that I found for myself and if they still want to buy they can. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Unfortunately, the moisturizer made me breakout. However, my skin is very sensitive and I've only been able to find two moisturizers that don't break me out. Other than that the product is good. It didn't make my oily skin get greasy, kept it sufficiently moisturized and I like the fact that it had spf, vitamin c, and LHA. If the product had not broken me out I probably would have bought it when I ran out of my usual moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was in desperate need to find a sunscreen that I could apply to my face which this product worked really well. It did not leave my face feeling greasy which most sunscreens do since I have oily skin. It did not feel heavy which I loved. I will very likely buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was hesitant to try as most sunscreens that say not oily have an awful scent... but this one, besides having a nice smell and texture while applying, it left my skin super super soft, couldn't believe that it would be that soft wihtout feeling oily [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Its a good moistener, very inexpensive something i would use when i dont intend to spend alot of time outside. i like my moisturizers to have high spf because iv pale burn really easy if in the sun for any lengths of time [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
At first when i got the product I wasn't sure if I would really like it. But I began to use it and I really did like it . It's both sort of a face lotion but it also protects you from the sun .really good product . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
when i seen the image an it was up for a smaple i instanly grab it i was running out of moisturizer and it came i soon when i ran out but its actually a sunscreen but a moisturizer to so i was happy to bc we was leaving to go to the beach . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i already use this product but the version with spf 30. it is lightly scented without a strong smell of sunscreen. Absorbs quickly into the skin and doesnt look greasy. It also doesnt crumble up under makeup which is a plus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Such a great product! Like all new moisturizers, I get very weary they're going to make my skin more oily than it already is. It's worked really well though! I've been using it for the last 6 days under my matte foundation and it hasn't given me any grief, just smooth/moisturized skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My car attracts the sun like no other, and I was in need of a sunscreen for my face that wouldn't clog my pores, so I grabbed this and i felt immediate relief from the sun and it felt very weightless. I intend to purchase this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Very moisturizing, feels just like sunscreen. My only concern was it made my face feel more oily than usual. I have extremely oily skin. I can see this being a wonderful product for those with dry or average skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is close to what I was using. Has the same ingredients and everything. It smells good! Fresh, clean like. It protects my face against the sun and does brighten along with it. Liked it a lot. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It smells lovely. It leaves my skin feeling moisturized. I like that there's an Spf in it. Works good under makeup. Can't say much for its brightening and smoothing claims as there isn't enough in the sample to actually see results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the results I'm seeing. I've been using it for two weeks now and I'm already seeing a reduction in redness, a more even skin tone and a brighter more vibrant complexion. My face is more moisturized and I love that it contains an spf. The scent is very nice a light, ckean, almost floral scent. My new go to moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This sunscreen did not seem to be too different or outstanding from any other sun screen. It was also only SPF 15 which I feel did not protect my skin very well. The only positive thing I would say about it is that it did seem to leave my skin a little bit more moisturized than usual. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Like the benefit of having a sunscreen in a moisturizer. It goes on the face and blends right in, leaving my skin smooth and non-greasy. My biggest complaint is the scent! It is overly floral scented, something that I don't care for in my skincare. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First thing I noticed was the smell. It had a strong smell of sunscreen which is to be expected with a product with sunscreen, but the scent doesn't go away once applied. I constantly smell sunscreen throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a history with acne and have oily skin, so i'm very particular about the face moisturizer i use. while this was fine (and cheaper than what i use now), i am very satisfied with the lotion i use and it works perfectly with my skin type. i see no need for this in my life. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is not bad, I just don't like the feel or smell of lotion on my hands, at all. I'd say it is worth the money and does a good job of giving you soft skin. The fragrance is nice light scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is great for oily skin types. I am always afraid to try new moisturizers because no have oily skin and they tend to make it worse. But this one goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. There is no like feeling and make-up goes on great over this. I love this product My new favorite moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this product before the sample from PinchMe came. I got a sample from a friend and immediately fell in love with Garnier CLEARLY BRIGHTER BRIGHTENING & SMOOTHING DAILY MOISTURIZER SPF 15! I love how soft my skin was after the first use and couldn't wait for this larger sample to arrive! I plan on purchasing this product when next I am at the store. I've recommended this to all of my family and friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have dry skin not the worst but I hate using lotion because I feel like I can feel it on me for too long after I put it on. This lotion soaks in perfectly. after putting it on it only took a few minuets to feel like it was just my skin being more moist and not just like I was swimming in lotion. I feel like this is the perfect lotion for people who don't like lotion, but need it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My face is extremely dry and it only gets worse as the summer omonths come. I love that this is a two in one moisturizer and spf. Makes its simpler to get ready knowing I'm protecting myself from the sun! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I found this product to be a little heavy and greasy feeling. I do like the amount of sunscreen. I tend to not use a daily moisturizer because my skin is oily and breaks out easily. So far, there have been no breakouts, but it feels oily on my face. I would like something with less oil and lighter feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is one of the better moisturizers I have used. It smells great and makes your skin soft without being greasy. I like that it jas spf in it to help keep my face from getting too much sun. I would definitely buy this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This stuff is great! Feels nice on the skin, doesn't break me out and makes my skin feel nice. Has a nice, light citrus scent to it which I like. I don't think I've noticed any brightness in my skin but I definitely like this enough to purchase and recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the Garnier brand in the past but fell out of love with it because the moisturizers I was trying were not working for my skin. They were making me break out and leaving my skin dry and making my makeup cake on my face. This moisturizer left my skin bright and supple. I didn't even have to put make up on afterwards. And SPF protection always appreciated! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Really liked this product I've had issues with miosterizers even the ""no oil"" type leaving my skin greasy and noticeably shinny as well as clogging my pores. This on the other hand is smooth right from the start once rubbed in there is no appearance of its existence, no tacky greasy feeling and it also smells fantastic [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to try this sample that I got from PINCH ME as I am looking for a moisturizer. However, when I put it on, it felt extremely heavy on my skin. Almost like I would have breakouts because it wasn't soaking it. Maybe my skin type isn't suited for this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all this stuff smells great, normally any lotion with SPF in it smells like sunscreen but this has a lovely sweet aroma. It also doesn't have a heavy feelings like most SPF lotions. I love this and will probably replace my current lotion with this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"That's what my face felt like after I put on Garner SkinActive Clearly Brighter. I love that it's a moisturizer with SPF15. It has a pleasant scent that reminds me of the beach, which is a good thing as I am an Island woman. I like that it doesn't feel oily afterwards. My face felt soft and smooth after a generous amount of application. It's made in the USA so we're supporting local. I'm pretty happy with this product and I'd recommend it to family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love how this moisturizer makes my skin feel, and especially how it has SPF 15. It currently has been hours since I put this product on after washing my face, and I still feel very refreshed. Definitely worth the purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer went much further than I expected it to. When I squeezed out the amount I use with my regular moisturizer, I ended up with way too much! But that's a good thing, because it means I get a lot more value out of this product. My skin feels very moisturized, and the SPF is a nice bonus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I live in Arizona and it not only gets hot here but it is very sunny so sunscreen is needed, but the smell of sunscreen can be horrible. I actually love the smell of this product and don't mind using it on my face, it also absorbs well into the skin and spreads out well. I will be buying a full sized bottle of this to use this summer. This product doesn't leave my skin feeling oily or greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this as my daily moisturizer now for a couple of months and have been very pleased with the results. I discovered it in a survey I did for it and after finishing with that have continue to purchase it for my daily use. Nice light aroma, feels smooth and not oily and doesn't have an oily residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I first put this product on I loved it. It was thin enough that it went on smoothly without leaving my face shiny and it did not leave my face or hands feeling oily. However, several days after I started using this product my skin started breaking out. I also used this on my chest for added SPF when wearing v-necks and I broke out there too, which I never do. If I didn't have sensitive skin I would use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't typically like Garnier products but this face lotion has changed my opinion. I'm prone to getting oily toward the end of the day, depending on the moisturizer I'm using, but with this one I don't. I don't notice a scent, so if there is one it's not overbearing, and it doesn't irritate my skin at all (I'm sensitive in the upper cheek/under eye area). I also like that it has SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like that it smells nice and it's not greasy. It feels more like a hand lotion than a sunscreen and I really like that. I still have some of the sample left and I use it as needed and I still find myself liking it. I'll be buying it once I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this moisturizer and fell in love it has a light fragrance that smells fresh and clean and it is not oily and the best part my hands really feel moisturized and it's got a spf 15 sunscreen on top of all of that! I will definitely buy in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer is great!! It is not heavy at all and leaves your skin feeling smooth and looking bright. I love that it also had SPF 15. I am switching to this as my primary moisturizer immediately!! I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love it! I recently purchased another skin active product -the charcoal cleanser and both products really do make my skin brighter and nicer. The moisturizer is extremely light weight and makes my skin so soft! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I actually really like the lotion base of this product (made my hands very soft) and the fact that it has an SPF in it. But after I used it, the scent was WAY too strong. I had used it on my hands and I had to eventually wash it off because I kept smelling it. So glad I didn't put it on my face. If this comes in unscented, I would probably buy it.

"Garnier clearly brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer has a nice floral fresh smell to it. first of all the product went well with my skin type, my skin felt smooth throughout the day. it didn't irritate or made my skin dry. it absorbs into the skin so quickly that i could have used it under my make-up without any issues [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I don't use a lot of moisturizers nor face washes on my face simply because I don't have the time and I typically dont face any problems with my skin. However on the sides of my face I do have some bumpy skin and this moisturizer really helped with that. My skin tone looked more even and smooth all around. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had no idea that Garnier even made a lotion so I was pleasantly surprised with this product. It was nice to use a moisturizer that didn't feel so heavy. It made my skin softer and more hydrated without the oily residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"With the onset of the tons of BB, CC and DD creams out there on the market, the fact that I needed to apply this every couple hours or so was a bit of a turn off for me. I just want to set it and forget it! However, the product itself did go on nice and smoothly, didn't feel oily, didn't break me out and it had a nice clean smell.

"I just had cancer removed from my face. My Dr. said its time to bread out the SPF for my body and esspicially my face. I loved that it didnt feel like it was heavy, closed my pores, not greasy. it smelled nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I must be allergic to it because it did the exact opposite of moisturizing my face. It would start getting flaky, almost like I was exfoliating as soon as I started rubbing the product in. Now after using it 3 or 4 times my face is extremely broke out, dry and itchy. I am typically oily, and this is the only new product I have used on my face. The smell was pleasant, and if you don't have sensitive skin it might be great, but I'm pretty disappointed in how it worked for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had high hopes for this sample, but it just did not do what it claims to do. My skin did not look any brighter, and I prefer my Olay products. Perhaps the sample was not bit enough to use it long enough to see results? Not sold. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this moisturizer. I have been trying to find a moisturizer that worked well with my skin for a very long time. This moisturizer smells great and isn't drying or oily. Be very careful when applying the moisturizer around you eyes! I accidentally got a small amount on my eyelid and my eye burned for about 30 minutes afterwards. As soon as my sample runs out, I will be heading to the store to buy a new bottle. I highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the cream and the texture of it. The sunblock is a plus, and the smell doesn't bother me. I wish I had more of the sample to see the brightening effect I think it will work so am willing to purchase a full size and see. If not I will still use as a day cream with SPF [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This PSF 15 sunscreen moistrizer works very well for my dry skin. I have combination dry skin, and the summer season is extremely dry here. It's very happy to try this product out. It can moistrize your skin very well, but it can only last for about 8 to 10 hours long. So you may need to reapply if you work for a very long time in a day.

"I gave this product a shot and wasn't very satisfies. The product and my oily skin did not seem to mix well. I won't try it again, but have no problem telling friwnds and family to give it a try. It may be perfect for them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this! It is light and doesn't leave an oily after effect! It smells fresh without being too string. My sensitive skin loves this product! The SPF works great. I spend a lot of time in the sun and this has done great at sunburn [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I never liked to wear sunscreen because it feels heavy and makes me feel like my skin can't breathe. I'm impressed by the light breathable feel of this product ! I haven't used it long enough to see the lightening effects but even if it doesn't help me with that just the feel and protecting from future darkening is worth it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
THis cream is rich and creamy. It goes on smoothly. I think it would be good to wear on days when you expect some sun exposure since it has a built in sun block. I have not used it long enough to tell much about it and have not seen any instant results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I used this product and it feels so soft. I dont use it on a daily bc i have sensitive skin and i stick to my normal kind that i know wont break me out.

I was glad that this was a generous sample (travel size) instead of a small sachet. So far so good. Product hasn't reacted negatively to my skin and I appreciate the SPF factor. I'm anxious to see if there is a brightening effect to my skin when I'm done with this sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was a good product. I was skeptical about using it at first but it left my skin feeling very soft and clean. It was a little greasy for my liking but once it absorbed it was very smooth and silky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the fact that there is SPF in here but it's not enough. SPF15 is hardly anything. Put at least SPF30 to make it effective to go out in the sun. If I use this at night, then I don't need a SPF at all. This product is kind of half-good. I enjoyed the sample but will not buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
At this price point this is a great product. It didn't have a scent or feel too heavy when applying. The only down side was that I have hyper-sensitive skin and I did break out after the 3rd day of use but very mildly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm usually pretty paranoid about trying face moisturizers, especially ones with SPF cause they tend to be kind of greasy sometimes. However I was pleasantly surprised by how moisturizing yet light weight it was. The one draw back was that I sweat a lot so when I did start sweating and rubbed my forehead, it felt sticky and gross like sunscreen [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am always looking for good sunscreen to put on my face! Sticks I have tried are too thick and pasty, regular sunscreen lotion clogs my pores and make my forehead sweaty and greasy. This product is light, smells good and seems to do the trick against the sun. I just need to remember to re-apply after a few hours as the protection does not last as long as regular sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Two things I always love for in lotion is if it makes my skin feel greasy. This product does not make my face feel greasy which I love. I also have very sensitive skin so if a lotion Burns it is out. This product does not do that. Love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I seen a major difference with my skin almost instantly. This product left my face very smooth and what seemed to even look brigher! this is the perfect summer product! It has spf and thats great for your skin as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a good moisturizer and sunscreen for your face. After a few days I did notice my face a lot smoother and brighter. The only problem is that I get acne very easily so I really need something that's going to treat the acne and moisturize my face but I like this product so I use acne cream under it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So my fiancé asked if he could try the moisturizer because he hasn't been able to find one that goes good with his skin and doesn't smell girly. Well he stole this from me and It doesn't look like I will be getting it back! he said it felt so good on his skin and he works at a rock quarry so he likes to have something with a little bit of spf! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this combination of daily moisturizer and SPF cream!! It's a light and grease free moisturizer that doubles as protection from those harmful UV rays. I also find my skin looking brighter and the light clean scent is a bonus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Had an event to go to recently on one of the warmer days, decided the kiddos needed some sunscreen if they were going to be out for so long. They did their usual complaint of sticky hands, but there were no complaints of the light hurting their skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This seem liked a fine moisturizer, but it got into my eyes and burned like crazy. It got into my eye in the evening, and was still burning the next morning. For that reason, I will not use this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was a nice sample since I wouldn't ordinarily pick up this brand. The moisturizer was nice and light and airy feeling, not oily or heavy at all and seems to do what it claims to a degree. It's no miracle in a bottle, but it brightens slightly and the SPF is always a benefit! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is really amazing. The okay regenerate was really good but for nightly application. This product I put on in the morning and not only does it smell amazing but I fell brighter and happier and beautiful all day long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Clearly brighter is a wonderful moisturizer with spf that leaves no filmy residue. It leaves skin smooth without the oily feel and provides the perfect amount of moisture needed with the intent to protect the skin from harmful sun rays . Try it, you'll love it.

"I was already using a skincare line from Garnier, which I loved, but I think this one is even better suited for my skin type and issues. It gave my skin a dewy glow that wasn't greasy or sticky and it contains sunscreen, which is very important to me when choosing my face products. It also gave my skin a smoother texture and appearance. I purchased this already for when my trial runs out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
By far one of the best moisturizers I've used in a while. Not too heavily scented and applies like a dream. Works well as a base before foundation. Will definitely be purchasing a full sized bottle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"based on the free sample I received, I'd call this a lightweight product all around -- the spf of 15 is light, the moisturization is light, the texture is light, the price is light. so, if you don't need or want much, then this product may be worth trying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not find much use for this product. For myself, I do not see the use of having something that claims to brighten my skin. However, the product was creamy, melted well into my skin and protection from harmful sun rays is a plus. I did not want to use too much since I was not interested in brightening my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was not a very good product in my opinion. It made my skin very sticky and did not sit well. It also made my face sweat and I didn't like that. There wasn't enough product to say if it does what it says so it's not something I would buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"In the winter I tend to use Pond's, but have a hard a time finding lotion for the summer-my skin is VERY dry on my face, but very sensitive and breaks out with most products. So far this product is very nice and feels light-I don't feel it at all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was a great moisturizer with SPF for daily use. Most moisturizers with SPF don't provide enough moisturizing but this one did. I would have preferred it to be a higher SPF but I can always apply additional sunscreen when I know I'll need it and this keeps me protected from the incidental sun exposure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really loved how smooth this moisturizer made my skin feel! I also love that it has SPF. The only thing that I didn't like is how strong the scent is. That won't stop me from purchasing this product, though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use a daily moisturizer every day and found this one to be a bit harsher than what I expect from a daily facial cream. I like the refreshing smell and the initial feel of the lotion, however my face looks visibly irritated within 10 minutes of applying, my cheeks were flushed red and warm to the touch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am currently using my free sample of Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15. It is a nice product that I would probably buy if I didn't need a stronger moisturizer for my dry skin. I especially like that it has a sunscreen included in it, as I am fair-skinned and don't really think/remember to put on sunscreen as often as I should. If I knew of someone looking for this kind of product, I would recommend this brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was quite excited to try this product and was extremely pleased when I saw the size of the sample bottle. I love that they provided enough product for testers to actually try the product over a few days and really see the difference it makes. I was very pleased to see my skin texture improved noticeably. The packaging, smell and price are perfect! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this was a good product that worked well when used consistently. It was smooth feeling to the skin and made me feel fresh when I used it. The moisturizer says what it does and I would recommend it to all of my friends to use again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I try the product but I just didn't care for the Santa and the texture of it and I didn't see that it made a big difference anyway so I will probably not use this product again but it was good just to try it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using Garnier brightening and smoothing moisturizer for five days now and I have seen an improvement in my dark acne scars and the area around them. The marks are lighter and less noticeable and my face is a lot more clear and has fewer dark spots and I am now able look more confident in my pictures.

Initially I was a little septic al because I had tried moisturizers in the past and found them a little greasy but not this one. Highly recommend it. Garnier has done it again with this brilliant moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This item states itself to be both a sunscreen and a moisturizer/skin brightener. I sampled this product, but found it to be only a lightweight sunscreen. I did not feel it had moisturizing abilities. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the creamy texture of this product and the SPF15 protection but could use more protection. The smell is okay but could be better. However, I loved the way this product made my skin feel after using it. It gives that very subtle glow that I look for in face moisturizers and did not make my skin oily, which I loved. I haven't used it long enough to comment on tone improvement but I recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Once I received this sample I started using it instead of my regular face cream before I put on my make up. The results were good, I did not have to use a primer after and it didn't make my face oily like my moisturizer had been. It's also really refreshing and smells good. This is something I can use and also have my fiance use since he works outside. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Great product. I will continue to use but can really see a big difference being that I've only used it for three days. The moisturizing aspect is great though. It also smells really really good and fits great in my handbag for easy access. I will be purchasing this :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wasn't sure what to expect, but this had a nice feel to it and didn't make my skin feel ""heavy"" or greasy. Not enough sample to know if it really brightens but am considering a purchase just to see if it really works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It is a nice consistency and scent for a moisturizer, and I love that it has SPF but I have no need for the brightening aspect of the product nor do I see how it would live up to such a claim. As a moisturizer with SPF I would recommend it though, and would be fine with purchasing it regardless if the price was fair. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am very fair skinned and knowing that this moisturizer has spf 15 makes me feelmuch safer. I am bad about applying sunscreen but I do moisturize my face daily. It felt a little oily but not too bad. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I currently use an Aveeno moisturizer for redness, but I like this moisturizer better. This moisturizer calms my redness and brightens my skin, reducing the spots on my cheeks and making my skin more bright. I will definitely start purchasing this instead!

The cream was not too greasy but it has a very strong perfume smell to it which I did not like mostly because I try not to use anything with perfume in it so as not to mix with other stuff you might put on and some people have allergies. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is such a wonderful product that provides an all around amazing moisturizer combined with an spf 15. It's a win/win combination. The product goes on easily and has a pleasant scent, and it doesn't feel greasy. It's a great product that I look forward to purchasing in the future. I think this is going to be a part of my daily skin care regimen over summer! :) Thank you for the sample, I truly love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was wanting to like this moisturizer a lot because I'm still looking for ""the one"" that I love to use, but the scent is so strong I couldn't stand it. The smell isn't terrible but it is way too strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to try this product, but it didn't work for my skin. Within minutes of applying, my face was irritated and itching. However, my daughter tried it and loved it. The product doesn't feel heavy like some moisturizers and the scent is neutral. I would recommend this product for others, but if you have sensitive skin you should test on a small area first.

"This face lotion made my skin look brighter and more moisturizer right away, but I am not so comfortable using products on my skin that have unhealthy chemicals and prefer to use certified organic instead. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a hard time with getting sunburnt easily, and nothing seems to help, when it comes to sunblocks. This product wasn't any different. Granted it doesn't leave an oily residue, unlike most products. But the scent was so strong it triggered my allergies, causing me to have a sneeze attack. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This worked okay for a moisturizer and I love that it already has sunscreen in it. It didn't take much and left my skin with a healthy glow, and no greasy after feel. However, I wasn't thrilled with the scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It does what it says it does. My face was actually brighter after a weeks use. My complexion seemed smoother and my makeup glided on a bit better. I used a very small about because a little goes a long way. Too much and you will be glistening all the way down the street but if you're into that kinds of thing then go for it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin is very important to me and I am very selective when it comes to skin care products. They have to (and not ) have specific ingredients that suit my oily skin. I like that this product has at least a 15 SPF but to me is not enough. It does moisturises well but I prefer a matte finished that can go well with my current foundation. I passed along the remaining of the sample for a friend to try on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the brand Garnier already. I have bought and used many of their products so it was no surprise that I love this one too. It smells great, not heavy and not messy to use. I could actually tell a difference in my skin as soon as I tried it. I will definitely use this product again. I love knowing that I'm protecting my skin and can wear alone or under makeup too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have only used it a couple of times because of the weather being not so great here. I want to try it in the sun to make a better review. The good thing I have noticed so far is that there is no greasy leftovers like some lotions/sunscreen/moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I generally like Garnier products. I exclusively use their hair products. This is my first foray into skin care products. It was pleasant but not convincing enough to switch from what I currently use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is my new favorite face wash! It left my face feeling so soft, clean, and moisturized! It was sensitive enough to use it to remove my eye makeup but still strong enough to leave my face completely clean! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's always a challenge to find a moisturizer with a sunscreen that is light and does the job. This one definitely goes on light and does not feel greasy or make your skin feel oily at all. I really enjoy and look forward to using this summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
50 Characters... I am a person who does not talk much. This will be challenging. The product smelled good and helped kept my skin moisturized. I try not to go out in the sun in the middle of the day here in South Carolina. It is too hot 90s for mid may and the sun is intense. We really need SPF 55 here.

"I have only used the product for two days in a row so far, but I think that I can already see a noticeable change in the softness of my skin. I will keep using it to see results, but i'm very optimistic! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this product because because it combines a light moisturizer & SPF protection. The only reason I gave it 3.5 stars is if it had a light foundation in the mix so that I could cut down the number of products that I have to put on my face, especially during the work way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this moisturizer. It's so lightweight on my skin but really helps feel hydrated at the same time. It doesn't have that great feel to it that most lotions with SPF have, and it has a very fresh scent. It leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far I like it but I didn't have enough of the product to really make an informed decision on whether it was right for me or not. My skin felt hydrated and I did feel confident to stay outside a lil bit longer than I normally would have (e.g. an extra 10 -20 mins). Once inside, I didn't notice any tanning so that is a good thing. I wasn't able to use it a full week though (maybe it's me because I put too much on). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Many moisturizers that have spf often leave a film on the skin, that feels a little greasy. This does not do that but is light and moisturizing still. It has a very light scent which is really nice and does not clog the pores at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this moisturizer. It has a light citric scent that I found appealing. Although it is a little thin in consistency, it goes on nicely and absorbs quickly. It made my face feel soft and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product smelled good and had a good feel to it. As far as the brightening claims, I didn't notice any difference between this and my regular moisturizer. Not a bad product, just not special to make me purchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product made my eyes water. It seemed to be a little too heavily scented. I think it is a little too thin for me. I was not excited about how it felt on my skin. I will be sticking to my original SPF 15 lotion. I appreciate trying it out before I purchased it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have oily skin which makes it hard to find a good moisturizer, but so far this has been wonderful. The smell is great, and not chemical-y, and it doesn't clog my pores or make my face oily. The fact that it has SPF is a super bonus. I definitely recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this cream. It didn't leave my skin feeling greasy at all and did not make me breakout. I love glow that it lieft on my skin, just subtle enough to look like a natural glow. My skin felt very smooth and hydrated. I would use this on my entire body. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This is a great product.I love that it is a multi-tasking product,providing moisturization and sunscreen at the same time, It was not greasy, absorbing well and leaving no oily residue.

As a moisturizer I was really pleased with this product. My skin felt refreshed all day so I will probably get some more. I also like that it has spf in it. I didn't love the smell. It wasn't bad or anything just not to my taste. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have fairly dry skin in some locations and other areas that have no issue. I normally use another moisturizer and without it I feel like my face will fall off. This moisturizer doesn't work as well as my regular moisturizer so I won't be switching but I will be buying it for my mother whose skin is more even.

I love that the product is lightweight and non greasy and I also love the brand but it smells. The only I can think of is it smells like playdoh. It goes away after awhile but for me it's a turn off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use this as a morning/day moisturizer. I love the citrus scent and that it's got the SPF - that's so important. It absorbs well, moisturizes well and though I haven't used it long enough, I feel, to notice if my skin is brighter, it doesn't break me out and that is also very important. Garnier is really making strides in skin care products. Affordable, good quality, I'm in! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love whenever a product offers an additive health benefits like this one! This moisturizer definitely left my skin feeling softer and supple and also protected my skin with an spf of 15! Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"If you are looking for a pleasant smelling low SPF sunscreen, this is the one for you. It doesn't have the usual sunscreen smell...its lighter and fresher smelling. I don't know if there are other levels of SPF but I would be more likely to purchase a higher level if available, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was skeptical of using this lotion because the SPF lotions I've tried in the past have caused acne breakouts on my face. This lotion wasn't greasy at all; it was light and had a fresh scent. I used it for several days and no breakouts! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product really does brighten up the skin while leaving a nice, soft finish BUT 10-15 minutes after applying I noticed a grimy feeling around my jawline and mid-neck. Maybe I concentrated on those areas and applied too much, I really liked the product otherwise. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the overall product. But I need more spf for my skin. I think it would better suit me if there were a heavier SPF in this cream as I don't wear much makeup on my face so that's all the Spf I'm getting. I prefer a similar product from nutragena that has 30 SPF but it has a heavier feel. I like the feel of this product better [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"First off, this smells heavenly. The oil-free formula cuts down of shine and prevents breakouts. The vitamin C and LHA improve the look of skin. I really like that it has and SPF 15 sun protection. This is not a super moisturizing daily moisturizer but it will be perfect for summer time. This is a great item to keep in your beach bag. I will be buying a full size bottle.

Great smelling and perfect for someone who wants to smell like this all day. Not one to go for the products that stick with me because of allergies. Not great smell for the male in the family though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really only wear moisturizer when I wear makeup and I only really wear makeup when I go to work or have special events that I need to look put together at. So I haven't tried this product out daily but over all I do like the product and have not had any problems with the product thus far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product has a very pleasant and refreshing fragrance. It also has a smooth texture; not watery or too thick. It felt light, not greasy on my face. I feel good about the product, but I don't have enough experience with this particular product to judge if I'd purchase it because I did not have an adequate amount to use for a bit of a longer time to see it's effects on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product has a scent that doesnt go away after applied, it wasnt strong so i didnt mind but i can see people having a problem with it. It did sit on my skin rather then being absorbed compleatly, that may be the suncreen but i wouldnt wear it every day because of that [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It leaves such a light and clean feeling to the skin, without the sensation of heaviness that clogs pores or greasiness. It has a pleasant tingle to it and knowing that it has sunscreen in it, however little, is added peace of mind! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I generally liked the moisturizer but the first time I tried it it seemed to have a bad reaction with my makeup causing it to flake off of my face. After that I put on the moisturizer about an hour before my make up and I didn't have any further problems. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is great because it's a daily Moisturizer that brightens and smoothed my skin. It also has the added benefit of being a broad spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen. I could definitely use it everyday and would love to add it to my beauty regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Most daily moisturizers with spf feel thick and have a funky smell. This is not the case with this moisturizer. With sensitive combination skin I am always afraid that what I use will break me out. I did not have any breakouts with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did really enjoy this product. . I tend to get very oily skin when using facial moisturizer but this actually kept my skin moist without leaving an oily residue.. I love the fact it has SPF because it also protects my skin ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A little heavy for my taste - not a high enough SPF for older skin. I prefer products with at least a 30 SPF rating as I am over 50 and feel that I need the extra protection. I also like a product that is not as heavy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is super lightweight, and works with my normal/dry skin, and I have noticed that my skin looks brighter after several uses and cant wait to see what it looks like after several more uses of using it. I am also very fair skinned and love that this has SPF in it without having that strong ""white cast"" look that SPF usually leaves. So far no break outs and have found that it worked well with my foundation/makeup when applied. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's a lightweight product that absorbs extremely well into skin all while hydrating the skin and leaving no sticky residue or greasy feel to the skin. it also brightened up some dark spots I had from sun exposure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This product does it's job. It keeps my skin smooth and protects it from the sun. I never use lotion because they tend to make my skin feel oily but this product doesn't make me feel oily, just smooth and soft. The sun protection works fine if I'm in the sun for a short while, but I do have really fair skin so it isn't the best for sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

It's an amazing moisturizer and hydrated my skin so much and I love that after using it everyday my skin doesn't get oily and it's just soothing and relaxing. I didn't see much results in the brightening aspects of it but I've only used it a couple times but I absolutely love this product and am definitely going to purchase it!

The moisturizer is nice and it is a plus that it has spf 15. Now and days people need to be careful with the uv rays from the sun. I know I have to with my family history. It is great to have a product that helps your skin feel good and be protected. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"The moisturizer felt nice. However, the sample did not contain enough product to really make a decision or see any noticeable difference; such as brighter skin. Plus the SPF is only 15, much lower than my current moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the lightweight texture and how easy it is to apply but the scent is too strong and definitely won't do for those with sensitive skin. I do like the citrus scent though just wish it's lighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer works great. I use it everyday and I never notice I am wearing anything. It isn't heavy or greasy and leaves my skin looking amazing. I have noticed my skin looking better as I continue to use the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Moisturizes my face without it feeling greasy. Love this product. I have never used moisturizers until this one and I have started using oil of Olay foundation. Both have made my face less dry and supple. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The product was a bit itchy and I like the current moisturizer that I use better. I may still recommend it to others because the smell and texture were great. Others may have a different experience since skin can vary from person to person. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is a definite time saver. You get the benefits of a moisturizer along with SPF 15 and the added benefit of a skin brightening product all in one. The product sinks into your skin-no white residue, and leaves your skin looking healthy and glowing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"There's nothing ""bad"" per se, about this lotion, but it just didn't do anything for me. It claims to be brightening but in the week that I used it, I didn't see a noticeable difference so maybe you need to use it longer. The texture was ok, but SPF ingredients always add a little extra weight to the feel once it's on your face. Scent was light to not noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Good sunscreen ingredients. Contains chemical rather than mineral sunscreen. This moisturizer goes on light with a gentle, pleasant scent. It has good coverage with only a little bit. can say that it's one of the only moisturizers with SPF that makes the skin on my face soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been looking for a nice light lotion with SPF in it and this product hit the mark! It goes on smooth, not greasy and offered great basic day to day SPF protection. The smell was light and fresh as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the fact that my skin was not oily when I used this product, however, It was not for me because It has something in it that did not agree with my skin and I ended up with a rash on my face. I would have love to use this product. Have been looking for a product that would not leave my face shining and with a sun screen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like that it did not leave my face feeling greasy, and at the same time it has a slight SPF to help protect while I am out in the sun. I do wish it came slightly tinted to help even out skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This works effectively for my daughter, but is something I cannot use due to it irritating my skin which makes it unlikely that we'll purchase this product because it's pointless to buy several different types of sunscreen products for us. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was easily the best product in my box this time! I love that is acts as a moisturizer and sunscreen. I don't know that this is the intent of the product but I also feel that it works well as a makeup primer. I just wish they offered this product in a higher level SPF to combat the harsh summer rays. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the best facial sunscreen I've tried yet! Most of them are either tinted or really greasy or just straight up feel like it's clogging the heck out of my pores. This is a nice and light cream that makes me feel good, makes my skin look good and gives great protection. would definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The smell is a little bit of a turnoff, but it doesn't stick around once it is applied. I did notice that if you use too much of the product, it peels on your face like peeling dead skin. Not very pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this product because it leaves my skin moisturized the way I neI have dry skin. And I like that it has an SPF in it because it saves me the time of having to add additional sunscreen to my routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF-15 works wonderfully. I loved the soft supple feel it left my face with. I also used it on my neck and chest to help with my lines due to age and sun. I notice an improved appearance in my face. I totally recommend it and I have already recommended it to others. The added SPF-15 is a nice bonus!! Thank you for the awesome product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I rated this product a neutral medium score across the board..not because it isn't a good product or a bad product, but simply because there's not enough of a sample to use long enough to verify if this products claims are true. As for using long enough to find out what it DOES and CAN do...there are lots & lots of other similar products out there that do the exact same things to clean & freshly moisturize skin...so this is not worth it's price point for what it actually is and does. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed this moisturizer. I have extremely oily skin and I found that with this product I didn't get a crazy oily face at the end of the day. The only thing I would say is I wish it was a higher spf. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have just atarted using my free sample so I don't have much to review yet. I can say that I like the feel of the moisturizer on my skin. Having sensative skin I often worry about an allergic reaction, this product presented no problem for me. I am watching the mirror to see if I notice an obvious brightening of my skin. Good moisturizer and sunblock that right there is a bang up combo. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am always cautious with moisturizers because I hav56e oily skin. This did make my skin feel extra oily with in a few hours but thats pretty typical with most products. I did like it though and its quality [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the fact that it is oil free and didn't leave my face looking oily or greasy. My only issue with the product was the strong smell that seemed to linger for a while. I am pregnant and more sensitive to smells than normal, so it was off putting to me. Otherwise, I enjoyed the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have sensitive, combination skin that leans toward oily and breaks out easily. I've used this 4 days in a row as a morning moisturizer and my skin loves it. It leaves a nice matte finish, and makeup goes on super smooth after. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the silky feel and scent of this cream. I like washing my face and then applying this. It is so easy to apply and is not greasy. I love the way I feel like this is all natural. It works well and helped clear some of my acne. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This sunscreen worked well, even after being in and on the water all day. It was a sunny day, and this came through for me and my family. Wish it was a bit more natural and marine safe, but a decent product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the texture and feel of the moisturizer and loved that it had SPF. I wasn't too crazy about the scent of it, which is why the rating isn't 100% positive. Overall though, I liked how it made my skin look and feel. I'll keep my eye on this one to see if they change the way it smells. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I would prefer a higher spf, this product went on nicely, my skin looked smooth and even, and my makeup went on over it perfectly. It doesn't have that horrid odor that so many products with sunscreen do, so that's a big plus. If I didn't live in sunny Southern California I would definitely purchase this product. However being that I'm out in the sun daily, I need a stronger spf. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this product. I usually do not use moisturizers that have sunscreen in them but when I went out to mow the other day I decided to try this. I was actually surprised. It made my face feel so much smoother and I really liked the scent. After I got done mowing I noticed that my face was not as red and sore so the sunscreen really worked. I would definitely recommend this as a daily moisturizer that also keeps you from getting sunburn! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This lotion leaves your skin feeling soft and ultra moisturized. It smells great and doesn't leave any oily residue. It also has SPF which is a bonus, I just wish it was a little higher level of protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used some Garnier products in the past and they are not my first choice. I was intrigued by this product and found that it feels sort of oily on my skin. It does a great job! My face did feel soft, and the product has the scent of sunscreen, which I didn't mind. Over all the product was good, just not great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My face is very dry and most products I've tried work for a while before I need to move onto another. While I don't feel the sample was big enough to really try for a few days, I don't believe this product would work for someone with severely dry skin such as mine. I would recommend this to those with normal skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using this product on my face once a day for two days I began to get breakouts all over my face which I never have had happened. I usually only get a pimple here and there but since this was the only new product I had used I know it was from this and once I stopped using the product the breakouts disappeared. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product was a product that I neutrally liked. Although it did make my face soft at times it did not brighten my face. Overall I did like this product and would use it in the future because I like SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very pleased with this free sample I received. My children's skin is very pale. i used this on them while outside in the pool for about an hour. When we were finished, they had a nice tan, but were not red at all. And their skin wasn't all dried out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this sample and immediately tried it. I like the smell it has a nice subtle scent that isn't overpowering. It feels light when applied. I like that it has spf which is very important to me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This daily moisturizer with added sunscreen is a very good product. It goes on nicely, absorbs completely and is not greasy. Left face soft , smooth, very moisturized and my skin did seem to be a bit brighter. I'm always on the lookout for new face products and I really like that this one has vitamin c and lha. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the idea that a product can both moisturize and protect from the sun. I have tried a bunch of those before and they leave the skin way too sticky. I like this one as it does not do that. My only problem with it is that the SPF level is way too low. With a higher SPF, it would be perfect! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I wish I had a whole bottle of this cuz its hard to judge the effects of the product based off of such a small sample. I did however like that it was multipurpose and had a lil bit of sun protection in it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My experience with clearly Brighter Brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer SPF 15 was very good it stopped my face from burning in the sun while mowing the grass I'm very prone to burning and need SPF and this being such a low SPF really surprised me how much it helps my face not burn and also got rid of a lot of different freckles that I had whitening them and making my face a lot brighter so that I know longer have to use a lot of different types of make up.

I love how this product helped with my dullness of my skin. I am getting older and I hate how dull my facial skin was looking. I have been using this for about a month now and notice that my skin tone seems brighter and that makes me happy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely hate it when lotions or moisturizers are oily and deal heavy one the face. That's the main reason that I DO NOT put on any lotion on my face causing it to be dry. I've been searching for a good moisturizer and I'm glad I got this sample because now I found the perfect match. It also drys very quickly, I'm assuming that it's a water based lotion, which I LOVE!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the product. I keep forgetting to use a sunscreen on my hands and face, but I wanted to try one with a moisturizer and this gave me a chance to try one. I really liked it and the smell wasn't too perfumey for a man. Will have to use for awhile and see if it moisturizes over a period of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the Garnier Clearly bright ing and smoothing daily moisturizer with spf 15 free for me to try from Pinch me in exchange for my review and my honest opinion. . my opinions are my own! I absolutely love this moisturizer! Finally one that spf in it but doesn't feel heavy or greasy or feel or smell like spf.. It just blends into my skin it's very light and smells good and my skin is so soft after using it.. I love that it is easy to wear under makeup [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's a good face moisturizer, but I think it made my face a little oily. The face moisturizer I use now doesn't have Sun protection though and this product is the best I've found with Sun protection so I'll probably buy it for my outside days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Good smell and feel. Very light and not greasy. Wasn't enough to have a glow in a week but it was nice to try Would definately try it out again in a full size when I see wit on sale. It truly was a nice moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like this face lotion - I have acne so am sometimes weary of moisturizers, but this is light and didn't cause any issues. I think I will need to use it longer to get more of a brightening effect, but I like that it has SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have very sensitive skin so I have to be careful with what I use. I do like to sample many things though to find what works good for me without breaking out my skin. Is moisturizer worked good for my skin it did not break me out and it helps with my extremely dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this moisturizer. It keeps my skin hydrated for awhile without having to reapply. i can put some on after I take a shower at night and when I wake up my skin will not be dried out. I also like the consistency, it's not too thick like other brands. Plus it also has sunscreen in it which is great! I will definitely be buying this in the future.

"It glides on very smoothly and leaves a very pleasant citrus / floral scent! It absorbs fairly quick and is very lightweight, so it can be applied before makeup if need be! I have very dry skin and this moisturizer does an amazing job at keeping my face hydrated without leaving and greasy oily feeling and has not caused any irritation or breakouts!

I put this on under my makeup. I did have a few issues with breakouts though. I have very sensitive skin. I'm not sure yet if I would buy this but it kept me from burning and gave me all day SPF protection while I used it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The moisturizer has a nice scent and is very silky when applied. I have only just tried it so I am waiting to see if it has the brightening effect. But it is smooth and very silky on my skin. I love it so far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got about a weeks worth of used from this product sample. It was an ok formula that was smooth on the face, not too oily, and didn't have a scent at all. But there was nothing spectacular about it. If you're looking for a no fuss, low SPF moisturizer this is the one for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm don't usually use moisturizer on my face. I can't stand feeling like I have a greasy mask on my face. I however enjoyed using this product. It smells good and doesn't feel like I have anything on my face. My skin felt softer and will surely use this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I actually really like this product. It leaves my skin feeling soft and not greasy and it is a good moisturizer. I am normally very sensitive to strrong ingredients but this one must be gentle because my skin didn't react at all. I think I will make this my go to moisturizer. It isn't that expensive either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although I really did not notice a difference when it came to brighten my skin, it did make it feel smoother and I do like that it has SPF of 15 in it. Maybe I just need to use it longer to see any difference when it comes to brighten my skin. Will more than likely be buying this item in the future.

Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer with SPF15 was nice. It was easy to apply. It was creamy & the application was easy with no problems with irritation or any stickiness or residue on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this moisturizer because it has SPF and it actually moisturizes. I hate when you put something on and it feels oily or you need to use 2 or 3 different products to get the same result as this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like Clearly Brighter. Its gentle on my sensitive skin so it doesnt break me out and leaves my skin very soft and smooth. It doesnt male my skin as bright as I had hoped but its great in every other way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This moisturizer has changed my daily habits for the better of my skin and my overall face and look. My skin was really dry before this and I never used a moisturizereally until I tried one from the dollar store and this one. This one blew me away. The smell the feeling it gave my skin the dryness it repaired. It's made my skin feeling healthy and as soft as a baby bottom [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is thicker than most, so make-up does not go over it very smoothly. Also, I cannot detect any additional ""brightening"" or ""smoothing"" from it. Worst, it seeps into my eyes from my cheeks and forehead and burns my eyes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Garnier skin active clearly brighter almost has a soap smell tome maybe it's the sunscreen in it I do not now... But it dosent feel heavy on my face so if I wanted a lotion just for my face it would be fine and the spf is a pluss but I am not totally sold on it it will depend on the cost. I am just not a person to put a lot on my face all the time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"based on the scent and the feel, this product seemed more like a sunscreen than a moisturizer. that being said, it didn't hurt my face like some sunscreens do since i have sensitive skin, so that's a plus. good for everyday when you don't want to put on a thick sunscreen [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used a few of these type of products but they usually sting my sensitive skin but this didn't sting my skin at all . It absorbed well and didn't make my make up look greasy or icky . It has a nice scent and isn't over bearing so that is a plus . I really didn't notice any whiting effect but I liked it over all . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is more of a sunscreen then a moisturizer. To me the scent was kind of too strong to put on my face. I don't usually have any problems with being allergic to fragrances, but to me this was just a tad bit strong for me. The cream did go on nice and smooth and was absorbed into the skin rather easily. So, if scents don't bother you then I would recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So far I have not seen any change in the skin's completion. I didn't get any allergic reaction either so that's a positive. But I think it is gentle enough that it will not make a significant difference! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"A must have!! I have oily skin so wearing moisturizing has always been a chalange, but this product has solve that issue. Not only I don't get the extra oily shiny skin after applying it, also made my skin smoother, brighter and healthier looking. I will continue using it as part of my daily rutine.

I love that this product is so lightweight! You can put it on in the morning before you leave the house and just forget that you have it on. It also has a wonderful smell!

"I have tons of different lotions, moisturizers, and skin care products. I use them temporarily because I am told that I need to use them to have flawless skin. I don't wear makeup, and can count on my fingers the number of zits that I have every had. Most of these products are not for my skin. If it is dry, then I put on some neutral moisturizer, if i'm going outside, I put on some sunblock. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer did a great job at moisturizing but an excellent job at brightening and evening out my skin tone. I was very impressed that I didn't even need to use it more then a couple of times before seeing visible results. Loved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had been using a different brand of moisturizer with spf inside but i liked this a whole lot better. i havent been able to find it in a store near me yet. it must be new or just not carried around me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this because of the built in sun screen. It doesn't make you feel too oily and doesn't have a super strong scent. It didn't break me out or cause any rash. That's a very good thing since I have such sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have combination skin so it's hard to find something that either don't dry out some places or get other places too oily. So far this seems to work at the right pace for my skin. It's not really rich in feel though but not bad overall. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this for my face and neck.. Im starting to notice small bumps on my face. I have really sensitive skin and its not working for me. Very sad! I had high hopes for this face lotion. Maybe its just too thick of a formula for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really did not see that much difference in this and other that i have been using that cost less. The sun protection is readily available in other products that cost less. The choosing is in the fragrance I think, between products. I would not like to pay more for something that a less costly product does a good job at. I did not see an improvement in my smoothness or brightness after using this, then I would see in other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do tend to prefer cleaner, greener products; but I thought this product was very simple to use. It can be added into any skincare routine, I didn't find it irritating or bothersome; it was a pleasant experience. It provides some great benefits with the adding of some SPF which I always use, so it's extremely convenient. I wouldn't purchase it myself, but I would completely recommend it to people; I just like very simple ingredients. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It is hard to tell if a product such as this one is good or bad in a few days of trying it. It seemed okay though, it did not make my face feel greasy, so that is a plus. It did seem to help moisture my face. As far as SPF control, I cannot rate it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What struck me most about the sample was how smooth it was on my skin -- it went on just as moisturizer should. I like that it has sunscreen, as I need all the help I can get with that -- I am very fair and unfortunately, I often forget about sunscreen. A moisturizer with it built in is exactly what I need. The sample size was great, too. Thanks for sending larger samples for products like this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of Garnier Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer a couple weeks ago. It is a very good product, however, it only has SPF15 sunscreen. People who are fair skinned would need a lot higher SPF to get proper coverage from the suns rays. The product does have a pleasant scent. It does soak up into the skin and leaves a smooth non greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

My daughter really liked this product. She said it works great ! It is much better than the moisturizer she was using plus she gets the SPF protection.

"This is a good moisturizer for the summer months. It is lightweight and non-greasy, and it absorbs quickly, making it great for putting on under makeup. I was skeptical about this product, because I had tried the Garnier Nutritioniste Anti-Sun Damage moisturizer in the past and found it to be too harsh for my normally dry, sensitive skin. This, however, turned out to be a good moisturizer which offered me a little bit of sun protection to boot. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This is an OK product -- but I need more moisture and a stronger SPF because I live at 6500+ft above sea level (aka close to the sun) and we run anywhere from single digit humidity to low 30's. I just need more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved how soft and hydrated my skin felt after using. It also gave my skin a slightly more even tone. The best part is it also has spf so my skin also gets protected from any more damage or unevenness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I tried this sample recently. It went on nicely. It wasn't too greasy or overly perfumed. A nice light scent. I can't say that it ""brightened"" my face. I don't know how it would do that actually. It is a nice product, however. Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer left my skin feeling great! Due to the SPF in it, I opted to use this in the morning before applying makeup. My skin felt quite covered that day and I wasn't the biggest fan of that. This moisturizer under my foundation was just too much for me. I plan to try it again and give the moisturizer more time to soak into my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have sensitive skin and I have to be careful as to what I use on my body due to allergies from different products.

The scent of this product is a little too strong for me to use on my face. But since I have been noticing a lot of age spots coming on the back of my hands...I have been using it there. It makes my hands really soft and I am hoping over the use of the sample will help to reduce the sun spots from coming. I wish I had always used sunblock over the course of my life.

"I've tried Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer before this sampling, and I have to say, it's a perfect product. It is light, so it is good for everyday use, it protects my skin, and it smells great (no heavy fragrance). I would recommend this to anyone looking for the right SPF moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the Clearly Brighter Skin Active by Garnier, I like the way it feels on my skin, I love the sent, I love the fact it is oil free, I have only used it for a few days, but I can al ready tell a difference in my skin ,it's so much smoother and brighter , it puts moisturizer back into my skin, and there is no greasy feel to my skin at all!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It's a light cream that absorbs quickly with no greasy or heavy feel. It has a really pretty scent and after using it for several days my skin is softer and looks healthier. I also love that it contains sunscreen to protect my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product! I try to use a moisturizer with SPF in it under my makeup daily. I especially liked that this is in a tube. No jars to dip my finger into and get lotion all under my nails, LOL! I am currently using this in my RV and find it great for travel. Will definitely pruchase this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I immediately noticed how light this product is to wear during the day, especially under makeup. It contains an SPF and does not irritate my skin at all. It did not feel heavy, and it kept my skin hydrated all day. I have extremely sensitive skin, and I will definitely purchase and recommend this product to those who suffer from breakouts or constant irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer works great. It's easy to take along with you anywhere you go. Not messy when applying on skin. It also helps brighten your skin so it will be two different tones. I recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It really depends on the price of this product. I already use a daily moisturizer that has a higher SPF than this. If the price is right and there is a version with a higher SPF, then I might consider switching to this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall, I was pleased with my free sample of Garnier's Brightening Moisturizer. However, there was nothing particularly unique about the product compared to other daily moisturizers. For me, the biggest con is the low SPF (15) but the greatest pro is the delightful scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I prefer a lightweight moisturizer. This one has what I like. It has a great feeling on my skin. It has a pleasing smell that sets it apart from other products to me. I like my skin with using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am enjoying this new moisturizer. It is creamy but doesn't cause me to break out. It has a light and refreshing citrus scent which I am loving. I would say this is better than all the face lotions I've tried....it certainly helped brighten up my skin within a few days [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"A nice moisturizer (non greasy and absorbs ok), but with very low spf. Would prefer it to either have a higher spf (at least 30) or none at all, so another product, like a concealer or a cc cream with spf could be used on top. Would recommend only if spf is not an issue to the person. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have very sensitive skin that burns very easily. I used this product before my son's baseball game. The smell was very nice. It felt nice on my skin. Not greasy or sticky. Prevented my sensitive skin from burning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this face lotion daily now for 2 weeks, I am very pleased with the look and feel of my face since using. I was surprised that there was a scent to the lotion but am thrilled that it does not cause any reaction like I thought it would. Definitely will purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Normally I use Garnier Moisture Rescue, because I like that it absorbs quickly into the skin. Now that I've tried the Clearly brighter moisturizer, I like it a lot better. It absorbs into the skin quickly too, but also leaves my face a lot brighter! I also like that it has SPF in it. I will be purchasing this soon! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have a photoallergy where I require natural sunscreen either zinc or titanium dioxide. This has chemical sunscreen or chemical absorbers in it. When I go out in the sun for 30 mins or more I develop itchy hives and redness that lasts for three days. When Garnier comes out with one containing zine or titanium dioxide I will be over it because I do love the brand and the scent of this product. For now my mother gets to enjoy the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed this product! It is oil free, so there was no residue left on my face after it was absorbed, and it didn't cause me to break out. It also smelled AMAZING! Great moisturizer to use daily, I would definitely recommend this to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product literally smells, feels, and has a texture like sunscreen. However, it was very moisturizing. Pros: Moisturizing Light(ish) Good on sensitive skin Doesn't break me out Cons: Feels sticky Terrible fragrance Very runny $$ Overall statement: If it's an extremely sunny day, and you feel you need lightweight protection, this is perfect. However, on normal days when it's cloudy and there's not much sun, avoid this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have sensitive skin so it is hard to find products that don't cause a reaction. Garnier has done it again with this light weight moisturizer. Goes on light and has a fresh scent. I used it in addition to my BB cream and had no issues. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Normally I have really easily burned skin. After two hours I'm scorched. I went out to visit the neighborhood rummage sales, of course, forgetting my normal sunscreen. When I got back I was surprised to see that I wasn't burned half as badly as I should have been. I remembered replacing my morning Vitamin C application with this and boy am I happy I did! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have always disliked the feel and smell of sunscreen, but with this product it not only smells amazing, but I don't get that nasty greasy feel of a normal sunscreen. When trying out this product I noticed that my skin was not only getting protection from the harsh rays from the sun but also was getting much softer and I never had to worry about struggling to turn a door knob because it soaked into my skin very quickly. Can't wait to see the long term effects... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer left my skin so soft and smooth, but the intital texture feels pretty awful when you first apply it. The closest word I can think to describe it is slimy. It absorbs quickly but I can definitely see the texture getting to some people. It's also fairly heavily fragranced, though the scent is pleasant. Overall I really like this but I definitely don't think it will work for everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved how the moisturizer felt, it was a really nice consistency and was not thick or goopy like some moisturizers with spf tend to be. It did brighten my complexion overall . I felt that my skin overall became more even toned and softer also. This is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
One of the first thing I noticed was that Clearly brighter has this great lather. Second thing was it smelt great. My skin felt so smooth and my skin was so perky and refreshed. I think I've found a great go to that doesn't break the bank and works amazingly! Thank you for letting me test this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not big on sunblocks or suncreens due to the bad experiences with popular brands. However, after trying this product, I'm beginning to think it's not so bad. This is weightless, does not smell like the chemicals in suncreens, and actually makes my skin feel softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am super picky with moisturizers - my face is a mix of normal and oily. Most products like this are fine for the normal parts, but the rest of my face breaks out. This stuff seems to agree with my skin. No breakouts, no super oily feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was amazed by this product! I have extremely sensitive skin, extremely dry and I am prone to getting eczema outbreaks on my face. The medicated cream leaves your face very oily and causes break outs so I've been looking for a regular moisturizer that can help with my problems, and this product has been incredible! My face is actually soft to the touch, which I can't remember the last time that was true. 10/10 would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Sunscreen is a thick white lotion. It has a strong smell that I do not like but it is bearable and fades somewhat into a perfume smell over time. It spreads on easily, evenly and completely and seems to penetrate into the skin well. After applying the lotion, my hands were not left greasy like with some sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am extremely pleased with this product. It leaves your skin looking and feeling great. I normally do not like any spf products because they're so heavy on my skin, but this was nice and light and just felt great! I will definitely be purchasing this when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I cannot yet see the brightening effect but this is a wonderful moisturizer with the perfect SPF for dark skin. It is light and non greasy. After I exfoliate/cleanse and tone my skin I applied to moisturize before applying my makeup and it worked so well. I'm very satisfied with the moisturizing aspect of the product but would love to continue to use to see if it truly brightens. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I imagine this product would work well for a majority of people but it doesn't work for me. I have extremely dry skin so I have to use intense moisturizers or else my face will flake and crack. Unfortunately there wasn't enough moisture for me to use this product repeatedly to really determine its over all quality. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am very sensitive to smells and this moisturizer has a very strong scent. I got a headache as soon as I put it on and had to immediately wash it off. Also, I burn very easily and SPF 15 would not protect me from getting a sunburn. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I plan to use my sample bottle on my face to avoid sunburn!! It smells like a fruity perfume. It doesn't smell like typical sunscreen which is nice and leaves skin silky smooth. At first I didn't know what it was for I thought it was a face wash. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wanna thank Garnier for such a great product released on a market!!! I've been looking for such moisturizing cream for years! Every cream I used in the past was giving oily effect... But this one is completely DIFFERENT! Like like like!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have combination type skin that's prone to blackheads so I can't use face cream, I need face lotion that's moisturizing and not watery feeling. This made my skin feel so soft and kept it moisturized for the whole day. I also like that it has spf and doesn't smell weird like my other face lotions with spf, it has a very nice smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"For one i love the smell its so pretty,and i love the way it feels its not greasy,and dont just sit on ur hands or feet where ever you put it.Second my hands and feet feel so soft after 3 days of using it no more cracked feet or hands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I felt the benefits of this moisturizer and definitely appreciated it but it felt a little heavy for spring/summer, for me. I need something breathable and lightweight so this would be ideal for a fall and winter moisturizer for myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This facial moisturizer works great for me. I like that it isn't oily. A lot of moisturizers make my face feel greasy, but this one does not. It feels light on my skin and has a nice scent. This is a moisturizer I would buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like Garnier brand but for some reason I've never tried any of their moisturizer before so I was excited to use this after I received the sample. After a few days I broke out so I stopped using it right away. Quite disappointed because I really wanted to like it as it's very moisturizing however, my sensitive skin just didn't like the ingredients I guess. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I definitely did like this moisturizer a LOT, it made my skin super soft and it smells great, it didn't irritate my skin and it has sunscreen! I would definitely purchase once I finish what I'm already using [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recommend this to all my friends! I am using it daily and I have noticed such a difference in the softness of my skin. I am going through menopause so I have quite a bit of dryness that this took care of. Thank you for letting me try this wonderful product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked this moisturiser and I'm excited to know that it protects my skin from the sun all while brightening my skin. It feels lightweight and it's easy to apply under makeup. I also like the texture and how it feels on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the feel of the moisturizer. I also like the way it spreads so easily and you do not need alot for full coverage. It has a light scent. I like the way my skin feels,however I do not think I have used it long enough to say whether it has made a big difference compared to othr products I have used. I will continue to use the product until it is gone and take it from there. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I first opened it, I thought it smelled like bug repellant. I guess it has a citrus scent. A little of this goes a long way. I just used a small bit and I feel covered. It's not greasy. I like it. I think it's a keeper. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started this product a week ago and I am satisfied with how well my skin reacted with it. I applied it after i washed my face in the morning and was satisfied with how smooth my skin felt and not oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is the first moisterizer with spf that I have ever liked! It applied very smoothly and did not smell anything like sunscreen. It had a nice floral scent that reminded me of the scent Chanel products have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've already noticed a difference in the way my skin looks in the short time I've used this product. My husband has noticed too and he likes it. I love the fact that as it's brightening and smoothing the skin on my face, it is also protecting my face from harmful UV rays. It's on my list to purchase the next time I go to the store. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using the Clearly Brighter moisturizer I noticed an overall healthy glowto my skin. I used this on my face since I tend to have severe blotchy dry spots which make my makeup look as though it's peeling. After use, I applied my makeup and noticed a huge difference in the texture of my skin. I will be purchasing this product in the near future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This a wonderful moisturizer! My skin is on the dry side so I'm always looking for the right moisturizer. This brightened up my skin with a natural looking glow and kept my skin hydrated throughout the day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this lotion just about every day weather before I go to bed or when I wake up before make up application and it really does go on smoothly and dries quickly and leaves a good base on my skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a good moisturizer. But it gave me a couple pimples. Though I do have oily/acne prone skin. But they popped up on my nose when I usually don't get any there. The SPF count is a bit low for my liking also. This moisturizer didn't leave my skin oily or greasy looking. I like the added benefit of Vitamin C. It also smells nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used to use a nutragena product for my face mosturisort but not any more! I love the way this product makes my skin feel and it has a great small to it. The only negative thing I could think to say would be having options with a higher spf [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The product seems to be good. Nice scent but i think that the sample size just wasn't enough for me to get the full benefits. Unfortunately i have gotten some severely dry skin over the winter months & a.c. in need of something stronger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I never knew I had a need or use for this product. The sample was just enough to intrigue me. Like the spf bonus ingredients, even if the number was lower than I expected. But then again I doubt I would buy for sunscreen alone. I don't usually buy or use moisturiser, but when I tried the sample, liked the results. I think it even made me realise I should try to take better care of my skin wether I am indoors or outdoors. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was not that impressed with this moisterizer. I have an extremely dry t-bone and this product did not really alleviate that dryness. It just did not seem to moisterizer my dry skin enough for my satisfaction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Although this is a great product, the the SPF sunscreen in it, it makes it super greasy on skin that is already oily (on my face). If someone could develop moisturizer with sunscreen that doesn't make my face greasy, they would be miracle workers!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked how easily this product applied and sunk into skin. I love that it contains SPF to protect my face, even in the winter. The sample size did not provide enough time to judge the brightening and smoothing aspect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a very nice moisturizer but not for me. It is light and sinks right into the skin, and the fragrance is not too overpowering. My skin does better with products that have no smells and more simple ingredients, and I feel that this garnier moisturizer may have caused me to break out a little. For other skin types, maybe more mature skin, I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Clearly Brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer is an adequate moisturizing product, but it did not stand out in terms of quality or results. I only used the sample amount, so perhaps longer use would have yielded more dramatic results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I live in the desert and this moisturizer is great as the weather gets drier. It also didn't make my cystic acne flare up which is always a nice plus. Smelled great too! I have already told my sister she needs to try this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm buying a full-size version of this as soon as I use this up. I love everything about this. A little goes a long way. It's very moisturizing, it doesn't irritate my skin or clog my pores, and it smells really good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I spend a lot of time in the sun, so SPF 15 doesn't do me any good. If it was SPF of 30 + I would probably like it more. My skin is pretty youthful and bright anyway, so I didn't notice a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this moisturizer. It felt very hydrating, and my skin felt smooth after using it. I also like that the product has an spf; therefore, I don't have to use a separate one. I may buy this product once I've finished the moisturizer I'm currently using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This lotion to me is just like other lotions except I find it to be unique to have sunscreen in it also. It don't have a large amount of sunscreen but a little bit will be good, This means you can moisten your screen and protect it from the sun at the same time.

"Great product for spring and summer, a lil heavy feeling but for such a high SPF, I'll be buying for me and the family for daily use at the pool!! Will be using on neck and chest daily as soon as I buy it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a bit surprised that I like this product as much as I do. I think it smells nice, goes on smoothly, and most importantly doesn't make my foundation slide off throughout the day. My only thing is that, while it's a great moisturizer and sunscreen, I don't find that I need a daily sunscreen, as I generally spend most of my days inside. If you're the kind of person who is outside a lot this is probably a great choice for you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
the clearly brighter brigtening and smoothing moisturizer with SPF 15 seemed to worj just fine--although i'm not totally concinced that it brightened or smoothed my sking very much. but i do think it works well as a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the packaging & the cream is okay. I just wish I didn't have to reapply it as often as I do compared to the other mosturizers I use. I also don't like that a little while later if you sort of rub the spots you applied lotion on it seems to rub off as if you're dirty/sweaty even if you just showered before using any.

"I really wanted to like this product as I use a moisturizer with SPF daily! Once I tried it, I noticed a strong and somewhat overwhelming scent. I don't normally mind scented products, but this one was somewhat overwhelming and I felt like it lingered on my skin all day. Glad I got to try it, but I won't be buying this product.

"There wasn't a problem with this product, but I'm not in the habit of putting stuff on my face every day (I don't wear makeup, usually), so it was a little difficult to remember to use it regularly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I found the product to be an okay moisturizer. I have oily skin and therefore do not use much skin cream except for on my arms and hands. I would say this is an okay product that goes on okay and I feel is absorbed well into the skin. I would not say I am wowed by the product but I did not except anything out of the ordinary from the product either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer was nothing any one of a 1000 moisturizers isn't. Does it moisturize? Yes. Did my skin look brighter, clearer or in any way better than it usually does. No. This product's one selling point is that sunscreen is built in. It's just okay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The product feels nice and not sticky or oily when applied. Only used the product on the hands and seems to last with several hand washings during the day. Hands remained moisturized for most of the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this lotion. it has spf 15 as well as vitamins and antioxidants. It feels good to know your feeding your skin good products. The lotion absorbed easily and I felt my skin has been looking brighter. The fragrance of this lotion was a little strong, hats the only con. Other than that, loved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I honestly don't know if it brightened my skin at all. I did feel like the lotion was not moisturizing enough for my skin. I live in a dry climate and after applying it my skin still felt dry and a bit tight. I need a heavier moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I thought it was very watered down and not very thick. I normally use Aveeno products so I guess I was expecting a little thicker moisturizer. It also bothered my eyes quite a bit when I got it near my them. I looked as if I had been on a crying jag because my eyes wouldn't stop watering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am always in the market for a good moisturizer and occassionally I like to switch it up on my normal/dry skin. This was an awesome sample and the scent is very neutral which I loved.

"I loved this moisturizer! I have used the same moisturizer for 15 years; having combination skin makes it so that when I try other products I'm always disappointed. This moisturizer did not disappoint and I'm considering switching. The product was not oily, was not super thick; it went on easily and did in fact brighten certain areas if my face. I wore it throughout the day and didn't experience any feeling that it was suddenly gone or that it was dripping on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I think the Clearer brighter brightening product is nice. It feels great on my face. I think it jas a little too much fragrance. A little perfumy for me. The product I am currently using has a SPF of 30. I am outside all the time so I feel I need a little stronger product to use as a daily SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Maybe my set back to this product is due to the fact that I have eczema all over my face, therefore I use intensive care moisturizers. I thought it smelled nice and it applied nicely too. It did not moisterize, and it didn't brighten. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I personally am not the person to use brighteners or moisturizer because i have oily skin. However, this product seemed to work fair enough. The only down fall was that for some odd reason my skin became really dry and had to put some on constantly to moisturize my skin and avoid it from cracking. Other than that, if you wear it daily it does the job your looking for. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Due to the crazy cold weather here, I have only had a chance to try this product once, but I was pleased with the results. It has a light, non greasy feel to it, and has a nice scent. Seemed to work well at blocking the sun rays. I am looking forward to trying it again now that the weather is better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have not had an opportunity to use this product for a length of time. The few days I did use it, I really did not see a difference in my skin tone. But the SPF is a plus!

"I tried this product on my morning walks with my doggie. We walk for close to an hour and definitely sweat. During the walk when I began to sweat, the product ran down into my eyes and burned a little. I had to keep wiping my eyes. My current sunscreen doesn't do this so I am going to stick with Coola.

It had a light clean smell and didn't feel at all sticky or slimy after I put it on and proceeded to sit in the sun watching a softball game. It worked really well to keep me from getting sunburned too which is a definite plus in my book! I really liked it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When I went to put the lotion on my face it felt really good not oily like most with an SPF in them but a few minuites later my face started to itch and get really splotchy come to find out there is something in it that I'm allergic to but I let my friend use some and she said that she really liked it I wish I had a positive experience with it but at least my friend did [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I've never found a moisturizer with such a great scent before. My only problems with the product were that it seemed to be marketed as a moisturizer, though the active ingredients were all sunscreens, and that when I washed my face at the end of the day, I could feel that the product had not totally absorbed into my skin and was washing off.

"While this may work as an SPF 15 sunscreen, this isn't really much of a moisturizer. My skin is so fair, SPF 15 is nowhere near enough to protect me.

This is a nice lotion and the best part is that it rubs completely into the skin! It doesn't leave that weird greasy feeling behind. When I finish my other lotions I am very likely to go and purchase this item. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I'm always on the look out for a great face moisturizer and this one was a plus since it has SPF 15 which most people know by now that it helps protect your face from the sun, therefore decreasing the wrinkles.

"It is an alright moisturizer. It is definitely NOT for going out, so I don't know what the spf would do good for. I hated the texture. I love garnier as a brand, but this was very disappointing. I hate when moisturizer balls up. I distribute the product on my face and within seconds I get rolled up nastiness on my face. Sure, it has good ingredients, but I think there are better moisturizers without this texture offering the same skin benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really wanted to like the Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf 15. The lotion/cream was smooth and absorbed easily without a sticky or oily finish. Unfortunately, as with most Garnier products, the scent was overwhelming and did not scrub off easily. If this were offered as unscented, I would definitely recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Due to health conditions I had a reaction to a product through no fault of the product. After my system settles I will throughly try this. So far the scent doesn't seem to bother me, but using it will tell. This is why I love samples because I never know how things will go until I use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It feels light on my skin, and moisturizes quite well. But the best part (for me) is the fact that my skin doesn't look oily shortly after using it! With most other moisturizers, my skin would look quite oily not long after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product! After applying a thin coat, which is all I needed, it really did make my skin seem brighter and moisturized! I was really happy with the amount I needed to use which would make the product last a lot longer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Garnier simply makes good products. Some are great, this is good. Feels nice and light and I love anything with SPF! 15 isn't high enough for where I live but I'll take it. Didn't irritate my skin at all. I'll buy this for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have really enjoyed this sample. The scent is very pleasant, kind of like a tropical smell. It absorbs into the skin very quickly with no sticky or greasy residue. After a week I have already noticed my complexion looking a lot more brighter and clearer. I really like the fact that it has SPF in it too. I will certainly be buying this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the product when I tried it . It was cool and refreshing with no greasy feeling . I also liked that it had a spf of 15 .I liked the moisturizing effect it seemed to have on my skin. I definitely would need to use it longer to get a better idea and the long term effect on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Befire I had children I would always take such great care of nyself, now I am lucky if I remember to put lotion on at all. I love that this gives great moisture plus the added bonus of a little sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Super loving this sample of Clearly Brighter sunscreen. I've been using it daily as part of my skincare routine and it's been awesome. The sunscreen is light enough to use daily and has made my skin so soft. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It was light and not greasy, which is important for those who have oily skin like me. My only complaint is that I felt like it wasn't hydrating enough to last all day on my dry skin. After applying a thicker layer I noticed that my face felt softer and smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It was a good product. Not sure about the sun protection ,as I was tanned even after wearing it, but the moisturising part was good. I doesnt leave an oily residue and I think is suitable for oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I was outside all day for a school event, I used the Garnier Skin Active Sunscreen. It worked all day and when I made it home I didn't have a sunburn.

"It's hard to find a moisturizer on the market that does its job as well as not leaving your face greasy. Going out in the sun is not an opinion in Florida, but this helps keep your skin safe and moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product seems to work all right for its intended purpose, but I am extremely pale and if a product is going to include SPF it needs to be higher than 15 for me. Might be fine for other people I know and will tell them about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When applied to the skin it did not leave a greasy feel nor did it have a sticky film. The fragrance was very pleasant. Did not test the product to see how well the SPF worked - I am very fair so I don't stay in the sun for any length of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i like the way it smells and feels on my skin it doesn't leave any oil feeling on your skin smell fresh and it help protected from the sun at all times which is very good for a person that is out and about like me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I needed a moisturizer to use after my cleanser for my face. This stuff is moisturizing, but it also has SPF in it, that helps my skin stay somewhat protected. It's also ok to use prior to applying makeup. I definitely intend to buy the full size of this product. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am in love with the consistency of this moisturizer, especially since it has SPF in it. It is so light on your skin, is not greasy what so ever for a SPF and sinks into your skin like nothing else I have ever tried. I don't know how well the brightening part works, but it does leave your skin feeling so smooth and soft. I do plan on purchasing Garnier's other NEW day time basic moisturizer to see if it is as lovely a consistency as this one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I font typically use sunscreen even though I should Mainly because I dislike the way most feel in my skin, but this moisturizing sunscreen left my skin feeling soft and smooth as opposed to heavy and oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It had a nice scent and wasn't greasy like some other moisturizers that contain sunscreen, but after two applications I began breaking out. I stopped for a few days and switched back to my regular moisturizer and my skin settled down. Then I tried it again and the breakouts returned. I gave what was left of my sample to my roommate.

"The samples that i recieved in my pinch me box where very nice. I have not tried the allegra yet, but the Garnier whole blends shampoo and conditioner I love.

"My skin burns very easily. But, I love going outside and enjoying nature and feeling the sun on my skin. This kept me from burning for the most part. But, like every sunscreen you have to apply it again after a while. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i loved it.M,I'LL DEFINITELY BE PURCHASING IT!y skin is oily and acne prone so i react to most products but not this one,it's moisturising but not oily and protects my skin from enviromental hazards with no side effects and reaction [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a nice moisturizer! I constantly was my hands at work and it doesn't leave my hands feeling greasy after applying it. I like that about it. I like the neutral scent and that it has some SPF too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It was a little runny/thin, but not in a majorly problematic way. It had a nice cooling sensation to it, in my opinion. However, my big issue was the smell. It wasn't terrible, it just wasn't pleasant either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried this and Olay illuminating moisturizer and I feel like this is the cheaper less effective version of that. It does work but take twice as long as Olay to see results. Definatley a substitute if u cant afford the Olay price. Just be patient with results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved the CLEARLY BRIGHTER BRIGHTENING & SMOOTHING DAILY MOISTURIZER SPF 15. IT gave me the extra sun protection needed, and my skin felt some much better.it was not dry or flaky.This product is a miracle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this sample on a recent trip somewhere sunny. It felt refreshingly lightweight and absorbed easily. I don't think it did much in terms of oil control, but I did feel moisturized while using it. My only wish is that it had a higher SPF, otherwise a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this product immediately after receiving the sample. My skin felt more soft and was very radiant. I had spent most of my day outside in the sun and I did not get sunburned which was a plus. I went out and bought the product for myself and I recommended it to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Ok so I am in love with this lotion and the fact that it has built in sunscreen makes it even nicer. I had a chance to use it at the lake this last weekend and it allowed me to enjoy my time without having to worry about really burning. I did notice however that i needed to reapply after i got out of the water but it went on nice and didnt leave me feeling sticky or greasy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked the way it felt on my skin but the lingering smell of sunscreen was annoying. Overall I would not purchase it but if that was a quality people did not care about it would be a great product for them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love that it states that it helps even out skin tone. The only problem I have with it is, it is way to oily looking and greasy looking after I apply it. Once I apply my makeup over it,I am way to oily looking and it's the moisturizer for sure. I will continue to use it as it is more than enough for it to work on my skin. I will consider purchasing it to go along with my daily regimen. I apply it before going out in the sun. I also love the smell. I give it 4 stars for being GOOD! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a regiment of a high end line of moisturizers, so I'm always skeptical of ones you can buy off the shelf. This one was okay, though. Not as heavy as some I've tried. Left my skin a little more dewy than I like, but all in all, not bad for the price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was so surprised at the size of my recent samples. My tube of the new Clear bright daily moisterizer was enough for about 2 weeks. I was so satisfied with my results i bought a full size bottle on my next grocery run. Now i apply it after my shower every morning and my skin just looks healthy not flaky and porey as it did.

"I was provided a free sample of this product. I have used it when I went out running in the afternoon. It smells really nice, it isn't irritating and doesn't feeling like you have sunscreen on. I haven't had problems with the sun, although I'm wearing a visor and only run for 30 minutes. It's also light and doesn't feel greasy at all. I like it and would buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like Garnier products in general so I was excited to try this one. I have uneven skin tone and some dark spots, so I could benefit fro ma product like this. Usually lightening creams take a long time to take effect or show visible results. So on that end,I would need to use it long term to really see results. But as far as the smoothing and brightening promises go, it does deliver. I saw results after the 4th day. It does smooth, especially the neck area. I was impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just started using this in the mornings after I wash my face. I like the way my face feels and I even went a day without any make-up. It is still early, but my complexion seems more even. I will keep using to see how it is in a few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I didn't exactly have high expectations for this drug store brand moisturizer as i have oily skin and nothing affordable has ever worked out for me. However, I was in fact, pleasantly surprised. This oil free product really hydrates quite nicely without leaving the skin oily. I'll surely be making a purchase in the near future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Not greasy, nice size sample! Got to use for mutiple days in a row and my skin feels good, no acne or reaction and I'm seriously going to buy. Now if they'd make an unscented and tinted version...I'd be set!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the scent of this cream and i love the way that it made my face feel. I like being able to use one cream and it work for making my face soft and protecting it from the sun without having my face and pores feel overwhelmed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have not noticed that my face is any brighter than before using this product. It does, however, work well as a spf containing product. I would recommend this product as it does not make my face feel oily or that there is a thick spf product on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product had an awful smell. To me, it smelled of bug spray. Also, about a day or so after using it I got some spots/acne on my head. I NEVER have acne and this was the only item I changed in my routine so I have to assume it is due to this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I tried the clearly brighter brightening and smoothen ing daily moisturizer spf 15. I felt like it really did make my skin seem brighter and I like that it has a little spf. It has a nice texture that wasn't to heavy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was happy to receive this sample, as I frequently have dry skin, especially on my face. I was very disappointed with the ""oil-free"" claim, as this product seemed to make my skin extremely oily!

"This is by far the best sample I have tried ...to date. I love this moisturizer...love it. I have sensitive skin and most moisturizers break me out., not this one. It glides on smooth and light, is absorbed easily. Never feels heavy or oily. I have been putting it on right after washing and not bothering with make-up it feels so light and my skin is glowing afterwards. Lovely product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this product because of the texture. It is so smooth that it glides on your face so easily. I like that there is not a strong scent and a little goes a long way. I would definitely tell others about this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have oily skin and I keep hearing that I should be using a daily moisturizer. I am in my 50's and I want to take better care of my skin. I like that it has the SPF included in the product. I applied the sample and it absorbed easily and quickly into my skin. It didn't feel ""heavy"" or anything, it felt nice. However, after about 45 minutes, my skin was getting oily. Maybe it's just not good for oily skin. I think for someone who has dry skin it would do a fine job,. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have very sensative skin when it comes to being in the sun to much and to top it off i also have very oily skin. So a lot of the sunsvreens out there are oily and that doesnt help me a lot. But after teying this product for a couple of days now i can say that i love it. My fave is protected from the sun and it is not oily at all which is a big plus for me. I will definitely buy this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This sunscreen is so lightweight. I applied it right after cleanser and it felt good. I have sensitive skin and usually sunscreens makes me feel uncomfortable.

"I love this product so much I am definitely going to purchase soon when my sample runs out. Doesn't leave a whitecast on skin, doesn't feel sticky or take too long to sink into skin.

This was a fine moisturizer and it does have a little bit of sun block in it but not enough to be used only as a sun block. I liked it but I felt it wasn't something I'd use all the time. If I was going to be in the sun very long I'd want a higher spf and if I wasn't going to be in the sun I wouldn't probably bother using it unless I felt like my skin was very dry. I imagine this would be prefect for people in cold dry climates for winter use when it is sunny and cold all the time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I really like the scent of this product. It absorbs well and is not greasy feeling at all. I think it will be a great summer moisturizer as it seems a little too lightweight for some dry patches I still have on my face right now. I prefer to apply my heavier, winter moisturizer for those areas. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tend to have troublesome skin at times. Half of my face may be oily and the other half dry and flaky - it is hard for me to find a product that I love. While I do appreciate the spf in this product, I just wasn't satisfied with how it made my skin feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really didn't see anything special about this product. It was a little thicker than what I would use as facial moisturizer but yet didn't seem as substantial as what I would normally choose as a body moisturizer. There was nothing about this that would make me switch from the products I am currently using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this 3 days in a row while I was going to be working outside. It is still spring and the sun is not strong. I dod not notice any brightning effects but I was glad it spf. In the summer spf 15 would not be enough for me. I was happy until it started stinging my eyes about halfway through each day. It is not water resistant so if you sweat forget it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This moisturizer smells like citrus and I love it but I'm not typically one to put fragrance on my face so I had to take down a star for that. Otherwise, I really enjoy this moisturizer.

"Once again, Garnier has made another superb product! Their products line my bathroom counter. After a few days of using this, I noticed a brightening of my face! I glowed.

"For someone who doesn't pay attention to these kinds of things, the product seemed to work well. I used it a couple of times and it had a great smell, somewhat of a oatmeal and sunscreen scent.

"I just added this to my box because duh, it's free. But after recieving and trying this product I think I may purchase it!

"I haven't finished the bottle yet, but I can already see a visible difference in my skin tone. My complexion doesn't look dull and blotchy. I look brighter and more even.

I like this daily moisturizer very much. It feels great on my skin plus it has sunscreen protection in it too. My face feels very smooth and moisturized after using this and I like my skin does look brighter and better (at least I've been told that my face really looks good now).

I am very skeptical when it comes to face stuff. (I have very sensitive skin and everything either breaks me out or makes me peel.) This product was great. Not to heavy or greasy. I used it twice a day: in the morning after my shower and before I go to bed. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked how this sunscreen was light enough and good enough smelling to use as a daily sunscreen/moisturizer. I felt like it wouldn't make my face break out from being too greasy. The only thing that could be better is that it's only spf 15. I can only wear this for occasional moments outside- anything longer and I would burn. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the cream on my face and did not feel oily which the cream says it's oil-free. I also found a scent in the moisturizer which was not too strong and smelled good. It has a good consistency and perfect for summer coming up [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is absolutely amazing it works very well on dark spots and acne marks. If you are a brown skinned woman and deal with hyperpigmentation this is the product for you it works wonders on evening out you skin tone, and getting rid of blemishes highly recommended.

"I love Garnier Clearly Brighter and it's great for my skin. I loved the creamy consistency and soft texture. It felt light on my skin and definitely made my skin brighter and more vibrant looking. The scent was also pleasant and did not irritate me. I use this a lot throughout the day on my face, neck and hands. I loved it. I did get to try this free but these are my own opinions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The scent of this product was amazing, it didn't have the normal sunscreen scent. The texture was smooth, and creamy which I enjoyed. However I began to experience an allergic reaction and could not enjoy the product as I should have been able to. I would recommend this to anyone it makes for a great sunscreen that's not heavy or greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay moisturizer with an SPF factor is very important to me as a senior citizen. My skin is normally dry and I have to use moisturizers on a daily basis and if it has an SPF factor it is double important to me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have a very bad combination, I am a cross stitcher with very dry hands due to frequent washing. I have been searching for a moisturizer that does not leave a greasy feel behind or any kind of film that could transfer off onto fabric or floss and this product fits the bill to a T. And the SPF is an added bonus so that I do not have to worry about another product to protect from UV damage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer works really well and makes my skin feel soft. I put it on in the morning after I wash my face with warm/hot water. I like that it has a low spf to it so it will protect my skin from the sun a bit, but allow me to get some sun so I don't look too pale. No reactions to it at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I didn't see a definite result and i also was unable to experience the SPF part since it was a small sample size and it had been cloudy and raining when i used the product. On the other hand i did not experience a negative reaction to the product either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My husband has dry skin but also works in the sun as an officer. He has been using this to keep from burning but also hydrate his dry skin on his cheeks and chin. After using this a few times he already noticed a difference, and it was clear he was not longer getting sunburnt at work either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this lotion because it absorbs fairly quickly and doesn't leave my hands feeling greasy at all. The low SPF is just a bonus, obviously I wouldn't use it as standalone sunscreen, but it's nice to have a little SPF all the time, especially for folks with sensitive pale skin like myself.

"I have very sensitive skin, so much so I can't wear any make up without repercussion. I did try this on my face & so far I haven't had any issues! Its still early for me to tell but if all goes well this would be the first product I could actually not worry about using! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm so impressed with this product! Although I haven't used the whole sample bottle, so far the results have been amazing. I have acne pron skin and everything that I've previously tried has broke me out or left me very irritated and itchy. This however didn't! It left my skin so smooth and healthy looking. I would highly recommend this product to anybody looking for something like this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Clearly brighter moisturizer is a great product. I used it and was satisfied with the lotion. It is non greasy feeling and protects against the sun. I put some on before my husband and I worked in the yard and my face didnt get sunburned. Will be using it this summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I didn't personally have any serious qualms with this product, however I really didn't notice much difference with it as compared to the moisturizer I already use. I will continue use of the product I already have on hand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first, the smell sort of out me off. Not because it's bad, because it smells delicious, but because I don't usually like putting scented products onto my slightly sensitive skin. But I tried it and man was I wrong! Works great, keeps my face feeling moisturized all day long, love that it has an spf in there, and looks beautiful under makeup. Really love this product, it'll definitely be my go-to moisturizer this summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the smell of this sunscreen also my kid loves this...My kid doesnt like the other sunscreen because of its strong odor but he loves this sunscreen..Also its not that greasy and feels really good on the skin..I will surely buy this product again...

I have very oily skin and I washed my face and put this on when I was headed out side and it worked great all my friend got a bad sunburn on there face and I only had a tiny hint of pink as it started to wear off but it worked great and didn't make me breakout which was a plus [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This has easily become my new favorite moisturizer. I have combination, sensitive skin with an oily t-zone and dry flakey skin on my chin and cheeks, that is prone to breakouts. Since using this I have not had a breakout which was a miracle and have noticed that I am having less skin peel and flake off of my dry spots. Even my boyfriend mentioned that my skin looks healthier. This is the moisturizer I have been searching for. Love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After applying Clearly Brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf 15 my skin felt softer and had a radiant, more toned look to it. I also noticed an improvement in the dryness of my skin and after showering my skin still had a nice glow to it. It's a great moisturizer that doesn't feel heavy on my skin, and it doesn't leave it feeling greasy either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although it says brightening and moisturizing, this product does neither. It doesn't brighten at all. The skin doesn't feel supple and moisturizer as it does when I use other products. The ingredients are also full of harsh chemicals. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter, It has a light scent, not heavy at all. Applies smooth on wet or dry skin. It's oil -free which last 8Hrs. It will be my go 2 Daily face / neck moisturizer ( could use all over). This product would be great for a woman or a man. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall, it was a decent product. I don't think it was outstanding in any way and the market is glutted with so many of these products you really need to have a better quality, or different packaging. I would suggest something in the packaging that's more eye catching. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Smells and feels wonderful but just wonder what size container does it comes in besides the size for the same . reading the back it says to reapply every 4 hours. that would be hard to carry around to reapply if the container is bigger [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This came at the perfect time. I was in the middle of trying to find a new facial moisturizer I had recently brought a new one and it was making my face dry. This product OMG AMAZING!!! I love that it has SPF in it and keeps my face moisturized all day. I am using the sample everyday and will be buying this for sure!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed the way this product made my face feel. I did not have oily skin afterwards and it left my skin soft to the touch. I also felt like I was doing my skin good by protecting it with sun skin. I would likely buy this in the near future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was cautious it would make my skin feel slimy or smell bad but it didn't. Also didn't make my skin break out which is great. I used it alone n it was great to put under makeup. I applied it over another mousterizer that was more wet and it mixed perfectly with it. I love how I can use it with everything and on its own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was able to try the product but unfortunately washed it off after just a few minutes. When applying the lotion I experienced an unpleasant smell but thought it would fade after application. However, this was not the case and I removed the lotion - or as much of it as possible - soon after. I would not recommend this to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am interested in a moisturizer with sunscreen however I am sensitive and cannot use scented body products. Also I prefer products that are all natural or as natural as possible. Otherwise I did try on my hands and it did apply easily but one hand started itching. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The scent was nice and as well as the feel of the product. It wasn't too thick which is a problem with most products that contain SPF. I haven't had a chance to do an ingredients check but so far I really have liked it. I did not break out or have issues with product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have always had an issue with my hands being dry and I feel like I am constantly looking for some kind of lotion to fix that problem and this is my new solution. When I first put it on I used too much so it ended up being slimy but after I figured out the correct amount to use, it was all good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the smell of this product! It has a light clean scent ... Barely noticeable but enough to make it appealing to use on the face. It almost smells like Olay. The texture is creamy and super absorbent when applied to to the face. I went as far as mixing my foundation with this product and it blended very well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not a huge fan of sunscreen because of the feeling it leaves on my skin, but of course I need to use it so that I do not burn. I live in Florida and it is always hot. Yesterday I went canoeing and I used this moisturizer, it worked excellently. I did not burn and I felt protected but also like I was getting some color to my skin too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer isn't horrible. Initially it left my skin a tad greasy feeling, but that only lasted a few minutes. It smells great, which is a bonus. BUT the scent gave me a headache. If you are not sensitive to perfumes, I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using my sample daily, and am impressed with how long is it lasting because of the very small amount of product needed to see results. Decent SPF for daily use and my skin is truly cleared and brighter, with a healthy glow that I normally only have when pregnant! Will totally be buying this when my sample runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for the past 3 days and I am already in love with it! This lotion has not broken out my skin and does not leave a sticky or greasy residue. I will definitely be buying this product soon! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this product. Most of the daily moisturizers I have use leave my face feeling greasy but not this one! I did notice that my skin was more radiant and smoother! I have semi-sensitive skin and I didn't break out and my skin didn't get irritated. Love this would recommend it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My foot year old has been experiencing burning during hot days. This SPF had helped her tremendously!! She can apply herself and it is long lasting. Through the play of a for year old it's amazing! Definitely will recommend to friends... It keeps my little fair lady from burning! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The moisturizer was easily absorbable. Gave a nice glow and finish to the skin. The SPF amount could have been higher for more sun protection. Fragrance was similar like other garnier moisturizers, not too strong. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the same moisturizer for a few years but halfway through the day my skin would become extremely oily. After trying this one I am hooked! It left my skin feeling moisturized but not overly oily or sticky. Great for all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So I got the sample size in my box this month. I really never use things like this soo gave it to my daughter. So far she says it's made her skin softer she seems to like it. Going to buy her a bigger bottle to see if it Brightens her skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer will moisturize even the dryest skin--I know because I have super dry rough skin and this made me face smooth and velvety. My makeup went on so smooth. I will be purchasing this again!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great product does well for a moisturizer but I have extremely oily skin and felt like a greasy film on my face. Says 'oil free' but not so much for me. I tend to use moisturizing GELS. I gave this to my niece she loves it she has oily/combo skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used it on my face while the sun was shining. .....it was close to 85 degrees that day. .the product protected my face. ..was not greasy. ..and did not break me out. ...yes I will buy some of this when my sample runs out! !thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The clearly brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer is such a great product. Once I applied it to my skin it felt a lot smoother and fresh. I also has a really nice scent. I would totally recommend this to family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product has a smell that I find refreshing and clean. The lotion goes on smooth and is oil-free which is a must for me because I have both oily skin and patches of dry eczema. My skin is soft and feels moisturized. Also, the SPF 15 is a plus although if I planned on staying for long periods in the sun I would use a product specifically for blocking rays. 2 thumbs up!!

This stuff smells amazing! Its perfect because its light weight and absorbs instantly into your skin. It doesn't leave that greasy feeling or color your face at all (since it has a bit of sunscreen). It has SPF 15 which is a plus because the sun here in Texas is really something to take serious. Loved it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this product! Perhaps even more so because I went in with low expectations. However, after several uses following a normal wake up and wash, I'm deeply impressed. This product provides protection, moisture and a lovely sheen. I will definitely be purchasing this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was a little nervous using this thinking it will dry out my face even though it is a moisturizer but this went on and stayed on fresh. It's to soon to tell whether it's helping but it sure feels nice when I I apply it before heading outside. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I don't tend to like putting sunscreen on cause of the scent it has and the feel it leaves on my body. But this particular product has a pleasant scent and doesn't have that weird after residue on the my fingers which I really appreciate. The other thing about other sunscreen products is after hours of coverage and exposure to the sun it tends to peel and become nasty this one held up pretty well after my first use and look forward to future use [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"A great sample, generous size will last a long time. This moisturising sun screen had a nice subtle scent, was a nice smooth texture and not thick, it went on nicely and felt comfortable on my skin. I was confident using this as a moisturiser/sunscreen all in one, everyday. Thank you for introducing me to this PinchMe! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This product is AMAZING it protected my skin from the sun perfectly! It is way better than other sunscreen I have tried before .

"I have tanned face and this worked beautifully to give me a lighter, brighter color and the plus is it has SPF too. I apply it after every six hours as here it too dry and hot making my skin loose all its moisture. Happy to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer left my skin feeling hydrated, soft and looking healthy. I have combination/oily skin that is more on the oily side and this product melted into my skin and didn't leave me feeling greasy. I also loved the size of this sample it was big enough to really be able to get a good opinon on the product. I have already purchased a full size in store.

"I currently have a cold, so as you can imagine my nose is pretty dry. After applying this moisturizer under my makeup, there was no more dry nose! I will definitely be buying this as soon as I run out of the sample. It also smells heavenly! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Perhaps I am biased because of the smell, but after awhile the smell made me nauseous and I could not continue after a few days. I heard good reviews and I agree this moisturizer definitely keeps your face moist and the flakes on my face has disappeared but I developed redness. I think it's just because my face skin is super sensitive. I would still offer this as a choice to my friends since I am the only one with acne and sensitive skin so I think it would work well on theirs. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'd definitely recommend this for girls who need a lightweight summer moisturizer and have normal to oily skin. For my dry skin, this just wasn't moisturizing enough to do the trick, but it went on smooth and didn't cause any irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It was nice to have a moisturizer go on quick and easy without any kind of oily feel. I don't know if I would say this product was the best of the best, but it is a very reliable product that does what it is supposed to do-which is actually saying a lot since there are many products that don't. I didn't give it 5 stars only because I wasn't wowed, but to be honest I don't know what else it could have done to earn that 5th star. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This daily moisturizer is not heavy like some creams or too watery where you feel wet. Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF 15 is just the right amount of thickness to a moisturizer that will absorb easily and keeps you feeling soft throughout the day.

"I like that it combines a moisturizer and SPF so you only have to use one product instead of two. It was easy to apply and left my face feeling soft and smooth. However, since i have such fair skin, 15 SPF is not enough to protect me from the sun so I was not able to get as much use out of this as I would have liked.

I am loving this moisturizer. It does give life to my face and my foundation goes on smooth over the top. I love it has spf in it for some protection. I have packed this in my travel bag and plan to buy the full size for home [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"In the past I've been using separate moisturizers, sunscreen, and BB cream products, but this product is something that almost combines the three. It brightens my complexion while keeping the sun' harmful ray away, as well as keeping my skin moisturized. I wish the moisturizing effect was stronger and lasts longer though. It is a little bit greasy, but most sunscreen products are. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product was pretty good! It didn't leave my face greasy, and worked well with my other daily rutine, which is coconut oil. It would be awesome if you made this product with some coconut oil in it. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
One of the things i look in sunscreen is the protection amount and how it feels on my skin. The Spf was a bit low for my taste but it did help me when i went outside. This sunscreen felt very fresh on my skin and didn't smell weird or bat at all so that's a plus. All in all i would recommend this product for people who just want a bit of protection.

"I love how this made my skin feel soft not greasy and to me it really seemed to make my skin brighter. My skin tone definitely saw an improvement. Have tried different moisturizers recently and this one, with 3 days of using, has really impressed me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The formula is very lightweight and feels good on my face. It has a pleasant smell that lingers for a while afterwards. I wish it was just a bit more moisturizing but it did leave most of my face feeling soft and I do love the spf, the smell, and the overall feel when you're applying it. It didn't make my makeup feel cakey at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i was skeptical about using this because most of the facial moisturizers ive used are greasy but this one is not at all! it makes my skin soft and absorbs pretty fast. i love it and use it every day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Any moisturizer that has sunscreen in it tends to break me out. I think it's because it's usually a thicker formula/lotion and clogs up my pores. I was hoping that this wouldn't be the case with this Garnier product. I really love the scent though! Hopefully it will work for others but I will need to stick with a non-sunscreen moisturizer.

"I used my sample on a fairly sunny day, and it did give good protection. If it had been more time spent outside, or a much sunnier dsy, then I would've needed a higher spf. But it was great for a 15! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the way this product smells! It has a fresh, clean scent. I thought it felt a little greasy when I first put it on, but as soon as it's absorbed, that feeling is completely gone. It had absolutely no residual stickiness like some other moisturizers I have tried. Plus it didn't make me break out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

While I already use a daily moisturizer with spf I wanted to try this one to see if I should switch. While I like the smell of this and the consistency is the same as the one I'm currently using. The scent on my face is too much. I don't mind scented lotions or shampoo but I guess I don't like it on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I like the product so far but because I just started using it I'm not sure if it will end up causing me acne or not, like many others do.

"The first time I used your product It wasn't that I wasn't satisfied with it, I just have very oily skin and found it not helpful. It felt as if I was caking on more. I then gave it more thought and figured it would work better right after a shower. I proceeded to follow out my theory but yet still ended with the same result. I don't think it is your product, I think it is just my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"While the SPF is low and for bright summer days, I will definitely need something a little higher, I really liked this lotion. To keep your skin looking young it's really important wear sunblock all your long and this is great for the rest of the year. My face felt soft without looking greasy. In fact it actually had more of a matter find affect on my skin which I really really liked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product smelled good and went on smoothly, but it stung a little and didn't give me any enhancing benefits where as other products I use of this type give immediate positive results. I didn't see it work. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have only used one kind of garnier product. I have not yet used lotion but this product is great. I use a lot of lotion because I get dry skin. This lotion doesn't leave your skin feeling pily. I will definitely purchase in the future [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved this product. I do believe that my skin is softer and if I didn't know better it is a little more tighter. Which I enjoy. My skin was starting to shrivel up a little. I gave it some love by using the lotion and I loved it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use a different moisturizer, and I'm not sure how I feel about this one over my other. I like that it has the sun protection component to it, but with my fair skin I still need additional protection, even if I'm not spending prolonged amounts of time in the sun. Overall, I like this cream but I don't know that its a favorite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I currently use another product (can't think of the name write at this review time) but I know my body, and I know that I have stuck with the one I use for a long time, I used to use E45, but my body sort of got immune to it and I started getting dry skin again. So I changed to the product I'm with. I used this test sample and noticed just below my glasses line was getting dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for the past week and it is great. I have combination skin, but this does not make me oily. The only downside is it has a slight sunscreen smell but nothing I can't get past. It doesn't clog my pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall, I think this is a good product for other people. Not a good product for me. Even though it says it is oil-free, it feels oiler and heavier than other products that I normally use for my face. I actually started breaking out a bit since using it, and I normally have very clear skin. Other than that, I haven't noticed much of a difference in my skin tone/texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved how soft and even toned my face looked after using this. I plan to buy this because it is the first moisturizer that does what it says it will and that is important. I am going to be 60 in July and most people guess me at about 45 and want to keep looking younger. This product evened out my skin tone and took years off my face. I am thrilled with it since I do not like to wear foundation and now I really don't have to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I did like how it went on and a little went a long way but however I really did not like the smell and do to sensitive skin I did turn red and my cheeks had a sting to them. But don't let me turn you off cause my mom used it and she loved it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product, it's a daily moisturizer and also sunblock. It feels very smooth on the skin when it is being applied. The formula is nice and thin and it doesn't feel heavy on the face. The only downfall is that it is sunscreen so my eyes did burn a bit when I put it on. But other than that it's a great moisturizer/sunscreen [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have naturally oily skin so it can be difficult to find a moisturizer that does not make me look as though I just ran a marathon. As soon as I put this on I felt like my face looked brighter and it really did add that extra moisture that I needed. I will absolutely be purchasing this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall I was pretty satisfied with this product and would recommend it to anyone with normal or dry skin, however I have combination skin and it made me break out with acne and even after washing it off, my face remained oily for a few days. More hydrating than I expected. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is a great product to use when only being exposed for a short time due to the low SPF. I would definitely recommend it to friends and family though. Very light feeling when you are wearing it and not greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer absorbed quickly into my skin. It didn't leave a greasy residue behind, like some other moisturizers do. I also mixed it in with my liquid foundation, to make my skin look dewy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very skeptical to try this product because of the brightening ingredients. I have freckles and do not need them to be brighten. However, after trying the product I noticed that my skin felt smooth and My freckles were not impacted. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this product it is very light and is not greasy. I have sensitive skin and this product did not affect that. I love the way it made my skin feel. I would really recommend this product to my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very impressed with clearly brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer spf15. It is a light enough formula to do the job, but not so heavy that it's greasy. This product is just right!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I believe it would be nice to have a little bit more of a smell to it, it seemed to not have much of a scent. Other than that it kept my skin feeling smooth and soft and I did not have any breakouts while using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing SPF 15 Daily Moisturizer from PinchMe as a free sample. I am using it and like the fact that it is non greasy feeling and absorbs quickly into the skin. I can use this daily to protect my skin from the sun's rays. Recommend this product to everyone. We all need protection from the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The moisturizer was lightweight and felt very good on my skin. I felt that it moisturized my skin very well. I can't comment on the brightening and smoothing effects of the moisturizer as I have only used it for a couple of days, but all in all, I liked the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the new clearly brighter product. I like having a moisturizer with sunscreen in it but does not change the consistency of the product. I like that it will even out my skintone and leave a healthy glow on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have extremely oily skin and often have issues with moisturizers leaving a greasy/oily residue on my skin but not with this product! I am pleasantly surprised on how great this makes my skin feel. It is soft and smooth without having a tacky feeling. I love that it has SPF too! I plan to repurchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
From the moment I opened the tube I was in love with the fresh scent. It goes on creamy but not heavy. Very light and smooths in nicely on your skin without greasiness or being shiny. Will definitely make this my new moisuritzer/sunscreen! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I but it on after taking another lotion off my face and it instantly felt, smelled, and looked better on my skin. I have very sensitive skin and this did not bother it at all. I recommend this for everyone who just wants a normal lotion that actually feels nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It has a great scent, but the only part missing in making this product amazing is the spf. The spf is 15, I wish it covered a broader range though. Applies perfectly, smooth, oil-free, and mainly does the job. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't super impressed by the product. It is a lift moisturizer and has SPF 15 and it worked for a Garnier product, but it leaves a gross greasey film on your face and it soaks up in my skin too quickly so it doesn't keep it very moisturized, I feel. It mostly just feels like a sunscreen, which I will use for one since it doesn't clog pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love that this product has sunscreen in it. This moisturizer made my skin feel soft without being greasy looking. It was fast absorbing, which is great. Skin felt smoother after using this product and gave my skin a glow to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It made my skin feel plump and moisturized as soon as I put it on! The smell is ok not off putting or anything and the packaging is very nice also. Happy that it has spf 15. I would buy this and recommend it to friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This had a good scent and went on well, wasn't greasy... it irritated my eyes a tad but I also don't like to use anything less than spf 30 on my face. If it had a higher spf I would have been more willing to keep using/purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product it made my skin glow so much! I applied it on before my foundation and I looked amazing, I got a lot of complements on how nice my skin looks after using it in my Dailey routine!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this for a couple days , but I cannot use it because the scent bothers me a lot. It is very strong for something that you put on your face & not pleasant. I like that it is not oily & seems to blend into the skin well, but unless they can tone down the scent, I will not buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Overall I was happy. I have sensitive skin and have a hard time finding moisturizers that don't break me out. This stuff was awesome! Not greasy and oily after applying. Left my face silky feeling. The smell wasn't bad either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was surprised how much I loved this moisturizer! What is amazing about this moisturizer is the texture. It's incredibly smooth and creamy. It moisturizes my skin without making it too greasy. I would definitely purchase this product. My only complaint is that I wish it had a bit of a higher SPF (I like my daily lotion to have an SPF of at least 30). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is great! Not only did it moisturize my face better than what I was currently using, it also gave protection from the sun so I didnt have to use sunblock on my face. It also gave me a nuce ""glow"" so my face didnt look so dull. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Goes on perfectly and absorbs into the skin well unlike most SPF moisturizers I've tried. No residue. It smells very lemony and clean which is an instant pick me up considering the product is applied right on the face. Not heavy. Leaves skin feeling soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think it is great,the clearly brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer spf 15 feels nice upon applying. It didn't irritate my skin and I have sensitive skin. Love it, will recommend to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used it the same day I received it. I was working outside in my garden and used it on my face cause my nose tends to burn easy. I spent 12 hours outside today and after my shower my face was not burnt and my skin felt smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this moisturizer because it's good for your skin I try to clean my face with acne stuff 3 times a week but most of the time the moisturizer has me break out because the oils or it makes me really dry but this made my face smooth and didn't dry me out at all love the smell and feel of this moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First off, it doesn't have a strong sun screen chemical smell. There is still a bit of that chemical scent but it's not like the ones currently on the market. Secondly, I did noticed it made my skin a bit smoother, especially smoothing out my dried out elbows. I hope it's not too expensive because I plan on making this my go-to sunscreen lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do everything that I can to take care of my skin. I have night creams, daily moisturizers, wash morning and night, but I hate putting sunscreen on my face. It's always so sticky and smelly! I'm thrilled that this one isn't. As soon as I put it on, it was absorbed into my skin, so no shine or constant rubbing. The smell is light and quickly goes away. There's absolutely no complaints, just all raves! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've only just received this product, but I already love it! I have very fair skin and even though I don't get sunburned, I freckle so I've been searching for a product that restores complexion as well as protecting my skin. I will definitely be purchasing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have to say I wasn't expecting a positive outcome because I do have very sensitive skin &I usually only moisturize with coconut oil. I have come to realize I also need SPF. This wen on smooth. I had no reactions to it. No redness or breakouts. I found my skn to look brigher and it felt moisturized throughout a long day running errands. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've always been skeptical about moisturizers. I can never seem to find the perfect one for me. Either there too oily or just leave a slime like film on my face. Well this one was perfect. It brightened up my mommy dark under eyes and made my skin feel amazing. It's looked great u see make up or just by itself with lipgloss! Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I enjoy the texture..how creamy it is. I also like how it goes onto my skin. It does not feel sticky and weird as my daughter would say. I will be purchasing this as soon as I use up my sample..GREAT product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have sensitive skin and this product seemed to work fine; there were no adverse reactions. It was very moisturizing. I didn't notice that much of a brightening effect; maybe I will after using it for awhile. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Honestly I really love this product. The ingredients are healthier than I was expecting and the product not only does a nice job of being sunscreen but it also smells great and leaves my skin softer than when I put it on. It doesn't feel like normal sunscreen that can get sticky. Really excited I got to try this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter works great. I like the idea of using it before I leave my house. The sunscreen helps protects my skin. It not only moisturizes my skin it brightens at the same time. That is what I absolutely love about this product. I will continue to buy and adding it to my morning day routine. Did I tell you its oil free and has vitamin C in it also. I recommend this product to everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is perfect because i get sunburn a lot. and when i put it on it was so refreshing to know i wont get sunburn my day at the beach. i liked that it wasn't oily nerveless a great product i will be always using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoyed this sample. It did its job of protecting my skin in the sun. Plus, it was very moisturizing without leaving excess oil on my face,and I don't use heavy products on my face. So I enjoyed it. I let my brother use it and he thought it was lotion. So that's how you know it's a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"One of the amazing moisturizer plus broad spectrum that I have ever had. I am a Garnier user for more than 2 years now and I switched to this new product, I can say this is the greatest ever!! It doesn't give me pimples and keeps my face healthy and glowing.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The best moisturizer I have ever used. It makes my skin so soft and moisturized. I was just starting to get fine lines but after about a month of using this, they are gone. My skin is radiant, and my makeup goes on smoothly. The light rose scent is great. Love it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"After taking the Clearly Brighter Challenge with Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 I found my skin to be a little bit brighter with a more even skin tone. The moisturizer left my skin feeling soft and moist without the weight, or greasiness of some other moisturizers."
"I like it. I do think that it helped to brighten my skin. But I was kind of disappointed that it's essentially just a sunscreen and not so much a moisturizer like it's described to be. If I look at the ingredients, it's all sunscreen related and I wished it would have had more moisturizing properties."
".I have used a few moisturizers that claim to brighten your skins appearance, with little to no results. So, to be honest I was not expecting to see that much of a difference with this product. With that said, On day 1 using Garnier Clearly Brighter I noticed my skin looked brighter and smoother. And after a week not only did my skin look better to me, I had others compliment my skin as well. I also love the fresh floral scent."
at first i didnt think this stuff would make a difference in my skin. i wore it everyday for a week and i could see a difference it protected my face from the sun while it moisturized it and evened my skin. my face has never felt better its not dry anymore.
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a great daily moisturizer and sunscreen. I love how smooth it goes on and it feels nice and cool when applying. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and not at all oily. I also really like the light scent. After using the product for a week, I definitely have noticed my skin looking brighter and my daughters have commented and how smooth mommy's cheeks feel! I would definitely recommend this product to a friend."
I really enjoyed the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. I used this product for only six days before seeing brighter skin! I would recommend this product to anyone needing a good SPF moisturizer. It does NOT leave my face feeling sticky or loaded down with product.
I've used this religiously every day & I absolutely LOVE this product! It goes on light so it moisturizers without feeling heavy or being so greasy that my makeup wears right off like other moisturizer-sunscreens I've used. I love that my skin is being pampered & protected from harmful rays & future sun damage with just 1 simple step. I've already noticed an overall improvement and have even received compliments on how great my skin looks. PLUS it smells GREAT!!
This face lotion not only smells great but it is also refreshing for my skin. I love that by using just a small amount each morning for a week I have already started to show signs of improvement. First my skin started tightening up in areas like my neck and around my eyes but now I can see it is overall BRIGHTER!!! I'm wearing less makeup because of how great my skin looks so I am hooked!!!
I really liked Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 because I did see an improve on my skin in one week. Plus it has SPF15 which is very important to me in a moisturizer without being greasy. It also has a pleasant scent.
"So glad that I had the opportunity to try out this product for free by Garnier and Crowdtap because I probably wouldn't have taken the leap to give it a try. I love that it is a moisturizer with an spf15 but most importantly it doesn't have an over perfumed scent which means I don't have to struggle using it. While my skin might not be ""brighter"" it is 10x softer which is a benefit to me!"
"Simply put, Amazing. My skin looks and feels 10 times better. I'm in the Sun all day and I never burn using this stuff. My skin is bright and smooth all the time now. The cream feels awesome on my skin. And it doesn't have a weird smell like some creams that claim to work like this one. I will be using this stuff forever."
I loved Garnier's SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF15! It goes on so nicely after cleansing my skin and really absorbs right in... leaving no greasy feel at all. My skin just feels refreshed... and I love it. My daughter is also using this and loves it.... as she is a huge fan of all things Garnier! Thanks for the fabulous new product line and I will be trying other SkinActive products in the near future.
"First off, this stuff smells great! Fresh and clean smelling. The moisturizing is on par with my Cetaphil Daily Moisturizer, which I've stayed loyal too. I didn't notice my skin being ""brighter"" after using this, but I did enjoy the SPF that is included. All these factors make a pretty solid choice for a moisturizer, and it's light enough that I can see it becoming my go-to for the summer months."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 has a lovely consistency and moisturizes very well. It has a soft scent that makes it feel like a luxurious experience every time you apply it. I especially love the knowledge that it is protecting my skin from the sun with the SPF15 as it is moisturizing. Lastly, I did notice that my skin had more of a glow to it as I consistenly used it. I would definitely recommend this product because it is multi-faceted and does each job well."
"I loved how my skin felt after trying this, it was so smooth. It has not been that smooth since I was very young. I wish that feeling lasted a little longer.It was non greasy, and felt nice once on. Light.The scent was not the best for me, too strong in my opinion."
I loved how my skin felt after just a short week of using Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It made it feel softer and brighter without it being sticky or heavy on my skin. The fragrance was also amazing. I also loved the double duty this product had. Of being both a moisturizer AND sunscreen. Love it.
This product did what it said. I saw a brighter note even toned skin over the course of the week. I love that there's SPF in it too. That's important for me when selecting a face lotion. The only thing I didn't care for was it stung around my eye area. I didn't put it in my eye of course. But just the smell or something got up in there and made then sting. I also have very sensitive eyes so that could be why. Previous face lotions have never sting before.
"I feel as though the product works really well and achieves what it claims to do. The only down side, in my opinion, is that I can not get over the smell. It kind of smells chemically. I wish it had a fresher smell but most moisturizers do smell slightly unpleasant."
This moisturizing sunscreen is lightweight and feels amazing on my skin. It doesn't feel like I'm wearing anything on my face and I can even workout with it on my face and I had no breakouts all week. The only thing because I couldn't tell if I had sweated it away or just because it was gentle but how long does it last? Since it's not summertime and even with the rain this week I wondered if it came off or was ineffective.
"I loved Garnier Clearly Brighter . After one week of using my face is so soft and smooth. My sunspots are starting to fade. This is my new face moisturizer. I never thought I would change my face routine, until I tried Clearly Brighter. I will highly recommend to friends and family."
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a wonderful product that goes on smoothly. It's not heavy and does not cause breakouts, it just makes your skin feel and look amazing while providing protection from the sun. I definitely recommend!"
"This has been a pretty nice moisturizer I think. I am not quite sure it has ""brightened"" my skin tone, but it has helped my skin be more moisturized. It is a little bit oily for my tastes, but it has not made my skin break out or have any major negative actions occur. Overall, I am very happy with this. I did receive a sample for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
"This moisturizer is a lovely creamy consistency. You only need a little bit to do the job, and when you rub it on, it is so cool and refreshing! After using this product for a week, my acne had decreased, my skin was smoother than ever, and my skin tone was very even and glowy. I love this product!"
"I really like this new Garnier lotion! It smells great, kind of like fruity green tea. It's strong enough to keep my skin moisturized without being too heavy. After taking the Cleary Brighter Challenge I did notice my skin felt smoother, but I'm not sure if it got much brighter. Either way, I really like this lotion and will continue using it!"
"This is the best facial moisturizing product I've used in quite some time. It's healthy for my skin and helps smooth out facial texture while still moisturizing and protecting my skin from sun exposure. Make sure not to apply too closely to your eyes, and you will notice significant results in less than a week or daily use."
"I'm loving the new Garnier Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer! It instantly brightens and smooths the skin as good as any primer while giving you the added benefits of moisture, an SPF, Antioxidant Complex and being oil-free! It's really an all in one product!"
"I absolutely love Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer 15. It is so light and smooth, you barely notice you are wearing it. There is no oily residue after applying it to your face. After using it for a week as recommended for the challenge my skin in a sense glows and feels healthier. ! I love it."
This product had really easy packaging that has colors that stand out. My face was definitely brighter and more well hydrated after the one week challenge. It also smelled really good and fresh like flowers and orange. A couple people thought I was wearing perfume but I just could not stop smelling myself. LOL! It provides moderate protection from the sun but I would not use this in place of sunscreen! I really like this product and will continue its use!
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is light and non greasy. It leaves skin moisturized with a subtle glow. I found the scent to be pleasant, but a bit too strong for my taste. It works well on my skin, and does not cause breakouts. Overall, it's a nice moisturizer and my skin looks great after using it!"
"This is the best product for my light, sensitive skin! I've used other SPF15 moisturizers in the past and they feel pasty and struggle to absorb in my skin which is frustrating. With Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 it goes on smoothly, smells great, absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and looking radiant!"
I really like this product. It has a very light scent to it that does not last on your face. The texture is thick and applies nicely. It absorbs into the skin quickly and does not leave any kind of greasy feel to it. It gave my skin a beautiful healthy glow to it. I could definitely see the difference in a matter of days. Love this product and highly recommend it to anyone looking to brighten up their face!
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 works easily with my busy life. Goes on smooth and non greasy. Leaves your skin feeling hydrated and protected. I did see some improvement in texture and brightness. It left me feeling young and bright.
"I love this product because keeps my skin hydrated and looking great, but also because it has vitamin c and saves space on my coounter no need of different lotion to put during the day with just garnier clearly brighter broad spectrum spf15 is all I need."
When I first tried it I was very skeptical like I always am. But after about a week I can feel the difference in my skin. It was smoother and not as dry. This product also was protecting my skin from the sun with SPF15 in the moisturizer. I gave it 5 Stars because it did everything it advertised!
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is perfect for keeping my skin soft, moisturized and protected from the sun. Living in Florida my moisturizer has to have SPF. Garnier SkinActive has a fresh light scent that clearly hydrates my skin to leave it smooth and beautiful. It doesn't leave greasy feel or shine to my skin."
This is the best moisturizer I have ever used. I have oily skin with dry patched and all other moisturizers would make my skin shiny and oily like I never washed it. I hated that so I would just put it on my dry patches when I'd be out but this one didn't make my face shiny at all. I used it with no problem and I like that it has an SPF since I always forget sunscreen.
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 leaves your face feeling nourished and refreshed. I felt like my skin was smoother and brighter after just one week. Would definitely recommend anyone trying this, especially before big events to prepare your skin for all the cameras!"
"Unlike other moisturizers I've used in the past, this didn't sting on the more sensitive areas of my face. The smell was pleasant and a little goes a long way. The only thing I'm concerned about is I got a few breakouts on my chin but I'm not sure if it's from the lotion or just stress."
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daiily Moisturizer SPF15 makes my skin look and feel great. It absorbs easily and isn't greasy. I love that it has SPF since I often forget to wear sunscreen if I'm just running errands or going to work!
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is amazing! This lotion spreads so nicely. A little bit goes such a long way and keeps my face moisturized all day! I feel like my skin is absorbing the lotion well and improving its appearance.
I love this product! I went out and purchased a full size version. On the full version I love the pump and you are able to twist it to lock which makes it convenient to toss into your tote bag or for travel without worrying about it spilling. I love how it absorbs into my skin instantly without leaving a sticky residue and the formula isn't too thick or too thin.
"I have been using the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer for a couple of weeks now and I am very happy with the results. I find it to be nice and lightweight and it absorbs nicely into the skin and the sunscreen smell is barely noticeable. I have noticed my complexion is brighter and less visible redness to it. I would definitely recommend this moisturizer to anyone looking for sun protection as well as brighter, smoother skin."
My favorite thing about Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is that I noticed result in less than a week. My skin felt so smooth and soft. It definitely gave me a glow and healthier looking skin because my coworkers asked me what I was using on my face because they noticed my complexion had changed. What surprised me the most was that it didn't feel heavy after use or oily which is something I had experienced and disliked about other brands.
I was really excited to try this product. As it was my first time trying sunscreen amd moisturizer. I liked that it didnt make my skin dry out. It goes on nice and spreads out evenly. Made my face feel really smooth and soft. Doesnt actually brighten but I did see a clearier tone. I dont really like the smell which bothers me. It kind of burned and will not be using this again.
"Garnier's SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF15 is now my favorite daily moisturizer. My face instantly felt softer, the product was easy to apply, no oily residue, and my skin looked brighter in just a few days! I'm not going back to my old moisturizer!"
First off I loved how hydrating it was on my skin. I tend to have combo to dry skin and this made my skin feel hydrated and supple the next morning after just the first use. I love the fact that this has SPF included which is especially great for the spring and summer for me when I'm out in the sun daily with my daughter. This is also great for use under makeup!
"I loved the scent of this product and how seamlessly it blended into my skin without leaving behind an oily residue or white streaks. I think the formula could be slightly improved by increasing the SPF to 30, 50, 75 or even 100 for areas where sun damage can be a concern."
"i liked this product because it was very moisturizing, but on the other hand i did not like that it has SPF because i have really sensitive skin, and this causes breakouts. maybe a little less SPF would be a lot better. But overall it is an okay product."
"The moisturizer feels good, it's not greasy, it keeps skin hydrated and offers sun protection. The scent is the best. The issue I had was that it caused my face to break out like crazy. There must be something in the ingredients that my skin does not like."
"The clearly brighter challenge helped my skin to be brighter and more beautiful! In just under a week, I noticed smoother skin and even tones. It was great to use before my daily workouts because it has SPF 15 so I know I would be protected against fine lines and sun damage. I would recommend that all women try the challenge. Its oil free so theres no need to worry against breakouts ."
"I really love Garnier's Brightening moisturizer with SPF15! I will definitely purchase it in the future. I like the thick texture that comes out of the tube, but also how it completely soaks into my skin and never leaves it feeling slick or oily. I also love that I have a layer of SPF on under my makeup that doesn't cause any problems with my foundation. A definite win!"
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is light and makes my skin feel wonderful! I have been using it everyday and especially appreciate the SPF15 protection while out doing much needed yard work! No heavy oily residue, very smooth and seemless - just love it!"
"I think this is a good daily moisturizer that help my skin look better with time. I saw a difference in 7 days I can't wait to see how I look after 30 days. I love that I can put this on my face, then my primer, then foundation and I have no issue of my face itching from the SPF. I love that I can find this at any drug store and can get it when I need it."
"While the Garnier Clearly Brighter absorbed quickly when I put it on, it is not the moisturizer for me. About half way in the day my face became an oily mess. I would have to wash my face in the afternoon because it became so oily. Also, it made my face break out so much that I had to stop using it on day 5 of 7 day challenge."
After the challenge I seen my skin transform instantly ...Nomore using messy oils and thick cremes ...I can have flawless skin with a dab of Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter !!! I feel and see the results in just 7 days I'm so happy my skin is too !!! Thank you ...
"The Garnier SkinActive moisturizer was great for brightening up my dull winterized skin. The product smelled good and put me in a great mood until I spotted a big fat zit! I haven't had acne since my teen years. Unfortunately I can't give this the full five stars because of my experience, but who says it won't work on your skin? I must have pretty sensitive skin."
"A great daily moisturizer to be used alone or under makeup.Will leave your face feeling beautiful.Fixes faded skin.Leaves a non greasy,non oily feeling that last throughout the day.Provides adequate protection fronnthe sun without clogging pores.Smells great and goes on smooth and soaks in the skin quickly."
"I really enjoyed my experience with Garnier Clearly Brightening and Smoothing Moisturizer. For a whole week, I had changed my facial routine and tried to use the moisturizer in the morning and at night. I did see a change in my skin, there was a hint of brightness and my dark spots such as acne marks were lighter. (I was given the free samples to try and share, i was not paid to review it. )"
"I'm very happy with this moisturizer. I like the scent since it wasn't over-powering. I loved that it didn't cause acne breakouts. I felt like I had a matte finish on my face, which is awesome. I didn't feel like I had to wipe off any excess product."
"I didn't feel like Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisurizer SPF15 really brightened my skin. However, I did love the scent and texture. I felt protected leaving my house every morning knowing that I had SPF15 on my face as well."
"After using the garnier clearly brighter moisturizer, my skin has been brighter, softer, and healthier. I love that it has spf in it, and it smells great too which is an added bonus. I have oily skin and this product did NOT cause my skin to be oily. I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a great skin care routine!**i received this product complimentary from garnier for testing and review purposes, but all opinions are my own."
"Night and day that is the difference between what I was using and Garier Skin Active Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. Not only does it makes a huge difference, for the better, to the look and feel of my skin but it also protects my skin from the harmful rays of the Sun."
"always had a problem with dry skin and haven't been able to find the right moisturizer but after using this product I not only have no more dry skin in those pesky spots, but no breakouts and my skin looks smooth and shiney! And to top it all off moisturizing creams usually stink but garnier smells great!!!"
"I like this product a lot. It moisturizes my skin while protecting my skin from the sun's UV rays. It soaks into my skin fast and it does not leave my skin greasy at all. I would definately recommend this to my friends. The only thing I did not like was I did not think it was necessary to add perfumy scents to this product.. I don't feel it is a good thing to put fragrances on your face where it can possibly cause irritation and even acne. Other than that though, I really like it. I will continue to use it."
The only time that I have ever been able to see a product actually working. My skin gets a little smoother and more even toned every day. My only complaint is that I'm a little greasier than normal at the end of the day but it is not breaking me out. The product packaging is slightly confusing because it talks more about it being sunscreen than moisturizer.
"This is a great product. The Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer provides sunscreen with a SPF 15. It contains an antioxidant complex of vitamin C + LHA. It helps prevent sunburn and if used as directed, decreases the risk of skin cancer & early skin aging caused by the sun. It provides great moisturization and is lightweight. This works great used under your make up. It helps keep my face from being shiny during the day. I received this for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
I love love love Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It worked so good on my skin! After only using it once - It left my skin soft & super hydrated. I'll definitely be using this product in the future!
"I wanted to like this moisturizer but it was a bit too greasy for my oily skin. I know it was oil-free, but I have used moisturizers in the past that do not make me feel overly moisturized as this one did. I did notice a brighter overall look to my skin and that was really awesome but unfortunately, I'd need a version for oily skin. I do also really like that it contains SPF but I wish sometimes wish moisturizers would put a higher SPF."
"Delightfully scented moisturizer with multiple benefits packed into one powerfully effective formula. After a few days, I noticed that the condition of my skin was gradually improving as it appeared lighter and felt smoother. I would recommend this product to everyone seeking to regain their youth & vitality in appearance"
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 has been a wonderful addition to my skin care routine! It's thick, creamy texture allows to really see where you are applying it, and my skin just drinks it in! I have noticed a reduction of age spots and that my skin is firmer with prolonged use. I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for a new facial moisturizer with SPF built in! I received a sample through Crowdtap."
I have used alot of moisturizers and none of them ever seem to guve me the results I need or want. I want something that not only keeps my skin soft but protects it and keeps it looking young and fresh. All of this qualities can be found in this tiny bottle.
I have always had a great experience with Garnier products so it wasn't a surprise that the Garnier SkinActive Brightening and Smoothing Moisturizer with SPF 15 was amazing. Has a lovely fragrance and is lightweight. It did everything that it claims to do. I noticed a considerable difference in the texture and glow of my face. I am a happy customer!
I hit 50 in Dec. and my skin has been dull and tired looking. Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter has helped my skin spring back to life giving it a clean and healthy glow once again. No more dull and dry tired looking skin. It is now fresh and healthy . Feeling and looking refreshed.
"Loved the new moisturizer by garnier. The clearly brighter moisturizer is a great lightweight moisturizer that leaves your skin silky smooth and glowing, it has SPF to protect your skin and best part is you see results in as little as a week of using it."
"I absolutely love this product. First of all, I have combination skin. Right after washing my face it feels so dry and just awful. I applied this moisturizer daily before applying my makeup and it took away the dry feeling. Also during the the day my face gets super oily so I cannot use moisturizers usually. This one did not make my skin deep greasy like most moisturizers. I love how light it feels on my skin and how easy it was to use."
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 arrived at my door a few weeks ago from Crowdtap. They sent me this amazing product to test out and review. I have used it since then and the results have been amazing. My skin feels so youthful for my age a product that makes my skin feel that way is very difficult. This moisturizer also protected me from the sun which is always a plus. It goes on very smooth and dries up quickly which I love.
"As a woman of color I am very cautious of the facial products I use due to my skin needs and personal skin sensitivity, It took me a couple of days to start seeing results but after about 3 or four I did not just feel the deep moisture but my skin tone had even out. Certain spots that were darker brighten along with the rest. I also felt good knowing that there is also SPF protection, its like enhanced sun protection with extra benefits."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is the best. I've noticed change in my skin tone since the third day of utilization. My skin is smooth, soft, and radiantly gorgeous. If your looking for quick results, you have to try Garnier Clearly Brighter. I'm glad that I did!"
"I was surprised at how much I actually really like this product. It not only brightens my skin, but truly does smooth it. My under eye circles are even lightening up, and my blemishes are few and far between. Love this product and will be using daily!"
"I'm a huge fan of this! It's very lightly scented, which I love (reminds me of a perfume I've used in the past, but I can't identify which one it is), and is the perfect consistency - not thick like some sunscreens and not thin like some moisturizers. And by combining my sunscreen and moisturizer, it encourages me to keep my skin hydrated all summer!"
this is a great product it makes my morning routine much simpler because it not only moisturizes my skin but also protects it with spf15. This moisturizer has a nice light scent. I love how has not only softened but also given my skin a nice bright glow!
Overall this is the best facial moisturizer I have ever used. I can clearly see a difference in my skin with the 7 day challenge. My skin has a healthier glow to it. You can clearly see that it's a smoothie and feel it as well. Works well with my naturally oily skin and leave me feeling hydrated not oily.
"I love using the Garnier skin active. It makes me skin feel amazing. After using it for a week I could already feel and see the difference. It has already become party of my morning routine. My skin looks younger, clear, and smoother. I have told all my friend to try this and you should too."
"I think this product is amazing! It has spf which I love! Goes on smooth and silky and runs right in with no residue! I noticed results right away, on the second day! When I saw my mom she commented on how bright my skin looked and asked if I was pregnant!! Lol love this stuff"
"The best thing about SkinActive Clearly Brighter is that it's a two-in-one, non-greasy moisturizer. My face feels great after putting it on and I don't have to worry about sun protection because it's build right in. It never seemed like my face looked or felt greasy after putting it on and I can tell my skin is happier after just a couple uses."
"I love that the Garnier clearly brighter moisturizer contains spf. It made my skin smooth and soft without any greasy feeling when applying. It is a great moisturizer for daily use. The lotion does have a light fragrance. This is the only thing I did not like and the reason I only gave the moisturizer 4 out of 5 stars. It is not too strong, and after it has be on for awhile I do not notice anymore."
"I love Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. In one week, it has improved the overall look of my skin. I have less red spots, and the dark-sun spots are lighter. It's very easy to use and light on the skin. There is no sticky residue at all. It makes your skin fill great, but you can't even feel it!"
Garnier's Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is the best skin product I have ever tried. Everything you need to look and feel beautiful is in one bottle. No more having 10 bottles of Moisturizer to make your skin look fantastic. Sunscreen to protect your beautiful face. Vitamins and antioxidants to make and keep your skin smooth and glowing. What more could you ask for.
"Really do love this cream. First of all it takes such a small amount to spread around the face; Second, it absorbs very quickly into the skin so you don't have to wait a life time to be able to apply your foundation and make up if you want; Third, it has an SPF 15 built into the skin so I don't have to apply yet another layer of sun protection before applying make up! SCORE! The cream is light, yet creamy and is so easy to apply. Love this cream!"
"I love this product! It goes on nice and smooth. It isn't too thick and heavy, rather it goes on lightly and leaves my skin feeling soft all day. After a few days I really noticed how much more visibly brighter my skin was because of this moisturizer."
I liked it for sun defense. It absorbed quickly so I can move on to my makeup. However I felt I got oiler quicker when I used this. I also did not notice much brightening after one week. Overall I I still like this moisturizer and hope to see better results with continued use.
I was having an issue with very dry skin before I started using this even with other moisturizers and Garnier has proven once again it is well worth trying their products. I love that is hasn't broken me out and hasn't caused my nose or forehead to be oily. I love that it has taken care of the dryness and evened out my skin tone. Thank you Crowdtap for sending me this free sample and getting me hooked on Garnier SkinActive.
I like how it wasnt greasy as it went on my skin. It felt soft again like I was twenty. I didnt see it brigtening my skin though but I do like to use a lot of make up so I might of not noticed. Because my skin was so soft it made th make up go on better and loke better. Plus I liked that my skin was being protected by damaging rays of the sun.
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is amazing! I love moisturizers, but this is by far my favorite. In a matter of applications ( I did twice daily) my skin was so much brighter and felt so much better. The sunscreen was an added bonus, I use this every day!"
Garnier's Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Moisturizer goes on smooth and sinks in quickly. There is no oily residue left behind and it protects me from the harmful sun.I have very fair Irish skin and red hair so I need an SPF daily. I noticed a nice youthful glow and even skin tone very quickly!
"I think I need more time using this product to see how I really feel.I like that it has a pleasant scent to it, I usually avoid moisturizer with scents. It is light weight, absorbs nicely. My skin always felt smooth & soft after applying and through out the day.My make up went on with no problem or not pilling . I did notice a shine to my skin but not sure if its the formula making my skin look oily or something it it heloing it look more brighter and radiant. I am a fan of the SPF , some spf is better than now"
"I absolutely love this moisturizer! It's not too heavy and didn't cause any acne or blackheads at all. Love knowing there's sunscreen in there which helps to fight aging and reduce the chance for skin cancer. After using this product for the first day, I noticed a difference in my skin. After a week, I noticed there were less fine lines and the tone of my skin was much more even."
"I am so glad I got the opportunity to sample this. I loved the product, it went on light, smooth and did NOT feel greasy. I have sensitive skin and love that I had no issues with break outs, clogged pores, etc. I will continue using the product regularly."
I have been looking for a facial Moisturizer and I think I can stop looking. I could feel a difference after one use of Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. And after a week I could see a difference. I highly recommend those searching for a facial moisturizer to give this product a try! Plus it has SPF15 in it.
I absolutely love the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15.It is great to use on a daily basis.It goes on very smooth and does not make your skin feel oily or greasy.It has a pleasant smell and does not cause any type of skin irritations.

After taking the challenge and using this product for a full week, I was amazed apt how beautiful my skin looked and how smooth it felt."
"I really liked Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. My skin is very clear and smooth. My only issue with this product is how much it smells like sunscreen. I find for a face lotion with such a low SPF, it shouldn't smell so much like sunscreen."
I was a bit hesitant at first to try a different moisturizer than what I was used to but I am so glad I did. My skin feels and looks so much smoother and healthier. I am amazed at how my skin has a natural glow to it now. The moisturizer itself has a good smell to it and best of all it has a SPF already in it so no need to put on a separate one! This is definitely my new go to moisturizer from now on!
I highly recommend garniers clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer. It left my skin feeling the best it has in a long time. So smooth and soft... And also brightened my complexion. I also love the fact it contains SPF and does not have that strong odor of sunscreen.
"I really like the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. I love that it has SPF - I am extremely pale, so SPF is a necessity for me on a daily basis. It definitely moisturizes my face and keeps it from getting too dry!"
The Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 I received to try is silky and goes on very smooth. The moisturizer soaked into my skin and left a delicious scent on my skin throughout the day. I keep one at my desk now so I always have it on hand.
After using the product the first day I noticed how it left my skin feeling fresh clean and moisturized. I've used many products and this one worked good for my skin. Some products make my skin dry but this one worked wonders. I will continue to use this product as my daily moisturizer!
I really loved this moisturizer. It goes on light was quickly and easily absorbed by my skin. My skin felt instantly softer and smoother. It has a nice light scent that isn't overpowering. It made my skin look and feel softer and brighter by the end of the week. I will continue using it.
"There are many moisturizers on the market that promise brighter skin that just fall short of their claims. Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer on the other hand does just as promised. It has moisturized my dry skin and brightened my dull complexion in just a week. It is an amazing product with a light scent and non greasy formula. The best part is, it also protects my skin from harmful uv rays with SPF15."
"I used my garnier clearly brighter brightening daily moisturizer for a week, morning and evening. My oily skin was calm, it felt light and not weighed down with a heavy cream. My skin felt like it could breathe! I love the soft scent that was left behind and how nice my skin glows. It feels like there is nothing on it, yet it feels good!"
"I thought that the product went on very smoothly and made my skin brighter initially. However, after using the product for a couple of days, I didn't feel that my skin looked a lot better. I think that my regular Neutrogena moisturizer worked a lot better. I did like that it had SPF 15 in it though. anything with sun protection in it is great!"
"Within 2 days of using this product my skin felt so soft and smooth. I have already told several friends about this, and even let one friend try one of my samples. I will be purchasing this for sure, My friend is going to purchase on her next visit to the store.."
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a must have moisturizer. The thickness of this moisturizer seeps deep beneath the skin which provides adequate moisture to the skin. The scent is really nice and does not linger. You will see an improvement in the appearance and feel of your skin within the first week of using this moisturizer.

After one week fine lines and wrinkles were visably reduced, and my skin was softer and brighter. The lotion has a pleasent smell, goes on feeling clean, not greasy or oily. It's my favorite facial moisturizer now!"
This moisturizer is the best around. Garnier has done it again. With it's nice pleasant smell of a light citrus scent. I felt confident being out in the sun with this product on my face. The lightweight feel and complete coverage was amazing! I'll never be without this moisturizer in my purse or gymbag. I've tried it and my skin felt softer and looked more glowing in just a week.
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter moisturizer was so awesome! I figured it would be pretty good, being a Garnier product, but it truly exceeded my expectations! It helped brighten my skin, but it also did a beautiful job moisturizing without making my temperamental skin oily. Really love this stuff!!"
"Before using this moisturizer, my skin was a bit dry and I was starting to show my age. I am not usually one to make sure I put on sunscreen everyday. I usually only put it on if I was going to be in the blaring sun. I started using the Garnier SkinActive Moisturizer and I can not believe the difference in my skin! It is so much more hydrated! It looks and feels younger! I am going to be wearing this every single day!"
Great product that has your skin feeling refreshed and protected from the sunset harmful rays. I loved how it made my skin feeling hydrated and not really at all it was a great sample thank-you crowdtap for the samples I can't wait to share them with friends and family
"I started using this moisturizer two weeks ago on my combination skin. I have mild acne that sometimes is aggravated by too heavy of a face lotion. I loved that this product had an Spf , but worried that it might make me break out. After only a week, I was surprised to find that my skin felt smoother and softer with use. The spf did NOT irritate my skin, and gave me added protection with my moisturizer."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is an amazing product! Not only does my skin look great.. It feels great! Its soft and noticeably glowing!Garnier SkinActive goes on light and smooth. My pores dont feel clogged-blocked. Unlike other products, it doesn't leave your skin super shiny and oily. It smells good and a small amount goes a long way. The SPF15 is an added bonus!#Clear #Moisturized #Skin #Protection"
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is an amazing product. After only a week a started to notice smoother and brighter skin and the longer I used it I also started to notice that my skin looked more hydrated and my skin texture was more even and not as dry around my lips and nose. I will never go back to my old moisturizer.
"I tried the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer for a few days and really noticed that my skin felt smoother and clearer.It glides on very smoothly and leaves a very pleasant citrus scents.I love that this one is lightweight, I just put it on and it absorbs very quikly . My skin also feels so much smoother than before, I am very happy with this product and will continue to use it."
I absolutely love how soft & smooth this makes my skin feel. I love how my skin is brighter. I have used several brightening products in the past and they haven't been as effective. On days where I don't want to use makeup I am satisfied using this product by itself.
i have been just this as a part of my skin care routine after cleansing love the consistency I hate thick creams this one goes smooth on skin and keeps it soft and moisturized through out the day SPF 15 is surely a bonus .the skin feels supple and clearer for sure this is a hit from garnier line for sureI am surely gonna buy more for soon
"At first, I thought I liked this moisturizer. However, after using it for several days with no other changes in my routine, my skin started to break out a lot for me. It felt oily and there were a couple of days were I had to go wash my face in the middle of work because my face became itchy from the oil."
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is one of the best moisturizers for applying makeup. It made the makeup go on smoothly and flawlessly.That's where the good qualities end. My face broke out worse than ever on day 3 of using this moisturizer. Plus, you can't get anywhere close to your eyes because it burns. So I still had to use another moisturizer around my eyes. I definitely do not recommend this stuff."
I love how healthy and smooth this makes my skin! I used it for a while but I could already tell a huge difference after only 1 week! I was really excited to share my samples with my friends so they could experience it too! My favorite part is that is also has SPF!
I love it. My skin feels great. It immediately feels hydrated after I put it on. You dont need a lot either so it will last you a good amount of time. I have noticed how even my face appears now. I actually noticed a difference about 4 days in. I used it in the morning and at night before bed. I highly recommend this product.
"My favorite part of Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 was that it noticeably brightened my skin and evened my skin tone. It also smells clean and fresh and dries quickly so I am able to apply make up quickly. It is great for my fast paced lifestyle, and it makes me look like a million bucks without spending a fortune."
I have really enjoyed using this to soften my skin and brighten it. It brought my face to life since I have been using this. It will be another Garnier product added to my skin care routine. I really love how fast this started working. Made my face feel and look great. A little bit goes a long way. Brings the smile back on your face because it just brightened it up.
"I love this product. At first I really didn't think it could do what it says. But after a week of using it, my skin has gotten brighter and is more smooth. My skin looks great, I have a glow to my face. I love that it has sunblock in it. I love the smell too, I think it smells really good. It is creamy but has a thicker consistency. I love it."
I have sensitive skin. It's prone to breakouts and I'm always hesitant when I'm trying a new moisturizer. I absolutely love Garneir Clearly Brighter. It's so light weight. It didn't irritate my skin and my face looked fantastic. I love the glow it gave me. I will absolutely be adding this to my skin care routine.
"I was skeptical when i first got this product, but i must say those feelings were gone immediately after i tried it. I could tell a difference just after the first few days. Even more of a difference after a week of using it. I am a huge fan. I would recommend this to anyone who jas dry skin issues like i do. And not only foes itwork for my dryness it brightened my color up as well. This stuff is amazing."
I have looked for a good moisturizer that also acted as a sunscreen for years. So many other products really dried out my skin or didn't offer the protection I was seeking. Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is different! It offers everything my skin needs without weighing it down. It is a MUST have!!
"I have always been on the redder side with my skin and it has bothered me for as long as I can remember. But with the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 it has helped reduce the redness and has evened out my skin tone.The moisturizer cream is easy to apply and leaves the skin feeling hydrated. There is no greasy feeling after applying it. I would really recommend this, whether young or young at heart.I received a sample for free from Crowdtap for my honest review"
"Honestly I was impressed on how this Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brightening & Smoothing moisturizer left my face. It doesn't leave my face oily and it makes it look bright clean. My face feel soft, smooth and it absorbs fast. Best thing it has pleasant scent. I would recommend this product to everyone"
"I love this as a moisturizer! It's very light and seeps into your skin quickly. It doesn't leave behind a greasy residue. It also lasts a long time so I don't feel like I need to keep putting it on throughout the day. I didn't get to test the SPF aspect yet because there has been no sun (insert sad face here), so I can't comment on that. I would say the only thing I don't like about it is that it has a strong scent."
Overall this Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing daily moisturizer is really amazing. The moisturizer is white and the scent is very florals but it's really amazing. I love that it's oil-free and with vitamin c. It's really done wonders for my face and made my skin feel very smooth.
"I really like Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15! It's a bonus to have a facial moisturizer that includes SPF15, it's so important to take care of your skin. Also, two products in one saves some time! The lotion applies smooth and light, easy to get good coverage. It definitely moisturizes and the benefits last all day. I'd highly recommend!"
"I loved that Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter left my skin feeling hydrated. I also liked how it didn't leave my skin feeling greasy. Overall I enjoyed the product, however I didn't like the strong scent. I would have enjoyed it better if the product was unscented."
"I really like this lotion, I've been using it daily since I got it. I love how smooth it goes on. I'm not a huge fan of greasy,thick lotion for my face so this is perfect. I love that it is a sun screen too so I don't have to apply more lotion to my face"
"I loved taking the clearly brighter challenge because I love this moisturizer and after using it for a while I love the way my skin feels. I love the smell, and how it leaves my skin feeling fresh. I enjoyed the way it felt under my makeup and the added bonus of SPF is nice, but i wish the spf was higher so that i could feel comfortable wearing it in hotter temperatures. I will purchase this one again as it seems to do the trick, but not sure if it brightens my face up substantially"
I like using this moisturizer in the morning under my makeup. It helps me apply my makeup smoothly and evenly. When I'm all done my face has a smoother and brighter look and I'm ready to face the day. I also love that it has an spf 15 to protect my skin.
I was really happy to try this out because I have uneven skin. The scent is pleasant. Sort of like a light pear scent. The moisturizer glides on smoothly. Doesn't leave a sticky feeling either. I've been using it for 8 days and already see the diffrence in my skin.
Love the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It does a great job of getting your skin soft and smooth. In the 7 day challenge I saw a big difference. Love that it has sunblock already in it which helps protect your skin even more. It has definitely given me more confidence.
"I love this product. The added benefit of having SPF15 in it definitely makes it the best moisturizer on the market. I used it for a week and I could definitely tell the difference in the way my skin looked. It looked more moist and vibrant. It had a glow to it that you don't see often when you're 60 like I am. I enjoy feeling like my skin is radiant and I think this product definitely did it. I felt comfortable using it alone, using it over my anti-aging cream and using it under my make up. It's an all around wonder."
I got the chance to try out Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer for free. I took the challenge and used this product for the week. I noticed that my facial redness and my skin tone have started looking better. I also like that this moisturizer is making my skin less flakey.
"I love this product. I love how it was non greasy, Blended well with my skin, and work wonderfully as a basis for any foundation or makeup. I love how my skin felt after wearing it. And I love the look and texture of it now as well. I like the fact that it didn't have a sunscreen odor or a chemical smell to it like some facial moisturizers have. I can't wait to continue this treatment and know that the product also lasts a long time."

I liked how fast it disappeared when rubbing it on my face and neck, and the small container easily fit into my purse or pocket so that I could carry it with me in case I needed additional SPF."
"I love Garniers skin active clearly brighter moisturizer, it is lightweight and smells clean and fresh. I used it once a day for a week and my skin didn't break out, like some moisturizers have done before. Garners clearly brighter moisturizer didn't cause my face to become more oily. I have a combination of dry and oily skin so sometimes it is hard to find something that doesn't make the other worse. I would recommend Garniers clearly brighter moisturizers to anyone."
"This product is amazing, after using it or only a couple of days, I noticed my dull skin have life again, it doesn't matter your age, young or old, you should take care of your skin and with Review Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15, it does the job for you."
"Pros: Effective moisturizer and sunscreen. Prevented sunburn on a very sunny day. Kept my skin feeling soft.Cons: I didn't care for the scent. It's a little too chemical-y, perfume-y smelling for my taste. Personally, I prefer unscented products. Also, I prefer to use products that have the cruelty-free logo on the package."
"I am in love with the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15. Before I received a sample for free, I used the full size product and fell in love. I have never finished a moisturizer because I normally get tired of it but I actually went put and bought more as soon as I ran out. I noticed that my skin looked like it had a beautiful glow and it just felt soft all of the time."
"I liked this product overall, but it caused me to breakout on my forehead. I waited to complete a review on this product until my breakout died down a bit, but I still have tiny bumps all over my forehead. Although I can not get over the smell of the product it smells like heaven, I love it so much. I would recommend this to a friend with dry skin!"
"This lotion is amazing! I am so picky when it comes to any type of lotion because I HATE greasy skin. It makes me cringe. This lotion absorbs so quickly and is light and refreshing. It has great moisturizing power though! I love that it gives protection with antioxidants and SPF. The smell is light and airy, not super overwhelming. It lives up to it's claims and has definitely brightened my skin. I will continue to by this the rest of my life. I hope they never stop making it! Try it out, you will not be disappointed."
I loved the light smell of this cream. Wasn't over powerful but just faint enough to notice the scent. Unlike other facial moisturizers this goes on very light and is not greasy at all. My skin is on the sensitive side but with this I didn't experience any negative skin reactions. After a week of using only this my skin is noticeably smooth and clear.
"I have been using clearly brighter for a little while now. Before, my face just felt and looked dry. My skin had no shine. My makeup looked like I'd be applying it over a leather mask.After using Clearly Brighter, my face just looks more vibrant. My skin feels better and more moisturized and my makeup looks way better. I am extremely pleased with how well this stuff works. I have shared my samples with m sisters, parents, and best friends."
This is one of the nicest moisturizers I've used in a while. The first thing I noticed was how nice it smelled and my mother felt the same when she tried it. We loved the light scent! I noticed my skin was getting smoother after each use and I felt less self conscious taking photos even without foundation.
*I received a free sample of this product for testing and review purposes. The following review contains my own honest ones. I have used this product for 7 days now. It is nice and gentle on my sensitive skin. It has a strong floral scent which I don't care for. It has a nice creamy texture and absorbs well. I leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.
"At first this made my face red but after the 3rd day it started to ease off and evened out my skin tones and made my skin so soft with a touch of a glow. i really like this and plan on sticking with it. it dont have a bad smell and thats a plus for me, i wash my hands 2 times after i use it because it feels oily on the hands but not the face."
This is a great moisturizer. It makes my skin soft without making it oily. I can see results after using it for only a week. My skin has a glow to it and I have had people comment that my skin looks great. You get a great moisturizer with added sunscreen to protect your skin from the harmful rays. I absolutely love this product!!
"that is the best moisturizer that ever used it,i used daily every morning and love it,just need a small amount to apply on the face,so easy and nice to apply,smells amazing,and my skin after i apply feels so soft like a baby's skin,after one week i started to see changes in my skin,became more brighter,was glowing and looking more healthier"
Clearly brighter is a gentle formula that enhances the appearance of skin. It is perfect for all skin types and does not irritate my sensitive skin. This product contains spf which protects someone's face from the harmful effects of the Suns rays. This product has caused a noticeable difference in the appearance and texture of my skin
"I was able to try new Garnier skin active clearly brighter brightening and smooth daily moisturizer twice a day. I applied it in the morning before make up and I applied it again at night after my shower. It's soaked in to my skin quickly and did not leave a greasy feeling. My only complaint would be after a couple of uses i began to break out on my cheeks which is unusual for me. Besides that though, my face felt hydrated and moisturized. I like how it has a subtle smell, not overwhelming."
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is one amazing thing - I was really amazed to see it working from day one, the smoothness it gave to my skin ... I couldn't believe and I had to continue to see the results and I am sold to this. I love it. My facial skin breaks out whenever I try new sun screen , but with this lotion , I could see that this lotion actually brightens as well as protects the skin."
"This product is my new moisturizer in my morning routine. I love that it's not oily and goes on very lightly. that was my main concern with it having SPF in it, i thought it would make my face white from the sunscreen. It goes on sheer and it protects my face from dangerous UV rays. I love it!"
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily moisturizer has proved its effectiveness in the 7- day Clearly Brighter Challenege! My skin was brighter, especially around my eyes and my chin area-around my mouth. My skin was definitely smoother as well. I also appreciate that it has SPF in the product because I do not have to worry about putting on a separate SPF when I am using this product. It really is an all-in-one product for me."
"This is my new favorite moisturizer. It is light but super hydrating. My skin feels healthier, looks healthier and I'm getting sun protection all from one product. It soaks in fairly quickly and doesn't leave you feeling like you have a ton of moisturizer on your face."
After I started using Garnier Clearly Brighter I started noticing a difference. My skin felt much smoother and it looked brighter. The smell of the product was also pleasing. I was also reassured seeing that the product is a sunscreen and that is very important to me.
I really enjoyed sampling Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. I felt it hydrated my skin and the Spf was a great added benefit. I dont know exactly how brighter my skin was compared to other moisturizers I have used. Never the less my skin felt good.
"This product is a lifesaver! My skin looks so much more hydrated. It's super moisturizing without being to greasy or thick. My skin also looks brighter and glowier. The added SPF helps me remember to protect my skin against sun damage. I'm not crazy about the smell, but it gets results!"
I don't use a daily moisturizer because they don't work. The Garnier Clearly Brighter does work though. It absorbs into my skin super fast and it helps keep my extremely dry face super soft. Did I also mention that it smells AMAZING. I love the light scent that's light enough to wear all day but not super strong so it doesn't give me headaches.
Love Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15! It not only made my pores smaller but also helped with the dullness and uneven skin tone of my facial skin. I also love and trust the product since it is made by Garnier who are the leading experts in the beauty industry .
"I was so happy that this moisturizer felt light, absorbed completely, and didn't leave any white cast on my skin or cause any breakouts. In fact, this moisturizer left my skin soft, hydrated with a nice healthy glow and I didn't get oily. This moisturizer doesn't have that heavy sunscreen smell. Perfect for spring-summer when I wear less makeup."
I finally found a moisturizer that I can use in the daytime that doesn't leave me looking oily or that breaks me out! This helped make my skin get a glow look! The scent smells like rose petals to me. I will be using use this as part of my morning regimen!
"This product is amazing, the spf is wonderful, the scent is delectable and this is the only product I have used that actually takes away my brown spots. I have had them for a few years now and this cream is slowly but surely making them disappear. It is my go to cream for day and night, I can't live without this and have noticed a brighter more youthful complexion in just the short time I have used it."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is fast absorbing, non-greasy, lightweight and has a lovely citrus-floral fresh and gentle scent. It did not cause any irritation or breakouts and my skin felt smoother and clearer in just a short period of time. I love I don't have to worry about applying sunscreen separately. It's perfect for spring and summer!"
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 was easy to apply and didn't leave a sticky residue. It felt like I didn't have anything on my face after I applied it, and it was nice knowing I was protected by the sun."
"Loving Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15!! My skin is looking a lot healthier! No longer dull and dark! I almost feel like I might even look a little younger! Perfect moisturizer if you are looking for protection, with out causing your skin to be an oily mess! Highly recommend"
I really enjoy this product. It makes my face visible brighter and softer. My face feels hydrated and it has a great scent. Very affordable and very creamy. Just took one week to see and feel the difference. I've gotten compliments that my skin is shiny and bright.
"I love garniers Clearly brighter sunscreen moisturizer. It helps improve skins radiance and after a week of using it, there is a noticeable improvement in the skins overall complexion. Garnier is a brand that has amazing products for an affordable price. I am very satisfied with clearly brighters results and I do recommend this product."
I found this to be a very effective moisturizer.My skin did feel smoother and not as rough in certain places after using it for a week.It does have a floral scent that isn't too over powering.I like how it soaks into my skin and doesn't feel greasy.I use this on my face and hands and it works very well.
"I absolutely love this product! I have to admit I was quite skeptical about seeing a difference in just one week, however I did notice quite the difference. My skin is softer, more radiant and glowing, I've seen a reduction in fine lines around my eyes and mouth, and my once blotchy skintone is more even. This is definitely a product that I will continue to use, because it works!"
I was very pleased with Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It smoothed my skin and had a very pleasant scent. I have very sensitive skin so was very excited it did not cause me to breakout. The only reason I rated 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is a little thinner then I prefer. It does however rub in smooth and does not leave a greasy feel to your skin.
"I loved this product! The cream is so light and is absorbed quickly. It doesn't leave a greasy feeling and I have no worries about applying my makeup shortly after putting it on. My skin has already received compliments for looking brighter, and it has made my skin so soft. The only thing stopping me from giving this 5 stars is that my skin tone is still slightly uneven in some spaces after only using it a week. I'll keep using it to see what happens, but so far I like the results!"
"I'm loving the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with spf 15. Several skincare benefits in one bottle. It's Hydrating but not heavy. It goes on white and sinks in my skin leaving my face soft. I've noticed my complexion is brighter, a lit from within type of glow. My skin texture has improved and all after the 7 day challenge. I will continue to use this to see the full results, but after 7 days I'm a true fan of Garnier!"
"Skin does look brighter - glowing after using Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter SPF 15 Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. I like that it solves many needs at once: daily SPF, brightens, smoothes fine lines, and moisturizes. The only shortfall for me is I prefer organic products that are free of harsh ingredients and are natural."
"I love Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. Not only do I have healthier looking skin,my skin looks so shiny. I can tell a big difference every day. I usually use makeup to cover my face but now with Garnier SkinActive no need to. My skin is so much softer."
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a product is fast absorbing, non-greasy on my skin with a light delicate smell (which smells really nice too) , but finally that it turns dull or rough skin into smooth skin like a baby's bottom with a more radiant and even tone. All from one product you can't go wrong with that!"
"I was very pleased with how it left my face feeling smooth, and brighter! The ingredients were easy to understand! It also SPF15 in it so I know its protecting my face at the same time as its moisturizing! The scent is light and I also found you only need a little bit to cover your face! I have passed out a few of my samples to some co workers, and friends! So far they loved it too!"
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is great. It has a light scent that doesn't irritate the sensitive noses out there so you can get a fresh feeling face WITH A SCENT. Plus it has a little SPF but you DON'T smell it which is not the case with others I've tried. A must buy for every face type.
"I was skeptical at first usually if things seem to God to be trite they are. But not in this case, my face is moisturized not oily. It also took away some of my sun spots aka freckles. It works wonders on keeping an even skin tone. I am happy with my results. All of my friend will know how well this product works."
"Garnier is quickly becoming my favorite product. This stuff is fantasist. It absorbed quickly, refreshed my skin and was light and airy. My skin felt beautiful, protected and glowing. It was not greasy like some other products. It's now a staple in my beauty routine.I received this product free to review as a part of the Garnier Crowdtap crowd. These thoughts are of my own and not swayed"
"I really enjoyed trying this moisturizer out it makes my skin feel nice and smooth and brighter. I like the way that it does not smell like sunscreen like alot of other moisturizers that have spf in them, it actually has a very light pleasant smell to it that goes away pretty quickly. I received this product complimentary to try and share my opinions and these are my honest and true opinions."
My skin is so radiant and glowing after using this product for just 10 days! It is more even-toned and I have even noticed that my fine wrinkles have begun to fade! Amazing results! I highly recommend this product.I received a free sample for testing purposes.
"I absolutely fell in love with this product from my first try. after washing my face i would apply this moisturizer and i cant tell you how incredibly soft, healthy, glowing, and refreshing my face looked afterwards. definitely worth the purchase 10-10 recommend. and IT SMELLS GREAT"
"While using Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 twice a day for over a week now, I must say I love my results so far. Smooth skin that is noticeably Brighter with such a Healthy glow. A little bit goes a long way, absorbs nicely into skin without leaving it greasy or oily, which is great for under make up. The best part is the SPF Sun protection, can't beat that while hydrating my skin. Thanks #CrowdTap for the chance to try #Complimentary."
I am really impressed with Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily. I know I need to use SPF and found the product enjoyable to use as it doesn't smell like SPF. I love that my large pores looked smoother and less noticeable and I like that my skin looks brighter. No oily skin in the afternoon either.
"I'm super picky on sunscreen products because I hate that chemical smell, Garnier Skinactive Daily Moisturizer has a light citrus scent. The lotion is really light so you don't feel greasy and a lil really goes along way. As for the brighter skin and even skin tone, I really can't tell any changes, maybe with more time using it? I would totally continue to use this product as a sunscreen"
"I really liked Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter. The formula was not greasy. It went right into my skin. It left my skin looking healthy and youthful. I love how it glows and evens out. The smell was a little bit strong for me. I liked the smell, but would have taken it down one notch. My husband wouldn't use it because of the scent."
"Very impressed! If you like the Simple Rich Lotion and-or like light, non greasy everyday moisturizers then you will LOVE this. It also has the added benefit of SPF 15 to protect your skin from the sun. I noticed that the texture of my skin is slowly getting smoother also so I would love to see what the long term results are. It is the perfect every day moisturizer and every woman should have this in their routine"
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is so effective and convenient to use. I love having one bottle and one less step in the morning. I no longer need to apply sunscreen before I head out the door. After one week I did notice that my face looked smoother and brighter. The scent is very pleasant and not too overpowering. I would recommend this product.
"Another great product from Garnier! I love this moisturizer! It is so easy to get it to absorb into my skin and it leaves my skin feeling so soft and looking and feeling very smooth and evens out my skin tone. I love that it has an SPF and even though I typically don't like products that include that b-c of the way that it smells and it often irritates my skin, I didn't have any problems with this moisturizer."
"I am always skeptical of new facial moisturizers, but I noticed a difference in my skin within 3 days of using the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer spf 15. The redness, dryness, and unpredictable behavior of my facial skin was gone! I have been looking for a daily moisturizer that would work and not leave me feeling dry and lacking midday; a moisturizer that would make me feel like my overall skin tone was brighter and healthier. I am hooked!"
"After taking the 7-day challenge, I found that this moisturizer didn't clog my pores and felt lightweight when applying it. It absorbed very quickly and kept my skin fresh and moisturized all day long. I gave this product a 3 for the fact that I don't feel it will reduce or diminish fine lines or wrinkles, which is something that I am more interested in."
I love how soft my skin feels after using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I no longer notice the dry flaking skin that I battle every winter. With the help of the SPF15 protection built in I feel protected against the winter & spring sun. My skin actually feels younger with more elasticity & tone. Loving my new skin moisturizer!
I enjoyed using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Beightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. It has a nice floral fragrance to it. It goes on nice and even. I really like that it has SPF in it so I am confidant to go outside when it is nice and sunny and know my face is protected. I'm not how well it brightened or smoothed out my face but my face does look good after using it which makes me happy.
"After using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15, I noticed a different in my skin right away. It seemed it smooth out areas that areas that I have problems with, as I am aging. It seemed to fill in some of the fine lines. It also help my skin to feel hydrated throughout the day. I really liked this new product and plan to make it a routine everyday."
After taking the Clearly Brighter Challenge I was very happy with the way my skin looked. It felt smooth and soft! I love how my skin felt bright with the tiniest bit of glow. Not only did I love how my skin felt but I also loved how it had SPF15. I am really bad when it comes to sunscreen when out and about doing daily activities. I like knowing that my moisturizer has a sunscreen built in!
I like how LIGHT this moisturizer is! It does not feel greasy at all! Many moisturizers with SPF have a heavy feel and make my skin feel like it is a dirt magnet. Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer absorbs quickly. It saves me time not having to apply both an SPF and a moisturizer. I feel good knowing my skin is protected and nourished! ‪‪‪
"I really like the texture of the product. It is not greasy but also doesn't require a lot of product to provide moisture. It creates noticeable brighter skin the more you use it. I haven't had a chance to test the SPF in the bright sun, but I have noticed this product protects against the elements (like harsh wind). I have very dry skin and this product left it feeling firm and very smooth. I received this product for free for testing purposes from Allure Magazine."
"I have extremely dry eczema ridden skin and having this clearly brighter by garnier moisturizer in a sample size has been a lifesaver ! There are days that my skin gets to dry, flaky and itchy that I can't focus on anything else and most other products just irritate my skin further.While I wil not claim this product has healed my eczema because it was never intended to do so, nor is my eczema gone, it does help tremendously to moisturize my facial skin."
I really enjoy this product. I love the way it smells and that it has sun screen in it. I live in Florida and the sun is hard on my skin. I have not been one to really take care of my skin till recently. These small sample bottles have been easy to keep in my car and when I stop at a red light I have been applying it. So far my skin is moisturized and I am really loving the product.
"I have used Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer for the past 2-3 weeks. I have noticed immediate and long term results. My skin of my face and neck are smooth, clear, and feel and look healthy. My husband and family have all noticed the changes. This product has been a lifesaver- my face has new life and looks vibrant again! Would definitely recommend!"
I absolutely love the Garnier Skinactive Cleary Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF15. I feel after a week of using it everyday before I put my makeup on that it makes my face glow. It looks healthy and thriving. I can say my face before using this did not have that feature. I finally found a product I can put into routine and enjoy.
"While I'm not tooooo picky about my moisturizer, I've been super impressed with the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer - I love the benefits it brings to the table in addition to just bring a moisturizer. It's not too oily-greasy throughout the day which I've noticed is an issue with some other moisturizers I've used, so that is definitely good!! I'm very happy with this moisturizer, and will continue using it for the foreseeable future!"
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a great product. I took the challenge and put it on my face, neck, and chest for a week. Not only did I notice a definite difference, people around me also noticed. My skin is smooth, soft, and has a certain glow to it. I absoulutely love this product and will continue to use it everyday. I strongly recommend to take the challenge for a week, you won't be sorry."
"This moisturizer feels light and fresh on your skin which is great because I don't like a heavy moisturizer. My skin was brighter and smoother after only a week of wearing it. I get sun protection from the SPF. My only complaint is that I don't like the smell very much. That's just personal preference though. All in all, a very good product that does what it claims."
"I want to give this 5 stars but cannot since I've only had 1 week to test it out. It can take up to 30+ days to see the full effects of products. Since I've been using the product I have noticed a change in my skin's texture and have noticed a slight difference in it tone & brightness. Once I have used it for a full 30 days I will be able to provide a more detailed review. The product is not sticky nor greasy, and absorbs fast. The trial size is also perfect for the gym & traveling."
"I enjoyed using the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moistruizer with SPF15. While it absorbed very well and seem to do well on my skin, I did notice a slightly pilling effect a bit after applying it. When rubbing the face you get a slight texture off of it from the moistruizer, otherwise am completely happy with this product."
I love how this feels on my skin my skin has never been this soft in a long while. No more dry skin it was bad with winter and now i am feeling back alive again. I will be recommending this to anyone that has had dry skin this winter plus it has spf thats a double plus-
Before trying Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer I had dry patches of skin on the skins of my nose and in between my eyebrows. It was embarrassing. My face was red and it was hard for makeup to cover it. But after just a couple of applications I started noticing the dry skin not look so red and within a few days no more red dry patchy skin. My face is smooth and looks so much better.
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is great for helping my uneven skin to even out. I have always had dry patches on my face and with this it moisturizes the spots without being oily, which is great. I also like the fact that it has an spf15 in it because I am always needing sunscreen to keep my fair skin from burning. I am so glad I was able to sample this product for free and will be buying it in the future."
I have sensitive skin and some products do not work with it because of this. I also have redness on my face so some products make that worse instead of better. But with Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 did not do any of those things. It made my skin better and smoother without irritating it. It made it moisturized and made it feel great. It also made it look great too!
When I first used this I felt wow..it's so very non greasy and there was instant brightening of my skin. My skin started to feel softer than ever. I had a uneven tone earlier.with the use of this brightening cream I feel my skin tone has also evened out
"I love Garnier SkinActive moisturizer because goes smoothly on my skin! My skin does not feel shiny and is perfect for under makeup moisturizer. I really love its fragance, smells soo good! Perfect for outdoors activities because it has SPF 15! My skin feels like glowing :) Thank you so much Garnier!"
I really liked how this version did not make my eyes red or sting like others have. It's great to be able to cleanse and moisturize in two easy steps. The scent is nice and light and it goes on smooth and easy it's not greasy or heavy it absorbs right into your skin. You should differently give it the full seven day trial you won't be disappointed.
I could not be any happier with Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. My skin feels amazing. My skin feels soft and smooth. It feels healthy and vibrant. I have dry skin and this moisturizer has left my skin feeling refreshed.
This is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used! I use it in the morning before I apply make up and I can tell a big difference in the brightness of my skin. This is also a great moisturizer that is lighter in nature and not too heavy so I felt my skin could breathe well before applying my primer and foundation. I have been reccommending this to family and friends.
I love the new Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I love how well it makes my skin look and feel. I have notices that my face not only looks brighter but it has also started to even out my skin tone. With more uses I can see my skin getting better and better. Your face is left moisturized and not feeling oily or sticky at all. I would recommend this product to anyone that is looking for better brighter looking skin.
"The Garniera SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is super impressive. I have a very hard time finding moisturizers that I like and that work for me, but this one would definitely be a go-to product! My skin felt smoother, looked brighter, and had an overall better appearance and feel after using this moisturizer. I also didn't get any breakouts from using this moisturizer like I do from most other moisturizers. I would definitely recommend this moisturizer!"
This is a great moisturizer. My face feels really smooth and clean. Everytime I applied it to my face there's a fresh and cool feeling that I love. And one thing is awesome about this product It smells really good. I loved it. I will definitely will purchase more.
"Overall, I like this product, but I'm not sure that it's moisturizing enough for me. I have pretty dry skin and I need something more heavy duty than this for a day to day. If you didn't have dry skin I think it would be a good option. I like that it has SPF in it as well."
"The skinactive clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf 15 by garnier is really nice. It's a light moisturizer that absorbs quickly into my skin and leaves it looking nice and healthy. It gives my skin a wonderful glow. It's not greasy at all either. It has spf 15, which will make it nice to use all year round. It does leave my a little irritated, but most products do until my skin gets used to it. It's still a nice moisturizer."
"Who doesn't love to kill 2 birds with 1 stone? I adore dynamic duo of sunscreen and moisturizing in Garnier's Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizing. My face felt nice and refreshed which is great because when I wake up, I like to apply moisturizer and since it also has sunscreen, I don't have to worry about protecting my face! The smell was also very fresh and smelled like spring which I loved."
5 star Rating!Love this Moisturizer! It absorbs very quickly. It doesnt leave a heavy sticky or goopy residue on your face. It has a nice and light smelling scent. It works and leaves your skin looking and feeling great within a matter of just a few days. I have recommended and shared with family and friends. I will be using this from now on! :)
"I love the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I have issues with dry skin because I live at altitude in CO, and as a pale person who likes to run, I'm always looking for new ways to protect my skin. This moisturizer is the ideal solution, and works fantastically! I've seen such great results, and will definitely keep using it in the future!"

"I am very hard to please, especially with moisturizers. I actually really like this one and plan to use it in the future. It made my face very soft, hydrated, and believe it or not, I saw a change in my complexion in about a week. It actually brightened it up some and smoothed it out. Very nice product."
"This moisturizer is okay, its not my favorite but i like it. I do love that it makes your face matte but it gives you a subtle glow. The only thing that I do not like is that it does make your face as moisturized as I would like. The smell is also a little strong for a face moisturizer."
"Not only does this product brighten my skin , it also has SPF 15. Sunscreen is very important to wear always. This product went on easy without leaving a greasy feeling on my skin. This is a great product and I have recommend it to lots of my friends already."
"Immediately after first applying Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15, I noticed a dramatic appearance in the brightness of my skin. I've tried other products that claim to brighten your skin, but none had the immediate effect of this.This goes on light, doesn't feel greasy, and has a light invigorating scent. It works well under makeup or alone, and the SPF factor is an added bonus. I'm a runner, and I've yet to receive a sunburn while wearing this product outside."
I enjoyed sampling Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Moisturizer. I love how light the moisturizer is- it's the perfect thickness for the warmer spring and summer months when I don't want a heavy cream moisturizer. I also enjoyed how soft and smooth it left my skin- I could feel a difference the first time I tried it. It was easy to apply with no heavy fragrance or coloring- I'm def happy with the sample and plan to buy more.
I thought the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 was so great! I had positive result after ONE week! My face felt so smooth and light. I love anything that my skin loves and my skin felt fresh and happy! I love using the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15!
"I received a free sample of Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 from Crowdtap and boy am I glad I did! Otherwise, I never would have found out what a fantastic product this is. In just one week this light and refreshing moisturizer made my skin brighter, more even and looking younger than other products that I have tried that cost twice or even three or four times as much. Give it a try and see for yourself what a difference it can make in just 1 week!!"
"This is a great product that is less expensive than high end store brands, but works even better. It is very light on my skin, did not cause any breakouts, and really made my skin tone look even and much brighter. This is an all time favorite and I will continue to buy."
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 worked great on my skin! I loved how rich the product is-- I was able to use half the amount I normally use. My skin stayed smooth and bright all day long. Will definitely purchase in the future! #samplereview

"My new favorite thing about Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is that it REALLY WORKS! My face is smooth now, with no rough patches of dry skin. My skin is tighter and brighter than it was a week ago. I don't have to apply as much concealer to my face to try to even out the dark blotches. It's really easy to apply and doesn't take a lot of product! Then you add in the SPF 15 that I can normally never remember to use but it's already in it! Super easy to use"
"I loved this lotion. I love that it contains SPF and is very lightweight. I was surprised how quickly my skin looked brighter and on days I didn't use it, I could tell my skin wasn't as soft and was a bit rough. I love that it didn't make me feel oily and was a joy to use."
I love the new Garnier SkinAvtive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily moisturizer. My skin looks brighter. My co workers have asked if I tanned or changed make up they could see a change. I enjoy the smell of it and its lightness when it goes on .I think its a great product. I have enjoyed it as well as my friends I shared with .
"I live in a state that is cold 60% of the year. The skin on my face is often dry and rough. After using this moisturizer though, my skin was so soft! I love how supple my face felt. My skin just looked healthier overall. And I love that it offers protection from the sun as well!"
"After taking the Clearly Brighter Challenge, I'm definitely going to be continuing to use Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer! I love that it moisturizes well and provides some sun protection. I have noticed a difference in my skin. It definitely doesn't seem as dull as it did before I started using the moisturizer. I'm hoping with continued use to see more changes in my skin."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is really great at giving your skin that added layer of extra protection needed from long hour s of exposure to the sun and the elements. It never feels greasy or sticky, it just leaves your skin soft and smooth."
"This moisturizer is so light weight and perfect for wearing every day with or without makeup. As a women with oily skin, I can tell you that after using other moisturizers and other sunscreens in the past, this one has set the bar. It leaves my skin feeling fresh, not oily and ready for my day. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs a lightweight daily moisturizer. Plus the SPF is a huge plus so that you do not have to double up on products."
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 was very nice on the skin. Wasn't heavy or greasy and made it easy with the added SPF to not worry about going out in the sun. I would give it 5 stars but the scent was to much. I would've prefered unscented or something milder.
It didn't break me out or gave me a oily face. I like it. I would definitely save some for summer when I do go outside. I will be needing it alot this summer. It did give me nice looking skin. I used it under my makeup and it didn't look oily at all. Definitely a good moisturizer.
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 began brightening my skin and felt really smooth and moisturized as soon as I started using it. I love that it has sunscreen in it so I won't forget. It had really helped my skin look more glowing, softer, and moisturized which is a feat in the dry hot desert air where I live."
"I really appreciated the SPF contained in the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer, but it left my skin shiny and looking greasy. I also noticed a few pimples started to form on my face after just a few days of use. If you have less oily skin, this would probably be a great moisturizer for you! It applied easily and did not leave white streaks on your face. And you can't beat protecting yourself from the sun!"
"The Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF15 is now an essential part of my morning routine. It has a wonderful yet soft scent and keeps my face smooth all day. Many moisturizers make my face feel oily, but not Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily moisturizer."
"I love Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter. My face has been noticeably smoother and brighter since using it, so much healthier looking. It has broad spectrum spf 15, so it protects my skin all day, plus it has moisturizer so no dry faces. SkinActive contains antioxidant complex Vitamin C + LHA, and it's oil free."
"Using it on a daily basis makes this product work amazingly. Using it in the morning before applying makeup and in the evening before bed. My skin is nice and smooth, not left greasy. No additional blemishes and ones that were there have been removed! This product is amazing and certainly works! Its a great product for a great price! Everyone should take the challenge!"
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 makes my skin feel so silky smooth. I put it on in the morning and after I was my face at night and my skin feels so hydrated, soft, and smooth. It's alight formula so it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily at all. I love that it has sunscreen in it so it helps prevent from the damaging rays of the sun especially since I'm bad with using sunscreen often. I will definitely use this product again in a heart beat."
"Overall, I liked this product. It went on smooth and did not leave a greasy or oily residue. It was absorbed easily by my skin. It did not leave white streaks like other sunscreens usually do. I felt that my skin was brighter and looked radiant after using it for a week. It had a nice light smell to it. I liked the soft scent it had as well. The only thing is that I didn't feel like it lasted all day, my skin got dry again around half-day and I would re-apply. But other than that, it is a great product."
"this product it's really amazing. I used it for 10 day to make sure I share a truly feedback and I had time enough to note that it's like a medicine for skin. Now I feel my skin, brighter, silky, healthy and smooth. The best it's I can be protected of sun and beautiful at the same time."
"This is a great product for the price. Most moisturizers of this quality are over 20 dollars, so this looks like it retails for 14.99. Which is a great deal. Smells lovely, is light going on and not oily at all. The SPF 15 makes it great to use all spring and summer to keep my skin looking bright and healthy."
"I love this product and definitely plan on keeping this in my daily routine. I like that the product is not heavily scented, is not greasy or heavy and very silky when applied.A little of the product goes a long way which makes it easy to get full face and neck coverage with little effort. I'd definitely get my moneys worth purchasing outside of this sample mission."
"I love the feeling of Garnier Skinactive Cleary Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer! My skin feels hydrated right away and my skin keeps looking bright all day long. It ha a mild scent, which is nice. I especially love that it has SPF 15 so that I am protected too! This is really important to me while living in Florida. I would definitely purchase this for everyday use. Only downside is the name of the product is too long :)"
"I love the Garnier* products, the Garnier* Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 is amazing, my skin really looks clearly, soft to touch, non greasy, with my make up is wonderful. This is my favorite moisturizer and don't think that I gonna change my mind."
"As a member of Crowdtap I had the pleasure of receiving a sample of Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 and give my honest feedback on. I was really excited and happy to try this product. It has a light citrus pleasant smell. It absorbs into my skin easily and moisturizes without making my skin feel greasy. The texture is nice and thick and does not pull on my skin when spreading on face. Overall, this seems a good moisturizer and I'll continue to use."
"I love the Garnier Clearly Brightener. It feels amazing and leaves my face feeling amazing, no greasy residue, smells good. I like that the product has sunscreen in it that is great for my face. Those dark circles under my eyes are so much lighter now. This is a great product."
"I liked how it made my skin feel. It feels soft and smooth without feeling sticky. Sometimes with other brands you can tell that it has sunscreen, but you can't with this one. I wish it didn't have avobenzene in it though because I have rosacea and so I shouldn't wear this."
"One of the best products I have tried lately! I tend to break out easily and hate oily moisturizers! So when I used this and did not break out, plus is not oily and it works!! My skin is much brighter and smoother! This will be part of my daily routine from now on!! :-)"
"I was excited to try this Garnier SkinActive Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer because I have acne scars, freckles and sun spots, basically some uneven skintones. I was hoping to love this moisturizer, that it would do wonders for me but that is not the case. I will start with what I do like about this moisturizer, it is non greasy, oil free, thick but spreads and absorbs nicely and it did lighten some of my spots."
"I've tried many different moisturizers and been disappointed by the results, so I was skeptical when I started the Clearly Brighter Challenge. Within one week I saw brighter skin and more even skin tone. My skin looked more radiant and I was receiving compliments about how clear and smooth my skin looked. This is my new go to moisturizer, you've gained a loyal customer!"
"I was highly impressed with Garnier clearly brighter moisturizer. I love how it smells, the formula, its effectiveness and its versatility. I did see slight improveness in my skin. It looked brighter and refreshed. Not dull. The best feature I like is that it does multiple things. It moisturizes, brightens, and protects your skin. I would recommend this product."
After using this product for the past seven days I am pleased with the results.This product goes on my skin smoothly and does not make my skin feel greasy like some facial products has done in the past.I think my skin looks brighter and am pleased that it has the SPF15 sunscreen so that I know that I have some protection when I go out.
I would definitely purchase Garnier SkinActive Brighter Brightening moisturizer. It goes onto my skin smooth and leaves no residue. I love that it gets absorbed very quickly. It has a great scent and isn't greasy at all. I will keep using it to see if my skin gets brighter for summer.
My favorite thing is that my skin feel so hydrated after i apply it!! It make my skin look healthier and smooth!! Before garnier clearly brighter my skin was opaque and with a lot of imperfections and after one week using it its completely shocking how beautiful my skin looks now. I love that it does not have a strong smell it actually smell so delicate for a skin.I highly recomend it!
"I really like this new product. It is very smooth, and gentle on my skin. Absorbs quickly into the skin. It also has a very pleasant scent. The fact that it has a SPF of 15 is a bonus! I'm usually very particular about my facial products, but I will be using this one from how on!"
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brighting and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is great! I have had issues with my skin being rough and dull. I have used this product for a week and I can not even believe the difference. my skin is so soft even my husband noticed!!
"At first I was a little skeptical, I wasn't sure how this would stand up against my $50 daily mousturizer. But... I am actually blown away! This mousturizer has made my skin so smooth and soft and glowing! I love that it has spf in it too for extra protection. I have finally found the perfect daily mousturizer and I don't have to pay an arm and a leg for it, thanks Garnier!"
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is the best lotion and sunscreen combo that I have tried for my face. I saw results in just one week!! My skin was smoother, softer and looked more evenly toned. I was surprised by the light weight feel of the lotion on my skin, in the past most moisturizers I've tried feel heavy and oily on my skin. I will recommend this all everyone. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review."
After usuing this product I now have the confidence to not even wear makeup. My face is clean and beautiful. I love being able to have a product that has an SPF in it being I have very pale skin. The only problem I found was even when it said oil-free I still felt like my skin was a little oily after using but it never beoke my face out which was huge as I have very sensitive skin.
"I was a little skeptical at first, but after using the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 for a week, i was quite pleased with the results. My skin does look bright, and a lot smoother as well. I like the way my skin looks and feels and it's nice that it also has SPF15."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is now one of the biggest 'must' haves in my house. I wasn't expecting it to really make my skin brighter, I was just hoping to take care of the dry spots around my nose and chin, but I am telling you, my skin is brighter. My make-up has went on smoother the past week (since I started using Garnier) then it EVER has. It leaves behind no oily residue. I would definitely recommend it. I already bought a full size bottle!"
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF15 is becoming a standard in my beauty regimen. I love the way it makes my skin look and feel and I love that it is SPF 15. In Arizona, not wearing sun protection on a daily basis can quickly lead to skin cancer. All my skin products must have it."
I am in love with Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer! My biggest love with this little gem is the fact that it has the built in SPF15.I have a huge problem with forgetting to put on sunscreen when I am heading out. This product allows me to have it built in so I'll be protected without having to add in another product to do so!
"This clearly brighter challenge was amazing! I would suggest this product to everyone. My skin became brighter looking, clearer looking and protected me for the sun with SPF Protection! I love this and will never use any other product again, a must have!"
The garnier skin active clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf is amazing. it really brightened my skin and made it smooth. I love the way it kept my skin feeling moisturized and it had a great smell to it. the smell was very subtle and not overpowering. i will definitely continue to use this moisturizer after the great results i have received from using it daily
Garnier Clearly Brighter makes your skin feel smooth and absorbs easily. I personally did notice a difference in my completion. I was found the scent a bit too heavy for my taste. Overall as a moisturizer it did a good job so I would recommend it based on that fact.
I really liked this Garnier Brightening moisturizer because it isn't sticky and has SPF15 in it. Those are the main two things that I look for in a good moisturizer for myself or one that I would recommend. I also noticed visibly brighter skin on my face and hands!
"I love Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I have been using it for a week now, and my face is a lot softer and smoother. I love the scent too. Lots of others don't smell as good and a great smell is important because after putting it on, that's all you smell for a little while."
I enjoyed my Garnier SkinActive because of the soothing effect it gave my face and protection it provided my face from UV rays. Overall it was a good addition to my morning routine but the only thing is that at times it left my skin a little flaky. I did really like the SPF protection because it was just something extra that I don't usually think about.
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is amazing! It feels so light on your skin. The fresh scent is an added bonus. It is a great moisturizer. Fights dry skin well. Has a good amount of SPF at 15! I definitely use this daily!
"I like this product because it's not just a moisturizer but it also protects you skin from the sun with the SPF 15. The scent is so light that you never would have to worry about it clashing with any perfume you might be wearing. This product just helps your skin look it's best. Your skin will be smoother, softer, brighter, and just look much healthier.I received this product free through CrowdTap-Garnier to try out than write a honest unbiased review."
I loved this moisturizer. I think that clearer and brighter skin can be seen within a few days of using this product. It absorbs onto the skin quickly which makes mornings a breeze. SPF 15 is great but I would like a little bit higher SPF. I enjoy how little product it takes to cover the entire fact which makes the product last for a really long time. I would appreciate a pump that gives out the right amount of productive because I usually end up squeezing out too much but that's more of a preference.
"I loved Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15! It was an amazing daytime moisturizer for under my makeup, with just enough SPF to protect but to make my skin stay fresh and not sticky feeling! I also loved the scent - some face lotions smell so funky, but this one had just enough scent to cover any funkiness but not make me feel like I'm putting perfume on my face. I would definitely continue to buy this product!"
I overall enjoyed using this product. I love that it instantly brightens and smooths your skin as well as brightens and smooths your skin over time. My skin also felt very moisturized after using it. I did not enjoy the sent of this product. It has a perfume-sunscreen scent that lingers for two hours application. If I licked my lips and my tongue touched my skin I could taste it.
"I really loved how smoothing this product was. My skin did look visable brighter and polished looking after use. The scent was minimal, not overpowering and I really loved that the SPF was high enough for summertime use. I am always weary of skin lotions that will still burn my skin but this one shouldn't, its perfect for spending all day in the sun and still getting the protection that I need."
"I really loved Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It had a pleasant (not overpowering) scent and was gentle on my skin. Normally, I break out when I try new face products, but this one left my skin clear. I was most surprised by how it evened out my skin tone, leaving my face polished and radiant. My skin seemed smoother, softer, brighter, and I think a few wrinkles disappeared! I'll definitely be buying this in the future and recommending it to others."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is overall an ok product, perhaps it takes time to get used to. For the first few days it honestly broke me out a bit, and has a strong, sharp smell to it. After several days my skin calmed down and I've gotten used to it, it works ok with my skin, perhaps for others it would be better."
"Not to shabby, I'm loving the scent and the feel of my face, feels smooth and improved texture, in fact I noticed a difference right away from first use how my skin felt smooth and more evened texture. Works great under my make up and I'm glad it has SPF 15. I'm fairly pale so I cannot comment one the brightning effect. I forsure will continue to use and it has not broken me out or anything and feels great."
"I love Garnier Clearly Brighter Moisturizer!!! I was a little skeptical about how well it would work, but now I'm a believer! It has a nice scent, is easy to use, protects against the sun, and clears up skin deficiencies. I gave away samples and all of the friends that tried it absolutely loved it too!"
"Tried the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 and absolutely love it! Easy to apply and leaves your skin brighter and smoother. Leaves skin feeling great and doesn't have the ""heavy"" feeling that some other products do."
I really love using Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer! I love that it's an amazing moisturizer that's also a sunscreen. It's also nice that this moisturizer is oil free and contains vitamin C. It feels great on my skin and it doesn't make my skin feel oily or dirty at all! I love this product.
I tried this daily for about 10 days and my skin really looked younger and felt so soft. There was no oily feeling and heaviness left on my skin like some other products. The fact that it's a sunscreen is a huge plus. No more using several products to achieve what this Garnier skin active clearly brighter does. It has a nice light floral scent that not overpowering. That's a big plus.
I have nothing bad to say about this product. I absolutely love this product so so much that I can't wait to purchase the full size product. It cleared up my acne scarring pretty good but I know that by using it for a couple of months more it will definitely clear my scarring. It helped even out my skin texture which is amazing.
Clearly brighter is a sunscreen based cream used to brighten and smooth the skin. This product left my skin soft and looking brighter and fresh. It didn't leave an oily finish or cause any breakouts or irritation. I really like how it doesn't leave my skin oily and it can be used as a daily moisturizer
"I'm not sure I noticed my skin get much brighter, but it did have a nice glow to it after I applied the lotion. My skin definitely feels the same, but I always appreciate a facial lotion with SPF right in it. The more sun protection I can get, the better. Overall, I'll continue to use it and see what happens. I wonder if there was a nightly product that I could add to this to make it more effective as my night cream isn't necessarily for the same results."
I was very impressed with Garnier Clearly Brighter daily moisturizer with SPF15. I have been using the same moisturizer for years. It was okay but didn't seem to really make my skin shine. I was basically using it for the SPF so I was glad to see a great product from Garnier that has SPF for your face. I have to wear SPF everyday all year so this is very important to me. I love the light scent and how my skin felt after using it. I used it for a week everyday and my skin seem to shine more and more. I love the way my skin looks.
"I recently took the 7 day Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer challenge. My skin is hydrated, no breakouts, the texture of my skin is great and my skin looks brighter and healthier. I am a true fan and will be looking into more Garnier skin care products after trying this."
"I finally have a product that I beyond love! My skin feels amazing and looks better than ever! There isn't a tacky feel left beyond and it smells so good! Generally I always end up breaking out from using lotion like stuff on my face, but not with this product! Not only does it protect skin, it is super gentle!"
This is an awesome product. It doesnt leave my face feeling gross after a long day. Makes my skin feel soft and looks even toned.The scent isnt strong it does smell good but I would love an unscented version of this. I usually use a bb cream but I love this for the days i want a more natural look. My skin is very sensitive and this doesnt affect its sensitivity at all
"I really liked Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It is light enough to wear under makeup and it does not leave a greasy film on my skin. After using the product for 7 days, I noticed a visibly brighter and smoother complexion. I also like it's very affordable! I would use this product over and over again."
"This moisturizer goes on light with a gentle, pleasant scent. It has good coverage with only a little bit. It makes claims for brighter looking skin and a more even skin tone,.I can say that it's one of the only moisturizers with SPF that makes the skin on my face soft and smooth and it wears well under my BB cream."
"After a week I can already see improvement in my skin! My complexion looks more even-toned and smooth, and my makeup seems to be going on more evenly. The dry patches I had a week ago are gone, but my skin is not over-moisturized. ""Brightening"" is the perfect word for this moisturizer; my skin has a glow! Amazing!!"
"I completed the Garnier Clearly brighter 7 day challenge. I love having a daily SPF that is so lightweight and absorbs so quickly. If this moisturizer just did that it would be enough. But it also has the added benefit to brighten and smooth your face in ways I have yet to figure out. This did not stop me from breaking out during my one week a month that acne is an issue for me, which overlapped half of my 7 day challenge."
I love the garnier clearly brighter since I started using it a week ago the dark circles around my eyes have lightened up and my skin tone looks more even and smooth. I know it has sunscreen in it I dislike the smell but it's easy to get over with the results I've gotten.
"I really enjoyed using this moisturizer because it gives your face this radiant glow! Not only that but I love how refreshing your face feels when you apply it. Because it already has SPF (sunscreen), it saves me time from having to apply sunscreen and moisturizer separately and protects me from the sun's harmful rays. The texture is perfect and glides on the face very easily. I definitely recommend trying out this product."
I adore this moisturizer! It left my skin feeling soft and smooth. There wasn't any greasy residue left behind and I felt my really dry skin looked visibly better! The sunscreen put me to ease because I knew I was not only moisturizing but protecting myself from the sun as well!!! This is my new go to!
"I like garnier skin active clearly brighter brightening &smoothing daily moisturizer. With Every day use I see that my face is no longer dry and flaky. However; its too perfumy which irritates my skin, its better if they made this non scented and the name of the product us too long. Over all its a good moisturizer. #IGotItFree"
I really like this moisturizer! It made my skin look glowing and evened out my skin texture. It has a nice scent but wish it wasn't as strong. It does a good job moisturizing but my chin area seemed to get dryer the more I used this. Overall this is a good product and ill buy it in the future!
"I enjoyed using the product but am not likely going to switch from my current facial moisturizers as i see not difference after 2 weeks of use. I also did not love that there was a scent to the moisturizer, I prefer mine scent free. But, if i can not find my current moisturizer, this will be the one I pick up to use as my favorite back-up."
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brighening & Smoothing Daily moisturizer is the perfect product for spring. It gives me the broad spectrum protection that I need without feeling heavy or greasy on my skin. I use it every day and have enjoyed the way it has brightened and moisturized my skin. I will definitely be picking up some more.
"I am really loving this Garnier clearly brighter sunscreen! It does many things for your skin like brighten, smooth, moisturize, and protect. It's so simple just apply daily and more when your going into the sun. It's a great sunscreen. After my first week of using it my face was ""Clearly Brighter"". My face was bright and super soft! Love this stuff and it smells great! I received a free sample asba promotion to try it out and review it."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is wonderful! It has this light scent when applying it. Application doesn't leave your face greasy or clog pores. I'm not sure about my skin being brighter and smoother, but I definitely like this product as a moisturizer! I will use it again!"
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer has a nice citrus, floral fresh smell to it. It has the consistency of a mid-weight facial cream, yet it absorbs quickly into my skin. I used this under my makeup without any issues. I like that it has SPF15. Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is very moisturizing. It does keep my skin nice, soft and shine-free. Even better, it never caused my skin to breakout with acne!"
"I really enjoyed trying the Garnier Truly Brighter moisturizer. It was gentle on my skin, and left it feeling hydrated and soft. It didn't make my skin breakout, and I noticed my skin looked brighter in just one week. I had a healthy glow that I had been lacking before. I love this moisturizer and I have recommended it to everyone I know."
I truly liked Garnier Skin Active Brighter Brightening Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. It's light but very moisturizing. After using for a week consistently I can't say I noticed a big difference in the brighten of my skin. It did feel very subtle and soft. I did have to reapply often because my skin is super dry. All and all its definitely a moisturizer I could wear under my makeup and it doesn't feel too heavy.
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 left my skin really soft, smooth and more supple, my skin is definitely brighter and it's way more moisturized! It's no longer dry and flakey or dull! I noticed a lot of improvement on my cheeks where I have rosacea! Plus it protects my skin from the sun with the SPF15! I love it!!"
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is an innovative product that yields results quickly. After one week of use, my skin is more moisturized and the skin tone is more even. It is so simple and quick to use. It leaves no oily, greasy feeling on your skin."
"I took the Clearly Brighter Challenge because I was looking for a new moisturizer that had SPF included. This product is easy to use and never left my skin feeling oily or clogged. Over the course of the challenge my skin has tightened,particularly around my eyes and I love the fact that I don't need additional sunscreen. My skin is definatly brighter.This is now my go to moisturizer. Thank you Garnier."
"I really enjoyed using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15. It has a light citrus fragrance that was perfect for my a.m. wake up routine. This moisturizer went on smooth and did not leave me with the awful bluish grey tint that a lot of sunscreens cause on darker skin. My face was noticably smoother and softer, but I can't say I felt it was brighter. Perhaps with continued use I'll see a more even skin tone. I will continue to use this as my daily moisturizer."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer does exactly what it says that it will do. It does brighten and smooth the skin while providing a decent spf to help protect the skin against the harmful UVA and UVB rays of the sun. However, I was unable to give it five stars because it caused my skin to break out. If you don't have acne prone skin, then this moisturizer is for you, but if you do have acne prone skin, it may not be the best option for a daily moisturizer."
I really like the effects of garniers skinactive clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf15. The moisturizer is very lightweight and isn't greasy at all. This moisturizer can be used along with my makeup and other daily products. It's very effective at keeping my skin moisturized and looking soft and smooth. The moisturizer has been effective at getting my skin a bit brighter than it originally was. It looks clean
I love the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It is amazing and it has made my skin look so much brighter and healthier. It absorbs into the skin quickly and makes my skin so moisturized. This has kept me looking healthy and happy. My skin is not as dull and it looks great thanks to Garnier.
"I love this Garnier moisturizer! I originally have very dry skin, so coming out of winter, you can imagine what a mess my skin was. This stuff works!! After just a week of trying it my skin looks so hydrated and glowing! This will most certainly be my new go to moisturizer!"
"This product is great for sensitive skin, it doesn't irritate at all and it doesn't feel oily on the skin being oil free.Using this product has made my face much brighter than usual and less red which is a plus for me because whenever I try a new product, my face tends to get irritated.This product has SPF 15 which is good to protect from the sun and the fact that it is also a moisturizer, it ends up being a must have.I use this morning and night and my face has never felt more refreshed, more brighter and healthier than before."
I really liked the Garnier Clearly Brightener moisturizer it is in a cream form so it feels kinda thick. I lied that is had SPF15 because then I can just apply moisturizer an go. The one thing I don't really care for is the smell but Its not to strong it goes away after a while so i suppose i would rather it has a good smell than some faceproducts that have a weird smell.
"I love how the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer makes my skin look and feel healthier! It goes on really comfortably and absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy feeling behind. I also really enjoy the fact that it doesn't irritate my dry, sensitive skin like many skin care products do."
"This product is very good. I used it on my face and I see much less redness and dryness. Also, some blemishes are gone.I am breaking out a little but I am not sure if it is because of the cream or because other reasons.Overall, I am ver happy with the Moisturizer."
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a wonderful product. It instantly makes my skin look and feel softer and brighter. I love how it absorbs into my skin quickly and gives me a radiant look while keeping my skin moisturized. It's just a bonus that it has SPF in it. It will be great to use this summer!
"This is a great moisturizer. I like that it has sunscreen in it so I don't have to worry about buying any. I like that it's fast absorbing and non-greasy. My skin looks healthier, a more even skin tone, and I have brighter looking skin. The scent is also fresh. I have very sensitive skin and this didn't irritate my skin at all. I highly recommend!"
"Thank you Chick Advisor for giving me this opportunity to try the product! I like that this product is light and doesn't feel greasy on my face. I also like the smell. I've tried it for 7 weeks now and I can see that my skin is brighter and does not seem as dull. I've had better result with a different product but they are way more expensive than this product. So for this price range, I think it's effective as it can get. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
During the first application I could feel the moisturizer tingling against my skin. I think that indicated that it was working. Day by day I would notice that my skin felt more smooth and soft. I love that it has VITAMIN C in it to help give me that great glow after only 7 day. So excited to continue using this product. My only con is that the tingling feeling last for a while and can be uncomfortable for some people.
"I took the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 challenge for one week. My skin feels smoother and it seems to lessen my wrinkles, so I would say that is a great indicator of what this product will do if you use it all the time. Thank you for letting me sample this."
"Garner clearly Brighter is definitely a step above other mass merchandiser moisturizers. It has easily shown effects after only a short amount of time. I also love that there is an SPF 15 included,so I feel Better about protecting my skin this summer. I normally buy a fairly expensive brand of moisturizer, this is pretty close for a fraction of the price. I loved the consistency and texture of this cream, not running like a lotion."
"The thing that gets me the most with moisturizers is the greasiness. The feeling right after you wash your face that you're rubbing grease on it. I am so glad that Garnier heard the cry of their customers and made Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It is honestly the first moisturizer that I have used that hasn't been oily. It has made my make-up glide on and look less blotchy. I also love that it has a SPF. I would recommend you give it a try. I think you will be hooked, too!"
Very good moisturizer and I feel like my skin did improve a bit. The only con is I like to massage my face with lotion but if you overdo it will end up like little clumps on your face and I believe thats the case with all moisturizers with sunscreen so all in all great product.
I have received samples of Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 complimentary from crowdtap. The moisturizer is oil-free which makes it non-greasy and very light-weight in consistency. It is absorbed in the skin seamlessly. I do like that it contains SPF15 which makes it perfect for daily use especially since spring is here & summer is approaching.
"This product did exactly what it said it would. My skin is clearer, brighter and definitely smoother. Gone are the dry patches that were there. My fine lines are diminishing and my eyes seem to look so much more healthy. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to get rid of their winter skin and get ready for summer!"
Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF is a great product if you're looking for a lightweight and glowing moisturizer that won't break you out or clog your pores. I'm very satisfied with this product and would highly recommend it.
"I have found my new favorite moisturizer! This moisturizer evened out my uneven skin tone and left even stubborn dry spots feeling soft and hydrated. It began to work after just a couple of days, and the results continue to improve, even after a week of use. I love that it provides SPF protection and that it smells so good!"
"I loved this product. It smelled great, did not leave me feeling greasy or heavy. The product had a great texture and applied smoothly and evenly. It was absolutely wonderful! I immediately ran out and bought a full size bottle after trying the sample."
First of all I am in love with the scent of the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It leaves my skin smelling good and soft. On top of it it contains SPF which is very important for me. I live in Texas and nobody needs a sunburn.
I absolutely loved trying the Garnier Skinactive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. This mositurizer gave my skin an all day healthy glow and smoothed out the redness. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great face moisturizer that wont dry them out.
"I love that this is a moisturizer with SPF. It helps me to protect my skin, in addition to moisturizing it. I did see some breakouts in my first week of use, but I have sensitive skin and I'm hoping that it'll clear up after another week of regular use."
I really enjoyed this product. The sun screen kind of set me off a little bit but thats a added bonus to help with the sun whenever it does come out. It made my face feel super great and smooth right away. I loved it very much I had to let my friends and family try it too.
It is a great product for uneven skin tone and dark marks. I notice a more healthier supplier look to my face. I also love the SPF in it because I hate sun on my face. I noticed the SPF does its job. I was in the car and the sun was blaring in my face and it reflected it face wasn't even irritated. This product is also good for acne and senstive skin. Most products break me out but this didn't thank God. ❤
I truly enjoyed the opportunity to take the Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 Challenge. Thank you for the opportunity. In one week i have seen a noticeable difference in my skin's texture and tone. My skin is smooth and more even toned.
"I think it's a real great moisturizer. It absorbs fast and leaves your skin feeling very soft right away. It smells fantastic! That was the first thing everyone I gave a sample to said! I like that there is no greasy feeling to it. I tried the 7 day challenge and didn't see a huge improvement, but, I can definitely see some changes and I will be continuing to use it because I think in a few more weeks the change in my skin are going to be very evident! I think over all it's a very great product!"
A lot of products with SPF in them make my skin break out. This did not cause that at all. I love how silky it glides onto my skin. It has a pleasant scent that I really like. This feels light and is gentle on my skin. It does not feel like other products that have SPF in them that are greasy and heavy. I think my skin looks brighter after using this for a week. I was able to share my samples with a few friends.
I wasn't a sampling of Garnier skin active clearly brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer SPF 15 from crowdtap. I love this moisturizer it works great I do feel like my skin is brighter I use it every day it is a great product it has an SPF of 15 which is great now that spring is here I have also given some to my friends and they loved it and are planning to buy more when their sample runs out
"I've been very happy with how my face has been looking these past few days. Brighter, healthier and ready to go outside and show it off. My face just seems more fresh and smooth and very clean and bright. I am going to keep using Garnier skin active and keep the improvement coming!"
"I was not a fan of this product, and I cant completely blame it on the product, as I believe it's just not right for my skin. It was heavy and greasy and left my skin with a slight burning feeling. The SPF scent was too strong. I love every Garnier product, but this one didn't live up to my expectations."
"This is a light but not greasy moisturizer. I like that it has the sunscreen in it so you do not have to use 2 different products. Left my skin feeling great. I would give 5 stars but I don't like the flowery smell much, if it was scent free it would be perfect.I received this product to try for free from crowdtap for my honest review. The opinions in this review are 100% my own."
"I use harsh products to help with my adult acne. So when i saw this, i was like this cant help! Something so simple and in the stores? Well i was proven wrong by Garnier! Using Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer has been amazing. After i wash the other stuff from my face, i apply this right away! My face feels amazing though out the day because of this! I know have more confidence when i walk around and not worry if people are judging my face! So thank you Garnier for that back!!"
"Garnier Clearly Brightly is a nice lightweight moisturizer. It is lightly scented, absorbs quickly and didn't leave my fave feeling greasy. While it left my face hydrated and soft, My complection did not appear any brighter. As a moisturizer it got the job done."
"I loved the sample of Garnier's new SkinActive Clearly Brighter moisturizer. After two weeks of using the product, I have a noticeably brighter complexion. Having the SPF built in is great and a huge time saver. Pleasant scent and goes on smooth with no greasy after feel."
I really enjoyed using this moisturizer. It goes on so smoothly and doesn't leave me feeling greasy or shiny. The moisturizer made my skin so much brighter and more fresh looking. It even feels smoother. I will definitely continue to use this moisturizer and look forward to even more wonderful results. I took off one star because it does smell a bit funky.
I was on the hunt for a moisturizer which could give me the protection and hydration my combination skin needed when staying indoors.This feels like a thinner version of sunscreen yet disappears like i have nothing on my face within few minutes of applying(i am dark toned).My skin is clog prone and surprisingly enough i didn't get any additional clogs after using this for a while.
"I was actually disappointed in the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. When I think of a moisturizer, I think of a product I'm going to use under my make-up. Perhaps Clearly Brighter isn't supposed to be used this way -- or I'm missing something. The package says it's a sunscreen. So am I supposed to use it over my makeup?? I tried using it as a moisturizer, but when I tried to apply my foundation over it, Clearly Brighter flaked and made a mess. I didn't enjoy it."
"When I first used this, I noticed it didn't smell bad at all. It actually has a nice, subtle scent to it. It goes on smooth, and doesn't leave a sticky feeling or a greasy feeling behind. So it is as if I never put it on, except my skin isn't so dry. We haven't had enough sun yet to determine how it does against sun protection."
"I was surprised with the great results I received from Garnier Clearly Brighter daily moisturizer. I noticed my skin pretty clear. I didn't have any problems with sensitivity, break outs or redness. I'm a fan of Garnier and I just started using their products and I will continue to use them. My skin is happy and healthy looking. I received this as a sample from Crowdtap in exchange for an honest review."
I was beyond impressed with Garnier's SkinActive Mousturizer with SPF 15! The light scent is refreshing and isn't overpowering. Their oil free formula leaves my skin looking so good. The moisturizer absorbs right into my skin and made my skin feel smooth from the very first use.
"The Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is amazing. It is a moisturizer for daily use with SPF 15. It keeps skin clear, bright, soft and smooth while protecting it from the sun. I have noticed huge difference in my skin. It has became my favorite moisturizer. I would highly recommend it."
"I liked this product as it was not too thick when applying to my face and that my skin absorbed it well. I does contain scent but it is not overpowering. I did not have any issues with irritation or breakouts while using this product and I appreciate that it does have SPF 15. Although I didn't see the brightening effects, I did only use the product for one week."
"I received Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer from Crowdtap for free to sample! I have used the product for a week and love it!! I have seen an amazing difference in my skin. My crow's feet and forehead crease have both gotten less noticeable and my skin feels amazing! I love how light the moisturizer is and how amazing that it smells!! I love this and am now a huge fan! I also love that I have the confidence of knowing that my skin is protected by the SPF 15 all day long~,"
"I think the actual product is fine. Nothing amazing but my skin didn't break out and was acceptably soft. The price would not be outrageous as it's Garnier and would be in stores like CVS and Target. However, I was so turned off by the smell! It was way too strong and I could still smell myself a few hours later at work. Ew!"
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is amazing. It isn't greasy or sticky feeling.It has a very light smell. It leaves your skin hydrated and feeling brighter and younger.This is really a great product.
"I really love this moisturizer. It's not too thick, or too thin. It glides on your skin very smoothly, and it doens't leave your skin sticky or greasy. It has definately helped my foundation go on smoother in the morning. I haven't noticed much of a difference in if it makes my skin brighter or not, but I would still use it as a daily moisturizer. I love the fact that it has SPF in it, my skin is pretty fair and prone to burning and sun damage."
"It is very light weight, not thick and it blends right into your face. My favorite thing about this is that it is oil free. My skin is already oily by it self so i don't need a moisturizer that will leave my face oily. This is perfect. I can wear it all day long and it won't put any oils on my skin."
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a wonderful product, I have used it everyday since receiving my free samples from Crowdtap. I love how it has a great smell, nothing to strong but a nice light scent. I also love how its non greasy. I have been using this on my face, neck and chest. After applying, my skin is soft and smooth. I think this is a great product and I will definitely recommend."
I have to say that I was not expecting the results that I got from this product. I was skeptical to say the least. I would absolutely refer anyone of my friends to use this product especially those that are looking for a good moisturizer and sun protector in
"I love Garnier's SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. The SPF saves me a step in my morning regiment. It feels very light on the skin and is quick to put on. The subtle scent also lets me use a perfume without the smells mixing. Plus, my mum can even use this with her sensitive skin! You couldn't ask for more."
"I really enjoy using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I love that it is a non oil moisturizer. I have oily and acne prone skin and I have found that this is the best moisturizer Ive ever used for my type of skin. Usually my face is extremely oily when I wake up in the morning, ever since using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 I have woken up with a fresh non oily face. I love it!"
I love this product. There was a dry spot on my eye lid that I had been using different products to moisturize but it just kept coming back. It didn't take long after I started using this product for the spot to go away and it hasn't been back. There is a spot on my chin that has a different texture than the rest of my face skin. I definitely see a difference of that area when I use this products vs. When I dont. This product isn't greasy and absorbs into the skin quickly.
"I love that Garnier is a brand I already love and trust. I also spend a lot of time outside with my children and enjoying my hobbies. With Garnier Clearly Brighter, I can moisturize my face and protect myself from harm UV rays. I was liked how smooth the lotion applied over my face. It was not a watery feel or a thick paste like feel. I will continue using this product in the future."
"First of all, I have never loved a lotion scent more than this! It smells amazing. Second, it absolutely works. The results for me have been absolutely phenomenal I notice a significant improvement in the brightness of my eyes and the smoothness of my face when applying makeup. I will absolutely be buying this product. So thankful I got to try it for free"
"My skin freaks out and-or breaks out most times when I introduce a new product into my skincare routine. So the first thing I noticed about this moisturizer was how well my skin took to it. It was very gentle and did not break me out at all. With the SPF protection, I already knew I was in love.When I first began the Clearly Brighter Challenge, I took a photo of my face. It's been a little over a week, and I can see a difference. It looks more even, a little brighter, and healthier. I'm a convert!"
"This is a great moisturizer if you don't wear makeup every day. It makes thr makeup feel oily and promotes creasing. I simply switched to using it at night and the issue resolved itself. The scent is very strong for a face cream, but you get used to it. Overall, it was great to see my face responding to it. Would cautiously recommend."
"I received a full size product from Allure in exchange for a review. I have been using this for a week now, and my skin feels great! It's not too heavy for my combination skin. I really like that it has SPF 15 to protect my skin from sun damage. My skin looks and feels great after a week!"
"I'm not sure if it'll happen with every skin type, but I have basic, normal skin—no problems with anything. but this gave me reporial dermatitis, it's a rash around the nose and mouth. I personally am not happy with it but if you use this and that happens, just stop using it I guess :("
I like this product for the light weight formula. You can easily wear this all day without getting greasy or oily. I love that the sun protection is an added bonus. The product leaves your skin feeling instantly softer and moisturized. It also has a fresh scent that you cant resist.
The Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is truly wonderful. you see immediate results after just 1 week of applying. I admire the glowing affects and moisturizing qualities of this product and have already shared it with my friends and family.
This is a great product! I love that is goes on light and blends into my skin well! I wear it under make-up and then use again in the evening. I like that I get SPF 15 during the day when I am out and about. I have noticed my sking looking more radiant and feeling hydrated!
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer has a very nice citrus, floral fresh smell to it. It has the consistency of a mid weight facial cream that absorbs very quickly into the skin on your face, This product can be used as a base under your makeup and also acts as a great moisturizer. This product has an SPF of 15 which is nice to have some bit of sunscreen in it"
"Great product. Oil free and SPF. Within days you can see a evening tone in my facial skin. Also, a great base for makeup or use as a everyday daily moisturizer. Highly recommend this product to anyone w acne prone skin or to anyone looking for a great everyday facialLotion."
I really am impressed with Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. The scent is amazing! they should create a body lotion with that same scent. It is so clean and fresh smelling. I love that the lotion is lightweight enough to use all the time. The lotion nicely moisturizes without being greasy. I love being able to use it alone before going outside to work in the yard or to participate in outdoor activities. The lotion does not cause sweating and includes an SPF15 factor.
"I think Garnier has a wonderful product here. It does clearly brighten and smooth my skin. And I love that is contains SPF15. It absorbs so quickly into my skin after applying. I almost forget that I am wearing it. Except for the smell. It has an odd smell, but not one that I cannot get used to."
I really enjoy using this product because it helps with my skin tones and also has SPF which I don't add to my daily routine so the all in one bottle is my kind of go to item in the morning. This doesn't have a strong scent and it has a pump style bottle. so this is a great product to have!
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 exceeded my expectations! My skin was hydrated and protected from the sun, and after a week of wearing, I noticed it was smoother with less dry skin. The ingredients gently exfoliated dead skin cells during the week, leaving a smoother surface."
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer has a nice citrus, floral fresh smell to it. It has the consistency of a mid weight facial cream however it absorbs fairly quickly into the skin, you could use this under your makeup without any issues. Has an SPF of 15 which is ok but I personally would wish for something a bit higher. Other then that, i really enjoyed using this product and the way it made my face feel after every use."
Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is so light it doesn't clog my skin like a lot of the SPF products do. It has a light kind of citrusy scent which I love. The moisturizing it provides is great and I love how it makes my skin feel. So glad I was able to review this thanks to Crowdtap and Garnier.
"non-greasy formula took my rough skin and made it look super smooth., I have super sensitive skin and have tried all kinds of stuff and this made my skin not break out and made it look amazing. My skin has a nice texture to it and not looking so rough. I loved that it only took 1 week to see the big results. After the first use I was able to start to feel my skin changing. It doesnt make your skin look oily and it doesnt make it so that it is rough I loved that it had suncreen in it as well so that it also protects my skin form the sun rays."
"This product is really great. I am very grateful to have had it as a sample. My skin is much brighter, softer and smoother than before. I plan on using this product for a long time. It absorbs very easily into my skin, has a nice soft fragrance and feels very light on the surface. I just love this product!"
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening Moisturizer has become my newfound friend. It makes my skin feel so healthy and nourished. Plus it adds a natural healthy glow to my face! I received this product to sample in exchange for my honest review.
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF-15 really makes your skin look fresh and younger. It helps you get rid of the dry scaley skin and makes your face look healthier. Thank you for allowing me to sample your product. I am hooked, and will be replacing all my other moisturizing products with yours."
"First, a little comparison, before using Garnier moisturizer, Aveeno was using daily moisturizer. Clearly brighter is lighter than the Aveeno, but the two superfast absorb into the skin. I give five stars to Crearly brighter because I helped my skin cleared me more, is not greasy, apply it all over my face and neck, do not apply near the eyes because if irritated. I have some dryness in the area of the nose, that is not helping me to fight dryness."
"I was skeptical. Most moisturizers with SPF leave your skin feeling greasy and they make you want to wash your face again just to get it off, but Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter didn't feel like that. You put it on, and it's like there's nothing on your face! The smell is nice, and the texture is, too. It goes on smoothly, and leaves your skin feeling good, even after a few hours."
The formula of this product is thick and you need a little bit of product to put in your face. The odor of the product is good. And with the continue of the product you feel your skin with a great moisture. In my personal opinion my feel look bright with the continuous use of that.
"Take the challenge and you'll be so glad. After having developed dry skin from winter's dry air, I started to look around for a remedy. Within a week my skin started to look so much better. My skin felt hydrated and clearer. The daily moisturizer has a soft flowery scent and glides on smoothly. My favorite part is that it has Broad Spectrum SPF15!"
"I personally liked the way my skin felt after using it...except for the major break out it caused. I already have very sensitive skin, so it's going to take some time for my face to get use to this new product. After one week of use, yes my skin is clearly brighter, but it's also blemished. Maybe once I get use to this product, that will not be an issue anymore. Other than that tho, I like the way my skin feels and looks (where I'm not broke out) after just one week."
My favorite thing about thing about Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is the fact that it's a daily moisterizing lotion that makes my face feel super smooth and that it's a sunscreen. So if I have to be out in the sun I don't have to worry about getting burned! And my face will still be moisterized!
"This is a great product. I have oily skin, so I am particular about the moisturizers I use. The anti-oxidants actually help my skin, and didn't increase my acne, if anything, it helped improve it's clarity and overall tone! The moisturizer goes on smoothly and dissolves easily into my skin. The SPF 15 is a great benefit, as I don't consider using any moisturizer unless it has SPF."
"I loved this moisturizer with added SPF. It was a breeze being able to apply both at the same time and it did not feel oily. The only issue was it felt a little heavy on my face when applying but the trick is to start with far less than you'd really use and work it into your skin before applying more. Overall, I loved the product and would recommend to family and friends"
I really love the feeling of my skin after using the moisturizer. I love that it's SPF 15. I definitely notice a difference and just the couple weeks that I'm using it. I will continue to use so and I will also give samples to my girlfriend so they can see what a difference it can make in their skin.
It is a good moisturizer for daily purpose. So light and the fragrance is also light. It moisturizes my skin whole day without making it feel oily. I apply it daily. My skin started looking more younger and glowing. I got this product to try as a sample mission.
I liked the feel of my skin after applying this moisturizer. It didn't feel greasy and it didn't feel dry. It felt quite soft and it was easy apply my makeup after. I liked that there was an SPF included. I didn't really see a difference in brightness of my skin but maybe it takes a little longer than using it for a week. I will definitely keep using and see if it really does what it says.
After experiencing Garnier's Clearly Brighter Brightening and smoothing moisturizer I can say my face felt truly polished. Clean and brighter even hours after applying. It was if the sun added a golden kiss to my skin. I'm indoors a fair amount of the day and I can normally feel it and see it written on my face but after a week of Clearly brighter it's as if my skin has absorbed the suns glowing rays (while being protected by a SPF of course). Thanks Garnier
"I enjoyed using the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. My skin does seem a bit brighter and softer from when I first started using it. The product applies easily, it does not feel heavy at all, it sinks into skin well. It did not feel greasy, and did not cause breakouts. I love that it has SPF15 as all I have to use is this product and my face is protected from the sun."
I am in love with the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It smells great and makes my skin feel fantastic. My skin looks and feels great after using this moisturizer. I would definitely recommend this product!
"I really liked Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. You hardly need to put much on, a little goes a long way. It glides on super smooth! It has a pleasant fragrance. It leaves king soft and smooth and glowing. Does not make my face oily like most moisturizers with spf. Great product!"
"I loved how Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 made my skin feel even on day 1. My skin is so soft when I use this product. It has stopped a lot of the redness I was experiencing; It tamed my breakouts; and also made my skin look smooth and soft... all while protecting me from harmful UV rays. I absolutely love this product and I have recommended it to a few of the girls I work with, my mom, my 3 sisters, and some of my friends. It really is a great product!"
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is such an amazing product. I love how my skin feels after I use it. I feel moisturized and know that my skin is protected from the sun. The scent is very refreshing,which I love as well. I highly recommend this to anyone."
"After I using this product every day for a week, I noticed that my skin feels smoother. I also noticed that my skin started glowing. I use it on my face & neck every morning after I washed my face. This moisturizer absorbs really easily and it leaves my skin feel so soft and smooth and moist. I've not had any break outs or irritation from using it. So far I love it and I will continue using it and recommend it to my friends too."
"I was skeptical about all the claims Garnier was making about this moisturizer, however after trying it I am pleased with the results. My skin is smoother, more even toned and slightly brighter than it was before using this product. I am shocked at the difference! I received a free sample of the product and will now be going out and buying the full size version!"
This really changed the way I moisturized. I was able to forget products and just use this one because it does so many things! I now don't have to use and extra brightner or spf because its rolled out all in one product with a moisturizer. It made my skin glow and I noticed the texture looked smoother and felt softer to the touch. I loved it and will be buying again.
"i gave others samples so we could all try, we all loved the smell and the feel, not greasy, it made are faces brighter, and my mom and i worry more about wrinkles and spots think we notice an improvement. I'm just glad my daughter is using a moisturizer with spf"
"I used this product for two weeks and first noticed how heavy it was on my already oily face. I didn't like it. Now I have blackheads all over my cheeks and I don't know where they came from, but I'm going to assume it was this, as it was the only change I made."
"I got to sample Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 and it does what it states. It left my skin soft, smooth, and bright. It also protected my skin form the weather. This product is great for everyday use. It has a soft scent not over powering. I like this product and would recommend this product."
This is a very creamy yet light weight formula that I think can be used any time of the year. it's heavy enough to hydrate in the winter but light enough to use in summer and not feel greasy. i think it did help my skin look better in just 7 days but not drastically. i think it will take more time than 7 days to really change your complexion. but if your someone who doesn't moisturize at all i can say this would give a big difference in 7 days.
"After taking the Clearly Brighter Garnier challenge, I am on the fence. The cream definitely made my skin softer and more hydrated, and I LOVE that it has an SPF, but it didn't really make a difference in brightening my skin. Maybe I expect too much when I hope to actually see that a product lives up to its claims"
"I love, love the scent of this product. I like the fact that it does not leave my skin oily. My skin is already oily so you run at the fact of putting moisturizer on. Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is perfect being oil free."
I love this product! I've been using it a little more than a week. I've noticed a difference in my skin it is smoother and more even tone. I love the fact that it doesn't leave your face feeling oily or greasy! (Unlike other products from the past) The fact that this has SPF is even better. I live in Texas and have fair skin so having that protection is important to me.
"I really enjoyed trying out this product, I am always a little hesitant because my face breaks out easily. However, I did not have any added breakouts while using this product. It left my skin feeling smooth and soft, I'm excited to see how it improves my skin the longer I use it. The product is not oily nor does it leave my skin feeling oily. It is a light refreshing moisturizer for my face. I definitely recommend it for anyone that has those lovely rough patches on their cheeks, or really just anyone that wants a great moisturizer!"
"I recently took the Clearly Brighter Challenge for 1 week. I liked the smell of the product...it wasn't too overwhelming and was fresh. It made my skin feel light and clean, not oily or weighed down like with some products. I think my skin has a slight brighter appearance. I like that it has the spf in it, but haven't been able to test that yet as we haven't had any nice sunny weather. I will continue to use for the next month to see if I have a clearer, brighter complexion."
This moisturizer was nice left my face noticebley shinier and brighter looking not weighed down and surely did not dry out my face like some others tend to do after a few uses and no greasey left over residue. Nice bonus is the spf coverage for when I am on the go I know I am covered
I have been using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15for a few weeks now and I am very impressed! My friend who burned his face at the beach has been using it and we have seen a vst difference in the appearance of his skin!!
"GREAT moisturizer I can use more than once a day. It does on smooth, absorbs quickly and does not get greasy or oily. My skin feels hydrated all day AND I do not notice flakes on my skin from dryness. I also love how it is a great base to my foundation. I feel like my foundation goes on better now, which make me feel more confident!"
Having olive skin tone I always have an issue with White color film from most sunscreens or lotions but never had this issue with Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It absorbs so quickly and does not look white or thin sheet on skin. Also it is quite moisturizing for summer and leave my skin feeling soft.
"I love how light Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is!! It goes on effortlessly, leaves my skin soft and looking brighter and it does not clog my pores! Love the SPF protection it provides and it is a great base layer for underneath my make up!"
"I have so much to say about this moisturizer it left my face feeling fresh and smooth and knowing that I have a spf in my daily moisturizer is the best feeling the world. making my skin look young again. I was happy to take on the challenge and will continue using the product daily. I love the way it works I love the way it smell, I love the way it make me feel!!! I love this product"
I am loving the way that this Garnier Skin Active makes my skin look and feel. It is smoother than ever and it looks like the dark spots i have on my face from years in the sun are actually fading. If they fade even a small little bit then i am sold on this.I use it at night and after i wash my face in the morning before i go out in the sun i put it on to protect it from harmful rays. I took the clearly bright challenge and i must say i love it. I recieved this product free for testing but opinions i give are 100% mine!
"I received a sample from Allure Beauty Enthusiasts and Garnier to try and am so grateful I did, I love it! It is a great everyday moisturizer that leaves skin smooth. I have two sunspots that have already diminished and fine lines have improved! I love that it contains SPF 15 now we will be outdoors more. I will be using it every morning all summer long!"
"I really enjoyed this product. The small sample sizes were perfect and I was able to fit them into my purse,luggage,diaper bag,car and office so I have protection where ever I go. The moisturizer was not oily and did not leave a greasy film on my skin which I loved. I also really like that it has SPF in it. As someone who is battling skin cancer, any extra protection I can get is extremely appreciated and makes me far more likely to purchase this product."
Before starting Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Mooterizer my skin was feeling rough and wasn't making me feel my best. Just over a week of using it and my skin is visibly smoother and feels so much better. I wish I had been using this instead of my current product. I would definitely reccomend to anyone wanting a better daily facial moisturizer!
"I was really excited to try the new Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15. It has been one of my favorite products since I got to try this samples. I love the smell, and the way it feels on my skin. I have really sensitive skin and Im NOT able to use a lot a facial products because it gets easily irritated. But, this product I've seen really great results in just on week and I haven't had any type of problems with it."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15The moisturizer is good enough and moisturize the skin very well. It is not greasy at all so leaves my skin non greasy . I have oily skin , so i found this very good for my skin. It absorbs quickly in few seconds. It has good smell citrus like smell. It also have sun protection formula which is going to be beneficial during summers. i am going to purchase it in future"
"I started using Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 and just after 7 days of use my skin is so much brighter, even toned, and smoother. Didn't if it would really work for me or not, but here to say it did. I am so happy with the way my face is now."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a great moisturizer. I took a weekly challenge and used this product daily and nightly, I saw a change in my overall skin appearance in that short time. My skin is smoother and brighter noticing diminished redness. The fragrance is pleasant and the moisturizer contains a sunscreen for needed protection. Garnier is a brand I trust and I will continue to use this product for my future moisturizing needs."
"This moisturizer really worked for me! I have normal-dry skin, and some dark spots an discoloration. It's hard to tell if my dark spots were lightened-brightened, but overall my face looked.. more luminous? The noticeable SPF certainly helped. If your skin is very dry, this formula probably won't be moisturizing enough, but can certainly be an added step if your normal moisturizer does not contain SPF."
"Its a good spring-summer moisturizer. It's lightweight, provides SPF, smells great, feels great. My skin is a bit brighter, and very soft. I would say this would be a good go to for half the year. I don't think it would provide enough moisture benefits for use during the fall-winter though."
"Definitely worthy of trying out! Depending on skin types I'm sure different people will have different results but I absolutely love the way it makes my skin feel. Because of that I feel so much more comfortable, my face feels brighter and I absolutely love it!"
"First off I loved how lightweight this moisturizer is. It is the perfect weight for summer time. I also was very pleased with the scent of this product, it was nice and light. Secondly I loved that it provided adequate sun protection, I used it on a very sunny day and my very fair skin did not get burned."
"Finding a good moisturizer with sunscreen is difficult when you have combination skin, so when I received oil-free Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with broad spectrum SPF 15, I was eager to try it. This moisturizer goes on light with a gentle, pleasant scent. It has good coverage with only a little bit."
"I really liked the scent and consistency of the moisturizer. The scent was clean and the constancy was just right and absorbed into my skin easily. I also liked that it has SPF 15 added in. That is one step I can skip and one more layer of defense from sun damage. I have a few small age spots I was hoping to see fade, I did not though I used the moisturizer day and night. That was my biggest disappointment with the lotion. But over all I liked it and would continue to use it."
I love Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Mosturizer! It has a great refreshing scent and it is oil free! It's a fabulous multi use daily Mosturizer. While even your skin tones it's also giving you that smooth feel and look all while protecting your skin from the sun! Did an outstanding job for my skin! Now I can go throughout the day feeling confident about my skin.
I received Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 from CrowdTap to test and review. I must say it has really changed my skin. It's now really soft and no longer dry looking. It has brightened my skin. Must say I really love this product!!
"I really did notice a change in how much brighter my face was after only a week. I loved how it moisturized my face without leaving it oily. Unlike other products I've tried, this one didn't cause break outs and didn't leave my face irritated. I applied this and then applied my regular makeup right over top and it still looked natural. I also liked how it has a pleasant smell. I would highly recommend this to everyone!"
This is a wonderful product that really is effective and really helped to improve the quality and appearance of my skin. I was very happy wit the results after taking the Clearly Brighter Challenge. The formula of the product is perfect and my skin is sensitive and had no reaction to it! I will definitely be purchasing this again in the future. Overall I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family!
"I really liked the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF15. It felt nice and light on my face and wasn't greasy. It also has a fresh fragrance which I really liked. The SPF 15 protection makes it a great daytime moisturizer, offering just enough protection from the sun."
I really love using this Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer because it really makes my skin feel soft and smooth and protects it when I'm out in the sun. My skin seems more radiant and fresh looking and I love that it protects when I'm outside.
"it is an all in one product that gives my skin a soft glow, moisturizes and protects with SPF from the suns rays. It is light enough to wear under make up and protect all day long. Easy to apply and smells great, like oranges. I really love this product and cannot wait to see what else Garnier comes out with in the future."
"I liked this moisturizer a lot because it actually did brighten my skin. I could tell that it provided sun protection, but I'd like it a bit higher if possible so I could wear this alone on a sunny day. My skin is also so soft, so I'm not sure what the smoothing action is, but I like how sensitive it is for my combination skin."
"I absolutely love this product, I was skeptical at first because a lot of moisturizers leave a sticky residue on my face but not this, it left my skin feeling silky and smooth, I love that it has SPF15 in it! I worry alot about skin cancer and it reassures me knowing that my face is protected, I also love the packaging and bottle size a little goes a long way."
"The smell of this is very citrusy but in a good way, it's very light. As soon as you apply it you can feel your skin getting super moisturized. It doesn't make your skin oily and doesn't make you break out. I have sensitive skin and this worked for me. I used it for a week and this gave me a natural looking glow. It left my skin slightly brighter which is a good thing. Not only does it help your skin looking healthy it has an spf of 15 as well which is awesome."
It is ok. It take a little bit longer to rub into your skin. I like the scent at first but it is way too over powering and after a few minutes I get bothered by the smell. My skin felt smoother right away after the first application and had a glow to it. I like that it is not oily either and feels nice on my skin. Usually when I put a sunscreen moiturizer on I look forward to washing it off because my skin feels heavy and greasy.
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 has brightened my facial skin, and has lightened my dark undereye circles. I like that Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 has improved my skin's texture. Fine lines have disappeared. The scent is fresh and light, the moisturizer feels light in my hand and on my skin. Yet it has a SPF16. However unline some products that have a SPF15 this product does not have a greasy feel on skin."
"I seem to always be looking for a new moisturizer because I like having SPF added in it. Getting to sample this product was great because I found exactly what I wanted! The texture is great, it smells amazing, and my skin looks and feels fantastic! I am already recommending this to my friends."
I am in love with Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I have noticed that my skin is more radiant and bright and that my dark spots have faded a bit in just a litltle bit of time. I reallyappreciate the fact that it has SPF 15 to help prevent further damage to my skin to keep me looking young as long as possible! It is very lightweight and feels great on. It soaks into the skin well and isn't greasy at all. This is my new moisturizer!
I liked how quick the product absorbed into my skin but I honestly did not notice a visible difference in the matter of a more brighter complexion. Perhaps if I continue using this product as part of my cleansing regimen then I might see a difference but it's too hard to tell in such a short time frame.
This stuff is amazing! I have acne prone skin and a lot of redness cause of acne and hyperpigmentaion. This moisturizer really helped to calm down the redness and really made my skin brighter. My mom even noticed and I got her using it now. It also smoothed out my skin. With acne prone skin I'm not used to to this feeling of a smooth face at all. But now that I experienced it I love it! I will continue to use this stuff forever!
Garnier clearly brighter Brightening and Smoothing daily moisturizer does everything it claims to do . i used it for a week straight and my face is noticeably softer with less lines and wrinkles and it has protected my face from the sun as well. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting fine lines and wrinkles to disappear fast.
"After only one use, my skin was incredibly soft. I received this free to try, but I will be purchasing this. I've been using for a week and I've noticed a brighter, healthier complexion. This moisturizer is lightweight and has a pleasant smell that's not overbearing at all. It's gentle enough for sensitive skin because my daughter tried and had no problems. Highly recommend!"
I really liked this moisturizer. It smelled great and went on my face smoothly. It was not too runny and absorbed quickly. I like that the spf is included in this moisturizer since I tend to forget to apply this on top of my normal face routine. I'm not sure about the brightening as I didn't see this but definitely smoothing.
"I already love Garnier but mostly for my hair, this skin product is truly amazing though. I have extremely dry skin, and usually lotions only last a couple hours on me and I'm dry again, but I only had to use this moisturizer ONCE!!! My new favorite moisturizer."
"I got this product for free for review purposes and all opinions are my own.After using Garnier Clearly Brighter for a week as a challenge, i can say that this product really work for that timeframe. I like the scent of it, it smells like green tea. The cream feels a bit thick but it is not greasy. I have some small blemishes and dried areas on my face that went great after a week of using it. It looks more toned and clearer."
"I loved Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15!!! My skin looked so much brighter after 3 days!!! I tried to apply it every few hours, and I felt like that really helped protect my skin. I really though my skin looked AMAZING after the full week!! I loved it, and after I run out I will be purchasing more!"
"I love this moisturizer! It leaves my skin looking brighter, smoother and protected from the sun. It makes my skin feel hydrated and protected all day long. I enjoy the fresh scent and consistency of the moisturizer. I don't know how my skin ever went without it!"
"Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is fantastic! It makes my skin feel smooth and soft but without making it oily, which so many other lotions do. I love that it offers my skin some protection from the sun. Most of all, I LOVE that it has helped get the redness I've been experiencing for years under control!"
I really love the way Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer makes my skin feel and look. I have gotten so many compliments and I tell them what I use so they can use it too! They girls at my party really enjoyed the party and liked the product.
"I was so pleased with the results of this garnier clearly brightening smoothing daily moisturizer, firstly I was not aware that I should be using a daily moisturizer with SPF and I am so happy that now I know better. This moisturizer is so gentle but effective and has no side effects. It does indeed lighten my face with a nice glow and even skin tone that I am so ready for the summer. I highly recommend it."
After 1 week of using Garnier's SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 I noticed that my skin tone is more even and less redness around my nose and chin. After 2 weeks of using it I had the same results but I am happy with it. I do have to put on 2 layers in the morning since I have extra dry skin. I love how it's fast absorbing and non-greasy feel on my skin. I would recommend to a friend!
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF15 is a great option for women who spend time outdoors but don't want to look like they spend a lot of time outdoors. The SPF allows protection from future damage while this cream is repairing past sun damage. It works well under makeup (not too greasy). I also like to use it on my neck and chest, especially when I know I am going to be outdoors for an extended period of time. Overall, I really like this cream!"
There are so many great benefits and visible results from using this product. My issues are my eyes. They often get dark circles that takes away from the beauty of my blue eyes. This made it look much better. Also like the added SPF to prevent the sun from making fine lines or damage. Recommend this if you are trying to fix these things quickly or maintain healthy skin over time.
I really love Garnier moisturizer. It really works great to make your skin feel smooth and soft. I feel like my skin is glowing and it smells great. The only downside was you have to watch how much you use or your skin feels greasy. I use a very little bit and works great so if you try it and feel greasy use less until you feel great.
I enjoyed trying this Garnier moisturizer it gave me more confidence to go about my day. And since I'm a gardener i spend a lot of time outside this was perfect. My skin feels much more moisturized and not dull. Even my husband made a comment about how great my skin looks using this new moisturizer. I highly recommend it.
"I liked how quickly it absorbed, but I did NOT like that it broke me out (see my pics for proof), or that it pilled up on my face.I was REALLY hoping this would be a replacement for my Origins moisturizer. Apparently not.Also, only 15spf? That's not enough protection for being outdoors at all. This is only appropriate for indoor wear."
"I love the new Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15! It is a moisturizer with sunscreen in it so it adds an extra layer of protection for my skin. It's a non greasy formula which is great for my normal skin. I don't like putting on any extra oils or greasy formulas to clog up my pores. At the end of the day, my face isn't greasy or oily. It actually feels moisturized, like the after effects of a facial. It's now my go to moisturizer!"
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is amazing a great prduct! It works quickly to leave my skin feeling fresh and looking wonderful and has sunscreen to keep it that way even when I am out and about all day! I will be using this from now on to keep my skin healthy and looking great.
"After using Garner SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 for about a week I can honestly say that I enjoyed it. Living in Arizona having an SPF in my facial moisturizer is a must. What I like about this one is it doesn't have a sunscreen scent, in fact I feel like it has a subtle floral scent that I personally find enjoyable. I am also an individual who suffers from oily skin and to my pleasant surprise it is oil free so my face doesn't feel oily at all after applying or even a few hours after."
"I am really enjoying Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter! My skin is smoother and brighter. I love that it has sunscreen so I don't have to worry about applying an extra product. My skin feels moisturized all day long, which is great for my dry skin. I received samples of this product free for testing and review. All opinions are completely my own."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15!!!! This face moisturizer is AMAZING!!!! The cream absorbs quickly, has a nice scent, and does exactly what it promises! Within one week, I have noticed a huge difference in the texture, softness, and my skin is clearing up! If you haven't tried Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?!?!?!? You will be amazed after just one week!!!"
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening &Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is the the best moisturizer I have ever used. It makes your skin so soft and glowing! It also evens out your skin complexion. I also use this moisturizer before I apply my makeup and it makes my makeup more brighter. I love this moisturizer and I know a lot of other women or men would enjoy using this product to!
"I like Garnier's SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. My skin feels nourished, softer and less dull. Personally, I feel more confident when I'm going outside due to the SPF protection. I tend to spend a lot of time in the sun, so I need a product like this. The only reason I didn't give it 5-5 stars if because I feel like this product takes a little while to absorb into my skin. It is not as light weight as I would like."
I loved the product. I wanted to sample it to see if it could help me with the dry skin on my face I get in the winter time or cold weather. It went above and beyond that. It left my face feeling completely moisturized and the product smells fresh and clean!
"I love this product. So many others promise awesome results, however this actually produces those great results. I honestly never thought I would give up my old reliable moisturizer, but after seeing the dark spot reduction, smoothness, and enjoying spf without an extra product to put on. Thus is my new go to product! It has a very light fresh smell and soft light feel once applied. It takes a very small amount to cover your entire face."
I really like Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. In a very short time it made my skin feel soft and eliminated most of the blemishes. My fine lines and wrinkles were also visibly reduced. I feel this is a great product that anyone can benefit from.
I really like the product...my skin felt softer and looked brightner in just a couple of days...i use it during the day and even at night to keep my skin mousterized...and i love how a little goes a long way...the smell os ok but not my favorite...other that that i really liked it...and will keep using it
"I absolutely love that Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer Spf15 moisturizes my dry skin while protecting it from the harmful rays of the sun and as a bonus it makes my skin smooth, less puffy and makes me too 10 years younger too. ♡♡♡♡ I highly recommend this wonderful product."
I really like this moisturizing sunscreen from Garnier. It smells great and goes on easily. It is very lightweight but still moisturizes and protects. It definitely makes my skin feel softer and look more radiant! I am very happy with it and this is now my go-to daily moisturizer!
I love Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer! It makes my skin feel great. It looks great too. I can just tell that I am more glowing and radiant since I started using it. I love that it has SPF 15 in it so I don't need a separate sunscreen.
I really like that this moisturizer is very light and non-greasy and absorbs quickly into your skin. I like that it doesn't have an overpowering scent but a very light and Airy smell that is very pleasant. I definitely noticed a brightening in my skin Within using it for a week or so it has helped. I definitely noticed of brightening in my skin within using it for a week or so it has helped my skin look a lot softer and smoother. I will definitely continue using this Garnier skin actives clearing brightener.
My skin is very sensitive and has a perchance of getting very irritated when trying new products. Not the case with Garnier SkinActive. I noticed a difference after clarity and hydration after only a few uses. And the fact that there is an SPF is an added bonus!
"This product really delivers what it promises. My skin is smoother and brighter. I am a overworked teacher and mother of 3. If you can make my skin brighter, you have me hooked! It has SPF in it, which is a bonus, because as mom I think of putting SPF on my kids and forget about doing it for myself. This helps me remember to take care of myself. And it is surprisingly light and quick absorbing even with the SPF."
"After receiving this product as a free sample from Allure Beauty Enthusiasts, I tried it for 7 days and will continue to use it. Most days I use a moisturizer and a brightening primer, but did not feel the need to do so, after a few uses. One day I even went without foundation. I like that it isn't super thick and rubs in easily. Even though it is SPF 15 it did not make my skin look ""white washed"" at all."
Not only did it make my skin super soft but it actually did brighten it up as well. I have to admit I was skeptical at first because I couldn't tell it was working from day to day but when I took that after photo 7 days later I could definitely see how much brighter my skin actually was. And as always the sun screen is an added bonus.
This is a must try . This does make your face feel brighter even toned and soft as a baby's butt. This also can be worn under make up and help block sunlight . This is my new every day moisturizer .just a few things sometimes can really change your look.
"I love love this moisturizer! It's smooth and thick, so you don't need much, and it works really well. My skin is brighter on a week. I haven't used it for too long so I don't know long term effects, but the immediate ones are awesome! It's one step so it's really easy to remember after cleansing."
"I love Garnier SkinAcitive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer! After using it only a week, my skin looks and feels better than it has in years. It starts out slightly greasy, so I have to wait to put on my makeup, which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but I plan to continue using it, because even though I have to add a few minutes to my morning routine to wait for the greasy feeling to go away, the way it makes my skin look is worth it."
"I love the silky, smooth feeling of it going onto my thirsty dry skin. It absorbs in well and leaves behind a very natural, beautiful glow. My skin is so moisturized and fresh looking. I love this product. My skin looks better with each day that I use it. The dull, lackluster skin is gone. I also love the fabulous light scent and that this has SPF protection. Excellent results."
"I like the Garnier Clearly Brighter smoothing daily moisturizer spf15. I have to be honest after use Garnier Clearly Brighter Moisturizer, I didn't see a difference in my skin. I do like the scent and the texture of this moisturizer. I'm going to continue use the moisturizer and see if I get some results. I received this product free for review purposes."
"I haven't changed my daily moisterizer until this sample came to me. I was a bit unsure, but willing to take the challenge. I now am a big fan and will continue to use this product for a long time. It is a smooth lotion with an enjoyable scent. It doesn't clog pores and covers the skin with a little bit of product. My skin does look brighter and it protects well for being out in the sun. It works well under my foundation leaving a flawless look. I am very satisfied."
Since using this product my face has changed so much! I even feel beautiful more and more each day. This is all natural and face did not break out when using. Most products make my face break out and it looks worse than when I started. This product works!
I love how creamy Garnier Clearly Brighter is. It's so soft and silky. It was not too thin or thick and was airy. It didn't feel heavy. It made my skin feel soft as well as shine. And it included sunscreen so I was protected when I went outside. It was also non-irritating and didn't irritate my skin or dry me out. And I could see a difference in my complexion and skin tone after a week of use! I loved it. I did get to try this free but these are my own opinions.
"I got to try this product for free from Crowdtap and Garnier, in exchange for honest feedback. I really liked the product alot. I did the 7 day Clearly Brighter Challenge and my skin is feels so much shinier and healthier too. This product has built in SPF 15 to help with unexpected sunburns. It also gives you skin lots of hydration without the oil. I am glad to find a moisturizer that works so well."
I loved this product and have already purchased my own bottle to use. I love that my skin appeared to look brighter after a few days. The texture was softer so that my makeup went on smoother. I will continue to use this product. The only think that I would like more is to have a higher SPF than 15. It would make me feel better at protecting my skin from the sun without having to add additional spf products.
"Even though I'm giving you two stars I might still recommend it, although I think you could do better. The fragrance is pretty strong and my eyes had a reaction and no, I didn't get it close to or in my eyes. To me the strong fragrance feels cheap.On the back of the packaging under 'Uses' you say it's for sun protection when used with another sun product. Are you marketing it as a sun product or a moisturizer? You should pick one or the other; sun protection should be secondary to moisturizing."
"Both my husband and I really love this moisturizer. Our two favorite things about Clearly Brighter Moisturizer is that it is oil free and has SPF 15. We are always outside, so we like being protected. Also I have issues with break outs, so the oil free formula doesn't clog my pores."
"I was blown away what a short time it took ,Garnier smoothing & daily moisturizer spf 15 took to bring back a youthful look to my skin .No more red blotches and my pores have shrunk down . I can look in a mirror and say yeah that's right you look good !"
"I love the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer in so many ways.The lotion is easy to blend in, feels light on my skin, it doesn't feel heavy on my face so I don't feel as if my pores are getting clogged.I have used this on my face everyday after my shower. It is a nice product to help not only moisturize my face but having the SPF already in it helps me as well. One less thing to worry about!"
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is wonderful! It melts right into my skin and never leaves a greasy feeling behind. It doesn't smell unpleasant on my face and actually has a floral scent to it, not a chemical SPF smell.My skin feels soft and moisturized, and is protected from the suns harmful rays."
"I have enjoyed using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter moisturizer. It's lightweight and makes my skin look it's best. It hasn't caused any breakouts, which is a problem I've had with other moisturizers. I love that it includes sun protection to further aid my skin."
"Great moisturizer with spf! I'm terrible at remembering to use spf daily, but this makes a great way to remember. It moisturizes nicely and doesn't make my skin feel sticky like some lotions or sunscreens. It smells light and refreshing and I did notice a more brighter, even looking skin tone after continued use."
i loved garnier clearly brighter it didnt take long for it to work it makes your skin smoother and younger looking. the best thing is that it has daily mositurizer to keep your skin mosturized even in any weather. with it having sunscreen in it is great you can protect your skin and still look beatiful.
"I am loving this clearly brighter moisturizer! It has a light fresh scent, is non-greasy, and just makes my skin feel amazing and soft! I have super sensitive skin too, and had no problems at all! I have noticed over the last week that my face is almost glowing! I love this and will continue to use it everyday!"
"After taking the Clearly Brighter Challenge, my skin has never looked or felt better. My face feels soft and moisturized, illuminates and is protected from UV rays. This moisturizer goes on easily, does not leave a greasy residue and has a wonderful scent. I also love that it contains an antioxidant complex of Vitamin C and LHA. Thank you, Garnier, for introducing me to this product!"
"Nice lightweight moisturizer. Absorbed quickly with no greasy feeling. A great way to get SPF on your face without feeling like you have heavy, sticky sunscreen on. Smoother and Brighter? I'm not sure about that. My skin looks the same after taking the 7-day challenge. I'm not sure how you qualify ""smoother and brighter"" anyhow."
"Thanks to Crowdtap, I've been able to try Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I absolutely love it and couldn't be more pleased with the results so far. My friends that have tried it really like it as well. I haven't been using it very long, but I can tell already that I am definitely making the switch to Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15."
I truly love that this provides SPF protection but this is not enough for me as I am fair skinned and a red head on top of that so I require 90 SPF. I did like that I can start to see youthful bright skin after a week of use but do not like that this leaves my skin a little oily when I already have oily skin.
"Love, love love this moisturizer! It's super lightweight when you put it on, which is always a plus for me. I don't like things that feel heavy and thick on my face. The big selling point for me is that is has SPF 15 in it, so I can moisturize my face and protect it from the sun in one easy step. It has a nice, clean scent and makes my skin feel hydrated."
I'm really liking this product. I've been looking for a good moisturizer and I think I've found it in this product. My skin is visibly smoother and I'm noticing that it isn't getting as dry as it was before I started using it. I like that it doesn't feel oily and that it soaks into my skin quickly!
"I have pretty dry skin in some areas, and oily and prone to breakouts in others. I love that this moisturizer didn't irritate my skin. I did notice that the moisture doesn't last very long on my dry areas, and they seemed to get all flaky almost immediately after application. I do love that there is an SPF in this moisturizer, as that helps eliminate a step from my routine. For my skin type, I think I need something a little different, but for someone with normal skin, this would be fabulous!"
"I think this product is amazing. After using it for 7 days regularly, my skin because soft and hydrated and look very radiant. It was so hard for me to find a moisturizer that would actually make and keep my skin soft instead of dry. This Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 will be in my daily routine from now on. I will now own all Garnier products. Truly wonderful moisturizer. Thank you for the opportunity to try this product."
"I really enjoyed using this product. I could actually see the difference in my skin after just one week of using it. My skin looked brighter and felt so health. It's a great moisturizer that doesn't leave your skin feeling oily. Also, one major plus is that it also contains SPF. I'm a member of the Crowdtap Garnier Rewards Program and Garnier sent me a sample of it's SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 to review."
"I'm really glad that I was able to try out this product. I was looking for a new moisturizer and I think I may have found it. I was impressed at how quickly it was absorbed into my skin and how smooth my skin felt immediately after. While I did not notice that it cleared my skin, I did see how much brighter it got as the week progressed."
When I first tried Garnier Clearly Brighter I did like it but I found it started to pill up- ball up on my face when I put a foundation on top. However this go around I did use a different bottle and I didn't experience any of the pilling. It has made my skin more clear and I feel confident going out without makeup on more often.
"I received the Garnier Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer to try, and I used it the very next day. I always apply my face lotion right after washing my face in the morning. I really loved the feel of the lotion because it's light and not greasy at all. It felt like it gave me good coverage and absorbed into my skin quickly. It didn't just disappear though. I could tell I had used it because my skin was actually brighter and smoother. It was softer and healthier after using it for a week. I am very impressed with it."
"I liked that this product had the two benefits of SPF and long-term skin improvement. I used it on my face every day and it never irritated my skin. I can't say I've noticed any real change in my skin's texture or 'brightness', but I have been much more faithful with it than any other SPF, so I know it's preventing sun damage. I just wish the SPF was higher--at least 20, or even 30."
I really loved Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter & Smoothing Daily Mositurizer. It didn't take long at all to start seeing results and wasn't too heavy on my skin. The only recommendation I would have is stay far far away from your eyes and don't put on before a work out or something else that makes you sweat because it stings like crazy in your eyes. ** Sample provided for evaluation from Crowdtap
Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 felt silky and smooth on my skin. This product was not sticky or oily. The best thing is I noticed how much of a glow my skin showed after such a short period of time. It was such a nice feeling when others noticed a difference in my skin.
"I love how light and sheer the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF14 feels on my skin, and it smells amazing! It's the perfect moisturizer for morning, and my skin feels very soft and smooth. The only thing I miss is some sort of anti-aging benefit, but this is a great everyday moisturizer."
"I was very pleased with the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. Not only did I enjoy how soft, smooth, moisturized, & sun protected my skin has become, but I have shared my samples with my husband as well, and he loves them too! Our skin has been so much better recently!"
"I absolutely ADORE this moisturizer! It has done wonders for my skin, and in such a short frame of time! In one week, my face has gone from red, blotchy and dry to smooth, hydrated and one tone. The red is gone. My breakouts are practically diminished, and I really do think I actually see a glow! I really believe I have found my go to facial moisturizer."
"This moisterizer is really good, i cant really say its the best one ive used because i dont normally use moisterizers but this one was nice. It left my skin glowing, not sticky, and not gooey. It made my skin moisterized enough but not too much, it was just the right amount. I use this under my foundation and let it set into my skin before applying the foundation over it. It works great"
I thought the Garnier Clearly Brighter Challenge was great and easy. I like doing it because I noticed the difference on my face. Having to monitor the spot to see if the moisturizer was working made it so much more noticeable. I noticed in the week my spots started getting lighter and my skin on face was smoother. I also liked that it didn't burn my sensitive skin. I will continue to use it on my face.
I was very excited to try this moisturizer especially because I have been in the market for a new one. The very first thing and major drawback for me personally was the scent. VERY strong and overwhelming for the face. I found myself not wanting to put it on simply for that reason. As far as the effects of the moisturizer it definitely made my face smoother. Its very soft and I love it. I would recommend this to some one if perhaps Garnier came out with an unscented or lightly scented version.
"After using the product for a week, I did notice my skin was smoother. I used it before spending time outside and my skin was protected. It does have a slight residue that can be difficult to remove from your hands but otherwise, a great face product!"
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 worked very well on my face but it didn't exactly brighten it like I hoped. I tried it out for a few weeks and hoped it would work and still using it but so far, my skin is still uneven and not brightened at all. It softened my skin so that is a plus."
"I love everything about this moisturizer. It comes in a nicely decorated bottle to begin with. The moisturizer itself isn't too oily at all, and is very easy to rub in. The scent is light and not too heavy, but it does smell better than sunscreen. Overall, it's very pleasant."
"Clearly Brighter accomplishes just what the name says it will: clearly brighter skin! And in just ONE week! There are only things to love about this new line from Garnier. It's smooth and soft, leaving your skin perfectly nourished and moist. It smells heavenly and my husband can't help but smile every time he smells it on my face."
"My new favorite! This moisturizer goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, and isn't heavily scented - all of which add up to a dream come true! Add in the fact that it has SPF 15 protection and it really is the total package. I have definitely notice my skin is smoother and brighter after using it for about two weeks. I actually took a photo of my skin after removing my makeup and my skin looks as good as when I have my makeup on! This one is a keeper!"
"Overall I really like this product. I wish it wasn't scented but my only real complaint is that when I sweat it runs into my eyes and burns. I just wouldn't wear it while exercising. Otherwise it's great for everyday and has spf in it which I love! It goes on smooth, dries quick, and doesn't leave me feeling greasy!"
"It works really well, and it is super affordable in stores and super easy to find. I like the consitency it was super easy to apply, and absorbed quickly and didn't clog pores. I love how it doesn't smell awful. I love how it isn't too thick, I love how it protects and keeps skin soft at the same time, so It is versatile."
"I really liked this campaign. My 11 friends were delighted to receive the samples, and all gave high reviews of the product. They, like me, loved the scent and how it went on smoothly. One sampler said she rubbed it on her arms as well. She works outside, and said she appreciated the coverage. Many of them did not know that Garnier had a new moisturizer out on the market. This really helps to get the word out on new, and amazing product."
The second I applied this to my face I instantly felt smoother softer skin and the longer I used it the more fabulous and bright my skin got. I have really become attached to using this and it's a permanent staple in my skincare routine. I have oily skin and this didn't make my skin greasy at all.
"I have combination skin and find it challenging to find the right products for my face. I'll admit, I wasn't sure this product would work but after taking the challenge I can clearly see a difference in how bright my skin is. I haven't been using foundation either which is another bonus! And one added bonus is, this moisturizer has SPF but doesn't smell like sunblock the way many moisturizers with SPF do. I'm really glad I took the challenge! I've even been handing out samples to my friends :)"
"I love Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It makes my skin feel so soft, smooth and hydrated. It is lightweight and not greasy at all. It moisturizes really well. I love using it everyday. The SPF is an added bonus."
"Immediately after using the product for the first time, my skin felt super smooth and soft. I have dry patches on my face, and I usually use my regular lotion to keep said dry skin at bay during the day, but with this moisturizer, I did not have to reapply for HOURS. That's huge for me. My only con is the scent, I'm sensitive to that sort of thing, but it wasn't too bad and did not deter me from reapplying."
"I love Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter moisturizer. I've been wearing it under my makeup for a week. Its very lightweight and hasn't cause any breakouts. My skin is soft and is a little brighter. I will keep wearing it to see if my skin gets better. I've been going through a lot of stress and was looking very haggard, so this moisturizer is fighting against a lot right now."
"To start with firstly no debut smell is very refreshing. After applying the moisturizer it is light and fell hydrating to face which is very impotent to me because I have very dry and flaky skin with some red spots. When I apply first Time it feel good.and It gave cool fresh fell to me.it gave my skin glow ,make it bright and it has SPF 15. I like this very much and in summer time its my must have.I got it as a sample but I am surly purchase it again."
"I really LOVED getting to do this challenge. I really noticed a difference in my skin, it was more even and seemed to exude more life than it normally does. It worked well on my sensitive skin and it is something that I will continue to use in place of my normal moisturizer."
"I have found a new moisturizer for my face! Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer not only has SPF15 but also Vitamins C & E but makes my rough, dry skin soft and polished looking. I love that it's not greasy and smells great!"
"I absolutely love this moisturizer! For me, it really does take away the dry spots, even out the skin tones, simmer down the darker spots, and seriously add a glow to my face! In fact, I see a glow there that I have not seen is so very long. It is my go to in the morning, and my go to right before I go to bed. In fact, it has become my main moisturizer. I do not have a dry skin issue anymore, and my appearance is where I want it. Even more, it has sun protection in it."
"I admit that I was a little skeptical when I began the Clearly Brighter Challenge by trying Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 for one week. However, I was very pleased with the results, it really does brighten your skin and make it smoother! While after a week difference isn't astronomical, it IS noticeable and with continued and regular usage I think it will improve my skin greatly. Thank you, Garnier! I'll definitely purchase more in the future."
"After taking the Clearly Brighter Challenge for 1 week, I was pleasantly surprised how my all over redness diminished and my skin has a brand new glow! Each day I seen an improvement in my skins color and texture. Now my face is visibly free from redness and baby soft! I also enjoy the fresh scent of the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15, it smells amazing! I've never found a moisturizer that has given me the results that Garnier has, it's truly amazing!"
This product is good for anyone who needs a moisturizer and skin protection. I used it for a week and it works amazing. Makes my skin smoother and also softer and it smells so good. I received this product for free for the purpose of my unbiased review.
"I'm only a few days in to using the product, so I can't attest to long term brightening results; however, I really am loving it so far. It goes on with a thin coverage that doesn't leave skin feeling goopy or greasy, but still provides enough moisture for my dry skin. I will definitely continue to use in the future."
I'm pleasantly surprised by this product. It really works well in brightening and smooting. It clearly delivers what it is promising. I have never used anything that made my skin brighter and this little wonder just made it happen. I love how my skin feels but mostly look now! So hydrated. Great job Garnier and thank you for giving me the opportunity to try.
"I love this Moisturizer because it has SPF 15 in it. It works well on my face and neck. It is so easy to apply. It goes on very light. It is not greasy. It has very light smell to it. 5 star product in my eyes. I will be telling all my friends and family members about this great Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. So, they can try it also. It also has Vitamin C in it. I will be buying it to use. I received this product from Crowdtap to try for free for my honest and unbiased review."
A revolutionary product. Not only is this a face lotion it contains vitamin c and LHA to help brighten your skin with daily use. It also has SPF15 so you don't forget to wear your sunscreen. The lotion absorbs easily and is basically scent free. My skin was glowing after 1 week of use.
"I'm very pleasantly surprised! The advertisement said clearly brighter skin in one week, Garnier did not disappoint! The clearly brighter challenge did give me brighter, better looking skin in 7 days. I absolutely loved the scent too. Finally a facial moisturizer that contains spf, but doesn't feel oily or heavy on your skin! Awesome!"
"I absolutely love the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily moisturizer. I have been applying it daily to my skin. My skin looks and feels soft and smooth. I like the scent, its the right amount, not overpowering. It absorbs really fast in the skin and isn't greasy. I also love that it contain SPF15 sun block and still brightens your skin.. This is a great daily skin moisturizer."
I tried the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter challenge and loved the results!! Many mositurizers leave my face greasy and make them break out. This mositurizer did not. It left my skin feeling smooth. It really did seem like it was clearer and brighter. My dark circles seemed to diminish.
I enjoyed using Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 and it is a part of my daily routine now. This is an amazing moisturizer which makes my skin feel so smooth and brings out a natural glow on my face. I use it before make up and my makeup blends in so well. Love this product. Thank you Garnier :)
"Having normally very dry skin and not using a daily moisturizer on a regular basis, then trying this particular brand has made a huge difference in my daily routine. I will continue to use this first thing in the morning and throughout the day (as needed) to keep my skin looking very healthy and moistened. I no longer have dry skin flakes all over my face. No wrinkles are even filling in!"

"I received a free sample of Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15, these are my opinions regarding this product and how it worked for me. I liked the floral fruity smell, and I also liked that I rub the moisturizer in and my skin does not feel oily, it is smooth and I have to say I have notice a brighter, even skin tone. I typically use coconut oil, but I have to say I will now incorporate this moisturizer into my daily routine. I'm glad I took the 7 day Clearly Brighter Challenge."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 absorbs instantly into my skin, It deeply hydrates without feeling greasy or heavy. My skin is no longer tired looking, it is bright and healthy looking and very soft. The daily moisturizer has a light, refreshing scent that does not linger long on the skin.

Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter & Smoothing daily moisturiser with spf15 worked so well. my skin is clearer and protected from the sun. i love this product an will be buying it regularly. great prices and has a great smell. rubs on good. not sticky or oily i love it.
"I feel that this is an instant pick me up for my face!I love that in a day I noticed my face looked and felt softer.And,after a week as promised it has a beautiful glow.I will be buying this definitely and I have talked about this to friends and family members."
"I really like how Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 makes my skin look and feel healthier. I like how I can put it on and it not only helps my skin look healthier, but it also helps protect it from the sun, in 1 easy step I am doing something good for my skin that achieves multiple results."
"This product was a bit misleading to me since it is advertised as a skin brightening moisturizer but all the ingredients listed are sunscreens. I just dont believe a sunscreen is going to help moisturize my face and make it too much brighter.This product was easy to apply to the face, it was very smooth and creamy. The scent was also nice. I was not able to continue applying to my forehead because my skin seemed to get irritated by the product.Overall, it was not the type of product I expected by the name."
"This moisturizer has a nice citrus, floral fresh smell to it and feels lightweight and absorbs quickly into the skin. I use under my makeup without any issues but also just put it on before heading outside even without makeup. Has an SPF of 15 which is great to help block some of the sun's rays! I love that my skin feels soft and moisturized all day."
"I love that this lotion is creamy, but goes on sheer and smooth. I appreciate the SPF, that it's oil free, and the soft scent as well. I'm really happy with how much brighter and more even my skin looks! I pretty much love everything about this moisturizer. Best of all, I saw a difference in my skin within three days. I'll definitely keep using this product!"
"I loved Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15! This is my perfect summer go-to right now. I love how my skin is so much more smooth and soft, but also more even. This is a great product wich I will be using everyday!"
"I received Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 for free to try from Crowdtap. I was pleasantly surprised how it made my skin feel. It went on smoothly, absorbed quickly and had no greasy feel. It made my skin brighter and smoother after just a few times of using it. I would recommend Clearly Brighter to my friends and family."
"If you want brighter, smoother and healthier looking skin in just one week (better with continued use!), then you should give this product a shot! It smells nice, feels soft and silky upon application and doesn't make you break out. It also has SPF 15 to help prevent future sun damage and wrinkles. Did I mention it starts to work in one week?!! I just wish that it were a little more moisturizing for us gals with dry skin."
"I was incredibly surprised when I first used Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It went on smooth, and was easy to massage in to my skin. It did not feel heavy, which is why I end up stopping moisturizer normally. It was very light weight. It made my face feel really soft, and I liked the peace of mind that it has SPF for every day wear."
"I really like Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15! It makes my skin feel smooth, look radiant, and gives it sun protection unlike my other moisturizers. My only complaint is that the smells reminds me too much of sunscreen and is a turnoff for using the product. If it was fragrant free I'd definitely purchase Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 on my own!"
"I received this product complimentary to test from garnier and allure beauty, I did a 7 day trial with this product and I definitely noticed a difference! Not only did it leave my skin a lot softer and smoother, it helped calm down my rosacea and even out my skin tone! Plus I love any mosturizer that has SPF in it!"
"I got the opportunity to try this product out thanks to Garnier and Allure Beauty Enthusiasts. This face moisturizer became my favorite right away! I love how lightweight it feels on my skin yet hydrates it nicely. It gave my skin that healthy, dewy almost like finish and also works great as a makeup base. I love the easy to work with pump and citrusy scent is the bomb!"
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter is the perfect moisturizer for my face. It's light, never too heavy or greasy. Yet it moisturizes deeply. It also has SPF 15 to protect my fair skin from the sun which is very important to me. Overall it is a great product that I hope I'll never be without!"
"I actually really like this moisturizer, which is kind of rare for me. I have only ever bought one brand consistently (Acure) but this seems to work almost as well. It has a very pleasant texture that goes into your skin super smooth and it doesn't leave your face feeling oily. I love that it also is a sunscreen because normally sunscreen causes my face to break out, but this did not, it will be great for summer."
I absolutely loved this product!! I have sensitive skin so sometimes it's hard finding a product that won't break me out but this product did the complete opposite it left my skin feeling soft and shiny. A huge plus is that it contains spf 15 for those sunny days. I will definitely be purchasing this product again.
"I like it in that it smells OK and hasn't made me break out so far. However, I haven't noticed a difference in my skin. I had been using a similar Aveeno product so that could be why. Perhaps they are both equally effective? If that's the case then I'll go with price & company I like the best."
Garnier's Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 feels great on my face. It is light and not greasy. It absorbs well and moisturizes well too without being heavy. My only drawback is that it is too scented. I wish it were fragrance free.
I love the feel of my skin after I used garnier skin active clearly brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer. the smell and feel is very fresh and new age. Would definitely recommend this product. Thank you for allowing me to test it out.
"I have enjoyed using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 for the past week. I would buy a full size bottle to try it out for a little longer. If it's still working as well as it is now after that time, I'd switch to this brand of moisturizer."
I love this Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 that I got to try thanks to crowdtap! It makes my skin so much more smooth and bright. I love the bright polished look it gives my skin. It is truly amazing and I would recommend it to anyone!
When i used the mostiturizer i could feel it working right away imroving my skin. I love the smell of the lotion as well. After using for just one week i have noticed a differnce in the look and feel of my skin. I feel way more confindent in my own skin. My skin is brighter and imprefections are less noticable.
One of the best moisturizers I have ever used. I normally never buy moisturizers for my skin even thought it dry in warmer months because I hate the feel of sticky skin especially under my makeup for the day. I highly recommend this product it is gentle on your skin and Garnier SkinActive Brighter Daily Moisturizer is perfect for using everyday and the SPF makes it worth using everyday.
"This lotion really does it all. The scent is fresh and sweet, but not overpowering, it gives sun protection while nourishing and hydrating my skin, and in a week, it got rid of uneven spots and my skin seems healthier and more even. This is my new daily face moisturizer."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer works great at preventing sunburn and sun damage to my skin. It works well at moisturizing my skin too. I like that it is oil free too. After using it for only a week, my skin looked and felt great."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is an awesome find. It goes on weightless, absorbs quickly, leaves your skin feeling velvety smooth; all while evening skintone and providing sun protection as well. You really do see a change in your skin in as little as one week! I received samples of this product in exchange for my unbiased opinion."
"This Moisturizer is wonderful! When I use other moisturizer it tends to make me break out on my forehead. This does not! Plus, I have this annoying red skin on my chin that this seems to take away, which is awesome. I'm hooked on this stuff! I've finally found a moisturizer I love."
"Love I can use as a primer, moisturizer and sunscreen protection. It's not heavy or sticky. Most products I have tried previous to this one have left my hands sticky, face sticky and it's not messy and easy to use! I love love I've this product. Definitely recommend and it has gotten my skin a lot more of a natural looking flow."
I have been using Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 for over a week now and I'm very happy with the results. My skin feels smooth and soft. I don't have to wear foundation everyday. My skin tone on my face has evened out and looks healthy. I love this product. It is replacing my old moisturizer!
"If used diligently this product works and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg. I just turned 65 and am loving it and my daughter who is 38 with oilier skin loves it just as much. We both love the light touch, the way it absorbs quickly and has a fresh smell."
I have used Garnier Clearly Brighter for a week now and have to say it is one of my favorite multi-tasking moisturizers. I love the fact that it is a moisturizer and a sunscreen and that it has so many skin loving vitamins. My skin definitely does have a brighter look! Great product!
"I am a believer!!! This product from Garnier has made my skin so beautiful. It is bright, soft, healthy, and my dark spots have gone away. I look amazing! I am so happy with my results that I am constantly telling my friends and family about Skin Active. They can't believe the difference."
"This absorbs super-quickly. It has a nice clean fragrance that's not too strong. I love having a daily moisturizer that has SPF, as my dermatologist recommends. I don't have to worry about sun protection or wrinkles. This leaves my face moisturized all day. I absolutely love it!"
"The Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is awesome. I love it because after I use my other moisturizer I would put my concealer on and my skin would feel dry and it wouldn't go on smooth. With this my concealer glides on like butter, the soft good kind. It makes my skin feel nice and hydrated."
"I love this new moisturizer by Garnier! It really helps to make my face look and feel so much better! I tend to have red blotchy skin, and I love how this moisturizer helps to lock in moisture and make my skin look less red and irritated. I also like the scent, which helps when applying the moisturizer to my skin."
Garnier clearly brighter brightening &smoothing daily moisturizer.It clearly went along way.I applied on Facebook and neck every morning.I notice my dry patch around eye brows were no longer visibly.The itch was gone.My skin is smoother and softer.It now has a glow to it.
"Garnier's Clearly brighter Brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer is amazing! It gave me fast results literally within 24 hours, My face looks more vibrant and fresh than it has in the past and it's crazy to think that this moisturizer can do it's magic so quickly, another thing that love about this product is it doesn't go on greasy! It feels sheer and doesn't block my pores."
After taking the Clearly Brighter Challenge I am sold on this new product from Garnier. I used this product for one week and could see a remarkable difference in my skin texture and tone. I had red patchy skin and now I can see it diminishing. I would encourage others to do the same challenge. Take a picture on day one of the challenge and on the last day as well. You will see the difference. I was pleasantly surprised how much I saw when i did this challenge.
"I adore the immediate and long term results from using Garnier Clearly Brighter. At one use there is noticeable softness and brightness and after a few weeks skin is smooth and glowing. I truly have never used a product- drug store or department store- that left my skin looking more fresh and lovely bare than with makeup. I am so impressed as is everyone I have shared samples with. This not only improved my face skin, but also my decollate!"
"I love Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. Not only did it do exactly as it was advertised, it did not clog my pores! The moisturizer itself has a pleasant floral smell to it that slightly lingers. It also does not have any affect on my powder foundation that I apply afterwards. No clumps!!"
"My skin did seem brighter and hydrated at times. however, i found if i used product everyday or multiple times a day it dried out my skin. it seemed to work better if i used every other day. I also found the fragrance pleasant, but a little too strong to be putting on my face. to my surprise i found my boyfriend using the product. He liked it and did not mind the fragrance, so i guess it could be shared among the family."
Garnier skinactive clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer with spf15 is light a lush. The barely there fragrance makes it perfect without overpowering. It makes my skin glow and super soft without being greasy. The spf 15 helps me to be able to get out and decorate for spring without having to worry about sunburn! Perfect moisturizer!! I love it! Thanks crowdtap & Garnier!!
I was unable to continue use past two day's with product on my face. My sensitive skin was reactive to the lotion. I However have extremely dry skin on my hands. This has made them look aged. First application of this product had my skin on hands glowing. It even helped remove some of the dry patches of skin in that area. I was very excited by the change in the look and feel of my hands after using product for six days.
"This is one of the best daily moisturizer that I have used. From day 1, I have seen result, unlike other brands. I will continue using Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I got this for free from Crowdtap for my my honest review."
"Gardiner SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 keeps my skin feeling soft and healthier than ever.

Overall, this is the best moisturizer I have used."
"I loved this product! It made my face feel so soft and smooth and radiant! I've struggled with adult acne for years, so I've been hesitant to try new products, especially moisturizer. I was shocked to see how this product actually improved my acne and made my complexion super smooth and soft. I never liked to touch my face before, but now it's so smooth and pretty that I can't help it!"
"This is a great, lightweight moisturizer that hydrates the skin during the day. I love that it has an SPF 15 in it since I can be out in the sun quite a bit. It doesn't have a strong scent and it feels nice. It made my face seem a bit brighter and radiant after using for a week."
I received this product from Allure Beauty Enthusiasts and Garnier for review. I have been using for 1 week and absolutely love the look and feel of my skin.

I have a combination skin which is oily on the T-zone and dry on some areas under the eyes and cheeks. Using this product has balanced my skin tone. I also love that it has a fresh scent and reminds me of spring time. It doesn't leave any residue and there's no greasy feel to it, as well."
"Right after the first use I could tell I would like this product. It didn't feel oily or leave a residue, yet it made my skin feel so soft. After several days I could notice a better complexion if you will. My skin had a bit more glow to it and it felt great. Not to mention the SPF15 makes exposure to the sun less threatening for your skin."

Garner skin active clearly brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer is a great moisturizer. It feels like on my skin when I put it on! It does feel a tad bit oily at first on my face but then drys rather well. It is not my favorite moisturizer to wear under makeup makes my makeup feel a little oily I like a moisturizer that is kind of creamy and light weight. I like this one more of a night time moisturizer. I haven't seen much of a difference in my face like I thought I would. But I'm going to keep using a see what happens!
"I would absolutely recommend Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 to anybody wanting to know about a skin care routine.

I loved the way this lotion felt and the way it made my skin look. It had a nice creamy texture that felt great to put on my face. I hate when a lotion feels like its clogging up my pores the moment i put it on my skin and this didn't have that effect on me. I like that it had the spf in it because i am really bad about putting any kind of sun tan lotion on before i go out for the day. I think all around it was just a nice feel and i think i am going to continue to use it. i think i have found a new lotion for my everyday routine.
"Garnier clearly brighter moisturizer works great to make my skin glows and my skin the is brighter after a week of daily use, my face looks smooth and shine, the darkness is imoroved, and it has spf15, so I don't need to wear extra sunscreen, it is really convenient and effective."

It really does make the skin appear to be brighter and smoother and softens the appearance of fine line and wrinkles.

I highly recommend it! Your skin will love you for it! #ActiveIsBetter #GarnierCrowd #sponsored"

It contains SPF which is a definite plus. I liked the very mild scent, it smelled like pears to me which was refreshing and not too overbearing.

My dry cheeks were so much better after using Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 in less than a week. I wasn't worked about being out in the sun because it has SPF15 in it. The smell & texture of this lotion is very nice.
I love the way my son felt after I used it. The fact that it wasn't so heavy that I could use it throughout the day was great! It was light and didn't leave an oily residue.

My favorite aspect of Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is that it contains SPF15. That is one less thing that I have to spend time worrying about. I know that Garnier has me covered. My skin is much smoother now after just a week of use. I love the light spring-like fragrance and that it is not too thick. I hate thick pore clogging creams. I believe early use will help slow down the aging process.
I definitely definitely will recommend it to friends and family. It has really helped my skin to breath and have the glow as i wanted.most importantly if its put on top of your makeup it doesnt make your face sticky or dirty. ITs a must have if you plan to go to beaches and around or plan to step out @sun..
this moisturizer is all in one. It has Spf protection and contains anti-aging products. That is not all it also contains Vitamin C which helps brightens the skin. I am so amazed on how it makes my skin bright after 1 week of using and my husband notices it.

I have to admit...I was skeptical at first because I have never heard of a brightening moisturizer before.I was so wrong!My skin is not only smooth but it really has a glow to it now that I never had before.The SPF 15 is a great bonus! This is the best daily moisturizer I have ever used and I made sure to spread the benefits and recommend this product to all my family and friends. Thank you Garnier for giving my skin a new life and look!

It's not sticky and the best thing is not oily at all...I liked the smell of the Garnier moisturizer too. This gives me confidence too.I got the opportunity to try the Garnier clearly brightening & smoothing moisturizer through crowdtap. Loved the product. :)
"After taking the Clearly Brighter Challenge I felt more confident in purchasing products made by Garnier.

This was a much better experience than I have had with more expensive moisturizers. I also love the added bonus of the SPF15. I would recommend this moisturizer to ABSOLUTELY anyone looking to make a switch to something that actually makes a difference."
"I love Garnier SkinActive! It's everything that I've been looking for in a facial moisturizer. It moisturizes my face, making me feel fresh and smooth, it has an SPF, which is super important because I live in a sunny climate, and it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy at all! What a great product!"
I have tried several Garnier products in the past and this was by far the best! I love that it doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy but does moisturize. It is also great that it has a little sunscreen so you don't have to worry when you go out to the store or anything. I also enjoyed the smell. It was strong but it was just right for this product.
My skin is very oily and hate products with oil in it. Well this product is oil free. I love that it just not make your skin brighter but it moisturize too on top or protecting your skin from the hot sun on summer days. I recommend this to my sister And my mother. They both also tried it and loved it.
"I got a free sample of Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer and I would have to say that I am pretty satisfied with it, it lightened my dark under eye circles and I had Sun age spots that it lightened up as well."
I was skeptical that a moisturizer could brighten my skin as I've been disappointed before. Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer exceeded my expectations. I love that it is oil-free and contains SPF15. My skin is brighter and is significantly smoother. It also moisturized very well. The moisturizer is thick yet glides on the skin and feels like a fluid when spread. I will definitely purchase this again in the future.

I also loved how it felt on my skin-sometimes I think moisturizers are too greasy, and this one was perfect! I will be using Garnier Clearly Brighter Moisturizer in the future!"
"I love how Garnier Clearly Brighter moisturizer is hydrating, but doesn't get greasy. It also protects from sun with some spf. I wish that there were no fragrance in the moisturizer, because it makes any flare ups of sensitive skin sting. Otherwise it is great."
"I LOVE this moisturizer, I will continue to use this for a long time. It definitley made a difference in my skin in just one week. My skin is brighter, smoother, and so soft now. It really feels hydrated. This moisturizer also smells amazing, which is just an added bonus! I will recommend this to all of my family & friends to try!"

Also it has a great smell that doesn't bother. I would totally recommend this mosturizer to anyone looking for smooth skin, brighter skin, and SPF."
I love the garnier brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer. I can now use this one product in lieu of 3 other products I had been using. I have been using it for about a week and already see a noticeable difference in my skin. I will never use anything else and I recommend this to all my friends!!

You'll feel refreshed, clean, moisturized and protected with the SPF15 that inside that magical little bottle"
I love this!! It leaves my face so smooth! It's lightweight and not greasy at all. Not to mention it helps my makeup stay in place. I was scared at first because I have super sensitive skin but I did not break out in pimples or anything.. This truly left my face so hydrated! I love it
"This is a great moisturizer if you are looking to get your SPF in everyday without the heavy feel of a thick cream. It is light. It doesn't make you greasy. It is oil free. It doesn't smell bad. I have only been using a few days so I will see how much ""brighter"" it makes my skin. So far no break outs from it. This would be good in the summer."
"I love Garnier Clearly Brighter Moisturizer!! This is an awesome product! I love how much smoother and brighter my skin feels and looks. I have problem skin so its hard to find a moisturizer that doesn't cause break outs, but this worked perfectly!! It's oil free, very light weight and made my skin feel dreamy!!!"
"I thought this product was really great! It was easy to put on, smooth and simple. It dried on my face in a couple minutes, leaving a smooth, soft feeling. My skin felt refreshed and looked almost glowing. It didn't leave a sticky residue or that gross lotion feeling. And, it was cool and helped hydrate my skin."
I love the Garnier Brightener and Smoothing moisturizer! It is not too oily and goes on smoothly. My skin feel moisturized and more radiant after I put it on. I have been using for a week now and noticed a difference in my skin by the texture and more of a glow. I love it!
"This product is amazing. It provides the moisture my skin needs, with the SPF protection it deserves-without making my skin oily. It has a pleasant light scent, which I've found to be energizing first thing in the morning. It has decreased the redness in my forehead and cheeks, and really made my skin tone even. No more flaky skin! I would recommend this product to everyone!"
"I thought this product worked well in clearing up my dry skin. I live in Michigan and between wind, rain, snow, heat and other elements, it is hard for me to find a moisturizer that works and also contains sunscreen. I will for sure buy this again and am very greatful I got to sample it free first."
it was nice and creamy on my face but it had a smell to it that lingered for most of the day. after the 7 days i didn't really notice a difference in my complexion. the best thing that i liked about it was the spf15. it saved me a step in the morning.
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth, all while protecting it from the damaging rays of the sun. I also like that fact that it has a light scent and that I can use it every day."
"I was given this by Self magazine to try!! Clearly Brighter is an oil free moisturizer! It has vitamin C, LHA, sunscreen included(huge plus) and Antioxidant Complex It worked great under my makeup! I would definitely buy it & recommend it. My skin loved it and was brighter after a week"
I'm absolutely in love with this product. I have just started worrying about my skin as I am turning 30 this year. And this is by far the best product I've tried. It makes your skin so smooth and soft and it makes it look so much healthier. Its my new addiction! Thank you for making such an amazeballs product!
From the very first time I started using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 I knew it was going to work wonders! Little did I know it'd be even better than I expected! My skin hasn't looked this good in years! It even helped clear up my acne!
"I enjoy Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It doesn't clog my pores and doesn't feel heavy on my skin. It goes on evenly and stays put, doesn't sweat off. I also like that it doesn't have a strong scent. It didn't make me break out which a lot of moisturizers tend to do. I would keep buying this product."
I absolutely love this daily moisturizer. My face is always dry and this makes my skin feel so smooth and hydrated. Its doesnt feel greasy or heavy on your skin like some other lotions. Its smells great and does everything it says it does. And the added bonus is it has spf 15 so your protecting your skin at the same time. Love it and so does everyone that I know who have tried it.
"I don't know if I notice any noticeable difference with my skin complexion from over the last week of use. However, I'd like to think it's doing something good. I like the light fragrance and texture of the daily moisturiser. I like that it's also oil-free."
"I really like how this is light on my skin, and moisturizes without feeling greasy or oily. It's perfect for right after the shower when you have that tight skin feeling. Adding SPF 15 to the mix just makes it all the better. Even when you don't think you need a heavy SPF sunscreen on, it;s ALWAYS a good idea to protect your face from the rays. It's the only face you have."
Immediately after my first application of clearly brighter I could see the difference in my skin! But then as the days went by it just kept getting better and better! I would definitely recommend Garnier clearly brighter to anyone looking for a good daily moisturizer!
"I love this moisturizer so much. I received Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brigtening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 for free to sample and my opinions are 100% my own. This moisturizer is easy to apply, leaves my faces feeling and looking great."
"I like the fact that there is spf in this lotion. I live in a sunny area and need spf every day. I don't like the smell of the lotion, it smells to much like sunscreen and unfortunately it was greasy like sunscreen. As for smoothing and brightening it didn't really do that. I think it should be marketed for a face sunscreen."
Using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 my skin feel brighter and smoother but not greasy. It's good to know that I am wearing a moisturizer that also has SPF15. There are antioxidant vitamins and my skin feels healthier.
"I really enjoyed sampling Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. The product smells nice, is not oily or thick going on - it is nice a silky feeling, actually works at moisturizing and brightening the skin as the title states, and it also has SPF 15 so I am protected from the sun. I love this product!"
"After taking the Clearly Brighter Challenge and using the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15, I have found a new addition to my everyday routine!! The moisturizer is so light and natural feeling, makes my face so smooth and makes me look more awake every single morning. I love the all day protection from the added SPF 15 too!"
"I absolutely live this product. It has a light texture and feel and you can hardly its on. It also spreads easily and leaves your skin feeling really soft. After just one week, a dark spot on my cheek seemed less noticeable. This is wonderful since I am very self conscious about that spot."
This moisturizer definitely smooths out skin texture. I have a lot of rough spots on my forehead and they are so smooth now. The moisturizer sinks into your skin and doesn't sit on top. I put it on morning and night after cleansing and my face feels so smooth I cannot stop touching it! Love the scent as well and I love that it has SPF in it. That is one less step I need to remember when going out into the sun.
"I love this product. I was getting dark spots around my forehead and after taking the Garnier Clearly Brighter challenge the spots were gone .I was amazed about how fast it worked.I have already recommended it to my friends,and gave some samples to my family and friends and told them to take the challenge and see for themselves, that it does work. It also made my face feel smooth and gave me a brighter complexion."
I loved the great feeling it left on my face so light weight smells good it was very moisturizing on my face and I also left a non-greasy Feeling I love how it was not greasy like sunblock is usually is and was very moisturizing on my face n even bright up my face a little
I wasnt expecting much out of this Moisturizer when I was selected from Crowdtap to try it for free in exchange for my honest review of it. Products claim to do things all the time do the they rarely deliver: until now. This Garnier MoisturiEr has a fresh scent to it and a nice thick consistency . It isn't oily nor does it leave an oily residue on your face. It blends it nicely and left my fave f
I received this product to try. I never really believed the hype about skin brightening moisturizers but was pretty pleased with this! My skin did feel smoother and looked brighter after consistent use. Plus it smells fantastic! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have been using Garnier Moisturizer for a couple days now. It made my skin look absolutely radiant. I'm loving it. I love how it makes my skin feel and look. I also love how it has spf in it. Going to keep using it everyday. It is now apart of my everyday regimen!
Garnier Skinactive Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer is amazing! It has such a lightweight feel so breathable which is amazing because most moisturizers with spf in them usually feel like a heavy mask on the skin. This one doesn't it's airy and helps protect your beautiful skin from the hazards of the sun.
"This is a wonderful product, all around. From the consistency to the smell. It absorbs very wel into your skin, not leaving behind an oily feel. It has a very fresh awakening aroma to it. I like that its not extremely thick, makes for applying much easier."
Loving the citrus scent and how lightweight this moisturizer is! It feels great on the skin :) However I have oily combination skin that tends to get shiny throughout the day and this doesn't help with that. It's better suited for those with dry skin.
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is one of my new favorite beauty products. I love that it provides my skin hydration while also brightening and smoothing my skin texture, and offering sun protection at the same time. I use this every morning under my makeup and it goes on easily and absorbs well and provides a good base for my other makeup products."
"This product is great for those who need a moisturizing and a sun protector in one! Thick texture with a creamy consistency that is easy to rub in. Does not leave my face feeling greasy, which is a major plus! Will definitely be using this all year round!"

Right away you feel the effect from this product. I couldn't stop touching my face! It was so smooth! I love this stuff!"
I absolutely love the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I've tried so many different moisturizers and this one is not greasy and just makes your skin feel so smooth. It doesn't interfere with my makeup either. I'm so happy I was able to give out some samples to friends and try this for free. One product I'm highly reccomending.
I love this moisturizer! It is the perfect amount of everything. It doesn't over oil my skin. It is the perfect amount of moisture. It makes my skin feel so healthy within just a few days of using it. It's the perfect moisturizer! I love it! I received complimentary Samples to review.
I really Like that it has spf and it reacted very well with my skin. I love the sample size I received because It was enough for me to share with a few close friends and family. I also like that I noticed my skin begin to look and feel better. I use to get some dry skin around my nose and on the sides as well ad on one of my eye brows and now its not really dry at all. I am really liking the way my skin looks fresher as well. It does have a nice smell but can be a little over powering for some people I was a little in different about it.
I enjoy this product. I noticed that my skin felt my hydrated. It didn't give that oily look you get with most moisturizers. I shared samples my my friends and sisters they are going to do the challenge also. Thanks for the opportunity to try brightening and smoothing challenge.
I have seen the dull side of my skin until I was able to try out Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 which has made my skin brighter more full of life leaving my skin moisturized and looking it's best I have tried other products in the past but I will never go back because Garnier has proven to turn dull into brighter with this product I am looking my best !!
"Thus skin moisturizer is perfect for someone who is outside and active, but wants to pamper their faces. It contains SPF to protect you from the harmful sun rays, while making your face nice and smooth and remain youthful. It's easy to apply and you could use it anytime."
"I was really pleased with the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I took it with me as my moisturizer on a trip to California and even though I drove 16 hours over 3 days, attended a birthday party, and an Easter party and then had to go to work until midnight, the day we came back - this was up to the challenge."
Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a great product. I felt like my skin was visibly brighter and smoother after using the moisturizer for a week. This product kept my skin from drying out. The scent is amazing. I also loved the fact that this moisturizer provided SPF unlike common moisturizers I have been using in the past.
I really love how soft and younger my face looks after I use this product. I also love that it has SPF 15 in it so I don't have to worry about sunscreen in the morning. I will be using this product from now on. I received it free in exchange for my honest opinion.
"The Clearly Brighter moisturizer actually helped to improve the texture of my skin in just a week! I didn't really notice a change in the evenness of the tone of my skin, however. I really love that it contains SPF as well, since I want to protect my skin year-round!"
"To start I love that it has a nice light, fresh scent. A little goes a long way to cover your entire face. With the first use my face felt incredibly soft and smooth. As I continue using it I notice the tone of my skin is getting more and more even. My skin is also getting brighter. It feels very light on your face. Your skin will look better in one week! I love that it's a multi-tasking product!!"
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a nice facial moisturizer. It has a light, pleasant neutral scent. It goes on smooth (more like a lotion) and leaves my skin moisturized but not feeling oily which I really like since I'm prone to acne breakouts. I love that it has an SPF15 included so I know I have light protection from the sun any time I am wearing it. The moisturizer I was using prior to this one did not have an SPF. I would definitely recommend giving this one a try."
"I love it, my skin looks and feels so much better, my neighbor asked me what did I do, did I get a facial, my skin looks really good. I let her know about Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter , I gave her a sample to enjoy so she can have beautiful skin as well."
This is a great product. It is just the right amount of sunscreen to keep your face safe from harmful rays. I am surprised with the sunscreen in it how light it feels on your face. I love the great smell and I love the great results of actually creating brighter skin on my face! My pregnancies have created dark spot on my face and this is helping even those out. I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review!
Garnier skin active clearly brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer does just that and so much more. Moisturizes and makes your skin glow beautifully. I would use it every day forever if I could afford to buy it like that. I recommended and shared samples with friends and family and coworkers.
I enjoyed using the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It moisturizes nicely. It simplifies my routine so I don't have to use a separate sunscreen. I like that it has vitamin c in it but I can't tell if my skin is brighter.
"I don't like the sunscreen smell, but other than that I find this to be a god product. It does not feel thick on my skin and I felt that my skin was re-hydrated. Note: I receive this product free for testing and reviewing purposes, but the opinions are my own."
"I love this so much! It made my skin more radiant, and I have more even skin tone because of this. I would recommend this to anyone. All skin tones would work with this lotion. It makes your skin feel smooth all day, and it's not grease or anything. It is the best lotion I have used in ages. I feel so good when I use this."
I love the smell and lightness of this product. It doesn't leave my skin feeling gross and greasy. The best part is that is protects my skin at the same time. I am very light skinned and burn very easily. I've notice my skin evening out after two days of using it.
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer made my skin glow and feel soft after just a few days use. In the tube it smells like SPF but it actually has a soft, clean floral scent that I love. I love my new glowing skin. It absorbs super fast into my skin so I can slather it on and put makeup over top within 1 minute. Perfect for the busy mom!"
"I really love the way it got absorbed so quick and the result it gives to me, but there was only one downside when I tried this product out which is it's scent. The scent was not bad, it did't make me have bad impression on it but not a good one because it is not a smell that can make me keep in mind. But generally speaking, it is a good product though."
"I was given this by Self magazine to test out!! What a great moisturizer! It felt light & fresh on my skin, not too heavy. The scent was nice! It worked great under my makeup! I would definitely buy it & recommend it :) My skin seemed smoother & brighter after a week!"
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightning and Smoothjng Daily Moisturizer is amazing! After just one week of using this product during the morning my face is visibly brighter and has a radiant glow to it! I've been getting a lot of compliments on how healthy and well my skin looks.
"I love this moisturizer. In one week I have noticed a big difference in my skin. It is moisturized well, glowing, and so soft. I also love the scent. Friends that I have shared the samples with have called me to rave about how much they love it. We will never use anything else."
I couldn't believe how well this product works! I have very bad dry skin on my forehead to where it flakes. With just ONE use of Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 I was able to to apply my make-up and feel great about the way it looked!
"it did a great job at making my skin brighter, with a great glow, it did smooth dry, rough skin. the one neg thing was, the scent was stronger then i like for a face product. i also used it on my hands, it did a wonderful job smoothing out my dry hands."
"i love the smell and the fact it doesn't make my face feel oily and sticky, i don't have to keep applying it a lot i also sun burn every easy because i have fair skin, so i didn't get a sun burn while wearing it which is great. i also have sensitive skin and i totally forgot that i was wearing it except for the very nice smell"
I love garnier new moisturizer. It doesn't have a scent. I get migraines easily and any little scent will put me under for days. This moisturizer doesn't do that to my face. It doesn't clog my pours leaving my face feel heavy. I hate putting sunscreen on my face so this moisturizer works perfect for me becuase it already has spf included in it. I am a huge fan.
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a life changer! Since I was a teenager, I've used foundation to cover my skin, every day. Since I've started using this moisturizer, my skin has improved so much! Some days I even go without foundation! :)"
"I highly recommended Garnier Brightening & Smooth daily moisturizer.I feel this product has so many great qualities that if you don't give yourself the one week challenge you are missing out. It is easy to apply, smells great and is not greasy. Your face feels the difference immediately and it shows the results in one week..The fact that it has an SPF 15 included means it is one less thing for you do to or worry about. I love the smell, feeling and results of a brighter, smoother face."
Garnier Clearly Brighter skin creme is a great product! It is a sunscreen as well as a moisturizer. It is perfect for your face with a level of spf 15! After using this product I have noticed my face is definitely brighter and a lot softer! I love that it uses the power of vitamin c and LHA. I also love the face that it is oil free! I recommend applying after you have washed and dried your face and before heading outside for the day. Overall completely satisfied and would recommend to anyone who wants clearly brighter beautiful skin!
"I am in love with this new moisturizer! It goes on and does not feel heavy, It has not made my face break out so far which is great as I am sensitive to certain things. After only a few days my face already looks like it is glowing. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a wonderful facial moisturizer for sure!!"
Garnier Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer works great! It helps my skin look moisturized and smooth while providing the UV protection I need daily. It helped brightening up my dull winter looking skin. I will continue to use this as the weather warms up!
"I am loving this. Even if you dont have uneven skin tone, this really can change the redness if you have any. It stopped a lot of irritation. I had itchy skin and that went away!. I loved my samples and I loved the outcome. I still have a lot more left and I will continue to use. After I run out, I am running to go purchase. This is a must have."
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer provided a lot more to my skincare routine than I thought it would! I thought it would just be a thin moisturizer, but not only does it have SPF sun protection, it transformed the texture of my skin! It's definitely smoother and more glowy! It doesn't make my skim oily or feel to thin and greasy! It's the perfect consistency!"

With in a couple days it made a huge noticeable difference and improvement. I like that the moisturizer doesn't make my face break out and it's very light, so I can't feel it on my skin."
"My skin was so dried out, red and just gross looking up until I tried this product. Now my skin is so much softer and so radiant! I put it on every 4 hours and once right before bed. It's a perfect formula for outside wear! It was nongreasy and had a pleasant scent. It didn't cause irritation to my skin at all."
I love it! Garnier knows exactly what needs to be done to have healthy skin. I love how my skin is so silky smooth. I love how healthy and Glowy it looks. I love the fact that it comes with SPF in it. It helps protect my skin from any further damage. I think they hit home with this!

I have shared with ten friends and they all live it and have made the switch to Garnier! We all have greater looking and feeling skin!
"I really liked how this product glided smoothly onto my skin and absorbed quickly. It did not leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky. I also really like the light fresh scent. Not too overpowering or overwhelming. Over all I liked this product, I just wished it had a higher spf."
The sent is amazing. Almost like spring time. i love how it protects my skin when I am in the sun. And it really does as described. It brightens my skin even on gloomy days. It smooths my skin even when my face tends to peel. And it moisturizes my skin with out oil I might add. I for one will be telling all my friends about this brand
I love that over the course of a week my skin has gotten so much smoother and brighter. I can only imagine how great my skin is going to look as I continue to use it. I also love the fact that it has SPF 15 in it so its protecting my face as I step outside also.
"This is such an innovative product from Garnier's Skin Active line. The formula is gentle enough to be used daily, and promotes routine skin regiments. The containers I received are in a compact, practical size easy for travellers or people like myself who are always on the go!"
My skin looks so much better and feels healthier within 1 week of using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15! I also noticed that my skin is brighter and smoother and it's evened out my skin tone. This is my new favorite product!
I'm rating 5 starts because I have very sensitive skin and I had no reaction to it ( no burning ) it has a very pleasant smell and that's always a plus in my book! It's truly is oil-free. An it's great for my daughter to use as well because of the sunscreen in it she won't get burned plus she will have soft skin.
"I loved the way the moisturizer felt on my skin, it was supple, easy to apply, and kept my skin hydrated the whole day. Like I said before though, I did not like how it only had 15 spf because I prefer it being a little higher but it did a great job at preventing new dark spots and lightening my old spots so maybe in a few months, it well even out my skin tone. Give it a shot but remember to add more spf f you will be out in the sun all day."
"I just simply love this moisturizer. I saw a huge difference just after few times using it. my skin was softer, smoother. my skin tone was even and I love the Spf 15 protection which is perfect for mild spring sun. I would recommend it to all my friends and family"
I loved this stuff! It felt so soft and light on my skin. After a week I saw huge improvements in my skin. I had a bright glow to my face that made me look younger and instantly took years off my face. I love that while moisturizing I am getting protection from the suns uv rays.. no skin cancer for this gal!
"I just tried a sample of it and I love the scent, the texture and how smooth it makes my skin feel! Based on this I'm going to buy a full size and see how it does for brightening and evening out my skin tone and smoothing fine lines. Will rate it again after a few weeks of use."
"I love Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. Not only does it protects my skin against sun, it also hydrates my skin too! Even though I received this product for free, my opinions are 100% true and original of my own!"
"I love my new Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 overall, but my favorite thing is the way it makes my skin feel! I love how refreshed and smooth my skin feels and looks after applying. I also like how it smells and evens out my skin tone making my face look more awake and bright. I would definitely recommend and buy again!"
me the most about Garnier Clearly Brighter Smoothing Daily Moistirizer SPF15 was the enticing scent. It's lightweight and feels like nothing is on my skin. I have never experienced such a wonderful Moistirizer and I recommend it to all my friends. #ActiveIsBetter #GarnierCrowd #sponsored I am a member of Crowdtap and received free samples to share with my friends for trial purposes. The opinions above are my own opinions based on my own experience with this product.
I have a few light brown spots on my cheeks from sun I have tried everything $-$$$$ including laser but it didn't really do anything . I've tried this 3 weeks ago and I was shocked I can barely see them and after applying this I wait 3 min and then add 1 pump with my cc cream and you can't see anything !!! Really amazing get it !!
I received this product as part of the review club. The moisturizer leaves your skin feeling instantly softer after 1 use. 1 small pump covers my entire face and it is lightweight and has a very pleasant smell. It's not oily and doesn't cause my combination skin to get greasy. As a shift worker I noticed a brighter glow to my skin and I didn't look quite as tired. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
The scent is subtle. It has that unique garnier smell but lighter in my opinion. When it dried it didn't feel greasy although as it gets drier and drier it feels like I need to add more. Maybe not used to it. Skin didn't look any brighter. But have only tried it once. Getting the coupon so I can try it for a lot longer period. Will post again after I've tested it.
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer instantly replenishes my skin once I put it on and it doesn't leave my face feeling greasy and heavy. I also love that it has SPF in it to help protect my skin from the sun's damaging rays. It's a great product to add to your daily skin care routine.
"Although I didn't expect a miracle, I would have liked at least a bit if a difference. This is definitely a nice effective moisturizer, and feels great, but no difference in lines and wrinkles. I don't think any moisturizer will get rid of lines, so with that in mind, I think this is a good moisturizer and good for the price. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
My absolute favorite thing is the scent. It's so sweet and great smelling. If I didn't know better I would taste it. It's great moisturizing formula and you wouldn't even know it's got SPF because it's lightweight and dries quickly. I absolutely love it. Wouldn't change it for the world. I am a member of Crowdtap and I received a free sample for testing purposes. Thea opinions are my own.
I received this product to try as part of the product review club. I didn't have a lot of time to really test this out and notice a substantial differnce but it was a nice moisturizer. It had s light floral type scent and was quite light weight. I liked how it felt on my skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Was generally happy with this product. I found I had to use fairly sparingly or else my skin had too much glow, as it would make me quite oily. That's not a problem as it means it will last longer. I haven't noticed a dramatic improvement in my skin texture, or fine lines. It was an overall adequate product if you are looking for a moisturizer with spf. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I used the product for 2 weeks and didn't notice much difference in my skin quality, smoothness or brightness. Maybe over a long period of time there would be more difference. The smell wasnt great but also wasn't horrible and I didn't find the product to be greasy. At thins point I wouldn't recommend this product over another due to its affectiveness. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is a nice facial moisturizer. It has a light, pleasant scent. It goes on smooth and leaves my skin moisturized but not feeling oily which I really like. I love that it has an SPF 15 included so I know I have light protection from the sun any time I am wearing it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
LOVE this moisturizer soo much. It smells AMAZING and it gives just enough moisture for my face with two pumps without making my skin feel oily or greasy. My skin even feels like it has cleared up the redness on my cheeks sincfe I gave been using it. LOVE this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I like this product, Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter. For someone looking for a light moisturizer this is perfect. Leaves the skin feeling soft & smooth. The smell is nice. And I like that it is in a pump. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was lucky enough to be able to try the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer courtesy of Chick Advisors' #TryGarnier campaign. I like that it is a super light formula and blends quickly into the skin. It is all that is claims to be. I find my skin is brighter and well hydrated without feeling greasy. The best part is that it contains SPF so great for people like me who don't always remember to wear sunscreen. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This is really light feeling,but very effective.At this time of year,I really struggle with facial dryness.It sinks into the skin quickly,and leaves a fresh,clean feel that is not heavy.Will purchase this again,for sure! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Nice moisturizer. I like the citrus smell too. I didn't notice a noticeable brightening and smoothing effect though. I was sent this product free to review from Chickadvisor's product review club. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I pulled the sample from a catalog and figured I'd give it a try. After the first use, I noticed a difference in how my skin looked and felt. My face felt smooth and not tight. I like this product because it is oil free, which is a concern of mine, because my skin gets oily fast. I noticed that my skin looked clearer after applying makeup. The cost is a bit more than I would usually pay, but if this continues to show improvement on my skin, then the price is worth it."
"I received a free sample of this product from ChickAdvisor. I was pleasantly surprised with this moisturizer. I'm typically fairly picky because I need something light enough that won't make my face oily by the middle of the day, and this product worked for me! It was soothing and felt light upon application. I noticed a difference in my skin a few days after use and thought it looked brighter. I would definitely buy this product again and would recommend it to others. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I got this product for free to review. I like the texture of the moisturizer. It's light yet hydrating enough for my combination skin. Definitely a great product that I would like to recommend to all my friends. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I really liked the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer. My face felt so soft and smooth after using it. I love how it has SPF to help protect my face. It comes with a easy to use pump dispenser. It doesn't feel thick and greasy on my skin. I use this everyday now. I highly recommend. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
This is a great everyday moisturizer! I appreciate the fact that is contains SPF to protect my face. In addition it comes in a cute bottle with a convenient dispenser pump. It smells good enough. The consistency is medium - not too thick or too thin. My skin loves it and absorbs this moisturizer easily. I would definitely consider buying this again as my staple daily moisturizer. Disclosure: I received this product free for review purposes. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Have been using the brightening and smoothing cream for while now. I even went out and bought another one. Yes I liked it that much. Love the way my skin feels afterwards. Haven't noticed any drastic change but my face feels a lot smoother and less tight. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer for free as part of ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I love this product, it smells great and a little dab goes a long way. The uneven skin tone on my forehead has become less noticeable thanks to using this product on a daily basis. Hours after applying it my face still feels soft and smooth. I would defiantly keep using it in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received Garnier Skinactive Clearly Brighter moisturizer to review from Chickadvisor. I loved this product because it is light, oil free and includes spf 15. I have noticed my skin is evening out and looks more clear. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This had literally changed my life. I love it so much. I did receive it to try out from chickadvisor. The scent of the moisturizer is actually nice. I use it every morning and night. It has smooth out my face since in the winter my face can get very dry. I do notice that my face is brighter. I definitely recommend this product. I love everything about it (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Garnier Skinactive Clearly Brighter moisturizer is my new favourite product. It is light and oil free. I love that it includes spf 15. I have been using it for a few weeks and notice that my skin is getting more even and clear. I'm definitely a new fan of Garnier Skincare thanks to Chickadvisor. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
This moisturize does exactly what it says it will do. My skin felt amazing week moistened and refreshed. My face looked physically brighter and healthier within the first week. It also roof my face of dry spots. This is one of my favorites! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I loved the scent of this moisturizer & the lightness to it. It felt non greasy on my skin. My skin did loo more radiant a week after staring its use. I didn't like how much product came out in 1 pump- a little too much at once. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using this Smoothing Moisturizer for about 2 weeks now and I really love it! My skin is quite dry, especially in the winter months, and this moisturizer really works for my skin. It makes my skin feel soft, silky and moisturized. The best part for me is that it contains SPF and helps protect me from the sun, as the sun irritates my skin. I received this product from Chickadvisor Product Club. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer from ChickAdvisor to review. I found this to be an excellent daytime moisturizer. It goes on nicely and is not oily, so it wears very well under makeup and bb creams. I like that it has spf but is still lightweight and does not cause breakouts. I did not notice any ""brightening"" effects, but this moisturizer is still a lovely and makes my skin feel supple and happy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This moisturizer is amazing, with SPF 15 it is a nice base under my makeup or on days where I don't wear makeup this is a great base! It is lightweight, absorbs quickly, and provides just enough moisture to my combination skin. I definitely will repurchase in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Very impressed with this product! I have tried many, many different skin cares products since I was a teenager. I stick with a few tried and true products that really work for me and I think this will become one of them! After only a few days of use I could actually see more brightness in my skin and a more even tone. Love the sun protection factor as well, as I am very fair skinned. Love it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really like the silkiness of the moisturizer! It takes very little to do the job, did not have any overpowering scents and was not at all irritating. It left my face feeling supple and seemed to improve the appearance of fine lines as well. I did not find it made my skin look any brighter but I am hopeful with continued use I will see those results. I will be buying my own bottle and have my oldest daughter using it as well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have found favourable results with this cream. It seems to work better than some more expensive brands I have tried. The spots on my face look like they are starting to fade. My skin looks brighter. The only downfall I have found is that I had some pimples break out, but that could have been the chocolate. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really like this moisturizer. The smell is very pleasant, a little goes a long way, and it spreads and blends in easily. After the first week, I felt comfortable enough to run errands on the weekend without putting on foundation. My skin looked fresh and well hydrated (and I hadn't been keeping up with my water quota). Dark spots and texture differences were less noticeable. I will use this product again for sure (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was impressed with the softness and moisturizing ability of the cream, and the spf addition was a really nice insurance policy for my face. I am prone to having sensitive skin and getting little reactions here and there when trying a new product, unfortunately I did get a bit of a break out, and had to stop using it... I am planning on trying again soon as I loved the product it self and wanted to make sure that the reaction wasn't from something other then the cream etc. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"in just a lil over a week i am noticing even skin tone,my fine line and wrinkles are softened.my skin looks more refined and much smoother.. this moisturizer absorbs fast and evenly ...with no greasy feeling... my skin looks brighter even the dark circles under my eyes are fading away...love this!!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
#GotItFree from #ChickAdvisor and #Garnier I love the smell of the moisturizer its not greasy and a little goes a long way. My skin is more even in tone and I love the fact that there is a sun protection factor of 15. Great price and definitely would recommend this product. Results are brighter looking skin (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This moisturizer felt amazing on my face. It was not heavy at all. It was light and smooth and felt kind of silly to the touch. I like that it was not heavily scented, just a hint of scent. Despite the fact it is winter the skin never felt dry so I did not feel the need to reapply during the day. I would most definitely continue using this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I tested this product for Chick Advisors. I was surprised at how well it moisturized for being such a light cream. My skin was soft and smooth with no greasy, oily or heavy feel to it. I found it to be comparable to other more expensive moisturizers which I have used, but my complexion had a more even and brighter appearance. I will definitely buy this product again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I really love this product. The scent is great and I felt a difference after just one use. My skin felt softer. I haven't had enough time to see if it faded spots but it definitely seemed to have a softening effect. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this moisturizer from chick advisor. I used this for about 10 days, didn't notice any changes whatsoever. It moisturizes well and that's about it. I don't think I'll be buying this or continue using it. For the price, I'd rather spend a little more for sonethibf that actually works. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer has a bit of an odd smell which reminds me of cigarette smoke. It is oil-free, lightweight, and absorbs quickly into the skin. The SPF 15 is a bit light in my opinion, but I do like the fact that the lotion does brighten the skin with use due to the inclusion of Vitamin C. It also has an antioxidant complex that promotes healthy skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have always enjoyed the Garnier face care range. After using this moisturizer, I found it did seem to make my skin look a little smoother and more uniform but it didn't brighten up my complexion. I did like that there weren't really any shiny parts on my face from my oily skin. I did like the convenient pump bottle though as I didn't have to try and close a little with lotion on my hand. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I got this product free to test from ChickAdvisor. I didn't particularly like this moisturizer. I have an oily complexion so I found that the lotion made my face very greasy. My skin did appear smoother but this definitely wasn't the right product for my skin. I would still recommend it to others. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was happy to receive this product from Chick Advisor to review. I liked this moisturizer right from the first time I pumped some onto my finger. The texture is light, non greasy and has a fresh, vibrant scent. I tend to break out from certain moisturizers, so I was prepared for the worst. I am happy to say that my skin has reacted positively to this cream and I use it every day. My skin is left soft and smooth with every use. I will purchase this cream in the future! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really like the consistency of this product. I apply to a clean face and it feels moisturizing, not greasy or thick or too thin, it is just like Goldielocks wanted ;) I have sun spots and although this brightener made no difference on them, I do feel it evens the tone of the rest of my face. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"While this moisturizer goes on feeling so refreshing, clean and light, I found my face still felt dry and unde rmositurized. I ended up having to put more of my usual brand on to take away that dry face feel. I wouldn't say it made my complexion clearer or brighter so I am kind of disappointed. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is an awesome daytime moisturizer! I've always had a hard time finding an SPF that's moisturizing enough for my dry-ish skin but won't leave me feeling greasy once I've applied makeup! I also love that this has brightening properties since I've recently starting seeing some dark spots arising from my teen years of tanning! It smells soft and light and sinks into skin pretty fast. If you're looking for an SPF at a great price, I'd definitely suggest this! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I'd recommend this product for someone who's got skin on the dry side. My skin isn't and therefore I felt it was too thick. It's only been a couple of weeks of using this product, but I haven't noticed any brightening effects. I will continue to use it throughout the rest of the winter/spring cooler/drier temps. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received this product as part of the Chick Advisor Review Club. I love the soft feel of this moisturizer. It has a very pleasant light scent. I have been using it for a couple of weeks now and have noticed such a difference in my skin texture and colour. My skin is smoother and looks more even and brighter. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I look tired most days (full time working single mom of 4) but i have been using this cream, and feel my skin looks brighter and firmer. Less tired looking, more radiant. Love the spf factor. very impressed with this cream. Thank you so much! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was in need of a new face cream so I was very excited when I received this free to try and review. It goes on so nice, it's not greasy and absorbs fast. My face feels soft and smooth. I instantly saw a difference in the brightness of my skin. My friend even asked me what was different about me. I would highly recommend this product and will definitely be buying it in the future! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received this product free of charge from Chick Advisor to review. I have tried many different moisturizer The product as a very pleasant smell and felt very light when applied on my face. I hate when it leaves a film or is too thick. This product definitely wasn't. It did leave my skin smooth which I love Not sure about the brightening effect. Overall is a great product..Is it worthy of switching my regular skincare with? I am not sure. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Got this for free as part of the Review Club. It gave me a good first impression - glided on smoothly on my skin and smelled nice. after too weeks, i did notice my skin is smoothly; however, i haven't noticed any brightening. also would be interested in seeing how effective the SPF is in the next couple months. It's still rainy season in my part of the country! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Got this product to try for free and I quite like it! It is light weight and goes on smooth. I really liked that it was oil free and didn't cause any break outs. I didn't notice any brightness but I have only been using it for a week so far, hopefully, it gets better. Overall i would try it for longer and maybe but it again. It was a little pricey though. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I got this product to try and I will say I quite like it. It is easy on the skin, absorb quite fast and non sticky nor smelly. I've only tried it for one week so I didn't really notice a huge difference in regards to the brightness of my skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Thanks Chickadvisor for the opportunity to try this product for free! I really like this moisturizer! I love the lockable pump so it doesn't spill in my makeup bag. I love that it doesn't make me breakout, and I love that it helped clear up the redness in my face. My pores seemed smaller, and my face just seemed clearer. I definitely recommend this moisturizer! #TryGarnier (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
For a drugstore moisturizer it is a really good price. It didn't break me out was light weight and also has a nice scent. I didn't notice an incredible difference to the skin but I did appreciate the product (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"It was light to wear and having the spf in the winter is a requirement which is delightful. I was using the product while on vacation and for days out about it was a stand along and didn't burn. It also helped keep my complexion looking great. My only negative is really a preference thing, not a performance one...the fragrant is very strong. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like the fact that Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer has a pump as I do not like those ones where you have to stick your finger inside to get some cream. I have a sensitive skin and nose and I find this product is friendly on my skin and it does not sting, plus it has a pleasing smell. Overall, I am happy with this product and definitely will buy & recommend it to friends. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received a sample of this moisturizer to test. It's a nice light moisturizer. Absorbs quickly, leaves skin feeling very soft and smooth. Would be a good option for summer as it is not greasy and includes sunblock. Effectiveness in winter is only average as it is quite light and as a result I found myself re-applying partway through the day as it was very dry and cold when I was testing it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
On A good day my skin takes a while before I see a Difference but with this product I noticed and felt it quickly In one week My skin is so radiant soft and glowing. I love the consistency and it easily absorbs into the skin Even with the winter my skin is well moisturized and feels less flaky. Garnier has been doing a very good Job with skin care and I am so excited I got to try this product (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I got this product free through the Product Review Club. I like that the moisturizer comes with SPF which helps our face get protection from the sun, no need to add extra layer to the face. It works well with makeup too. This does not feel that you are wearing any moisturizer, which is a plus for me. It is a good moisturizer if you are under the sun a lot. The only thing is I did not feel this moisturizer is brightening. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Provides excellent moisture that lasts a day. My skin looks and feels hydrated and luminous. I am very happy to have been chosen to review this amazing moisturizer. Thank you chickadvisor and Garnier. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Like most garnier moisturizers I've tried, it goes on smooth and blends well with my makeup, and I haven't had any adverse reactions as I normally do when I suddenly switch moisturizers. I just don't use spf though, as I find I need the sun to control breakouts. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have had this for a few weeks and I have found it to work quick. Even in dry weather( winter ) it's not heavy on your skin. I got this for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I'm glad I used it, now I will throw out my old stuff and use this. Thanks Garnier. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Thanks to Garnier, I received the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Moisturizer as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. It is easy to apply from the pump bottle. The moisturizer is light and smooth, so it does not clog up my pores. I do not get any blemishes. Since I have sensitive skin, my face always break out whenever I try something new. This time, there is no bad reaction to it. My face is brighter and smoother. I am happy with the results. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"A week after first using it, a co-worker commented on how nice my skin looked. Not greasy or oily. The only thing I do not like is that it made my psoriasis act up so I had use an additional face cream for that. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was fortunate enough to try this product for free through the Chickadvisor product review club. I'm actually quite impressed with this moisturizer. It's light and non greasy, which is perfect for my incredibly oily skin. It absorbs extremely quickly and actually helps with my oil control throughout the day. My makeup applies beautifully after using it. I also have mild rosacea, and it's gotten considerably better since using this moisturizer. I would absolutely purchase this! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The texture of this lotion is nice. It soaked in well and didn't leave my skin too tacky. I had no problems putting on makeup over top of it. The thing that kills me about this moisturizer is the scent. It smells of fake chemically citrus. It makes me want to gag when I put it on and it does have a tendency to linger. I also don't like that it's only SPF 15. It's so low that I will use a different sunscreen. So, I would almost rather it have no SPF. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"this is a great moisturizer. My skin has not been dry once while using this during the winter months. I use it daily in the morning and in the night after washing my face. I find my skin is a bit oilier by mid afternoon but nothing a tissue or blotting paper won`t fix. There is no strong scent and unlike other moisturizers I have tried in the past, this one did not make me break out. Great product and it`s value for your money spent. A little goes a long way. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
After a few weeks of using the moisturizer I've noticed that my skin was brighter and much softer. I love the fact that the cream is not greasy or oily and it smells great. Worked amazing under my daily makeup; worked even better with formal makeup (including primer) Definitely did what it was suppose to do (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Garner SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & smoothing Moisturizer goes on smooth and is not greasy. I noticed a brighter complexion after 1 week of using this product. I also noticed my skin was clearer and softer. This product has replaced my current moisturizer because the performance with outstanding. Great quality and excellent price. I highly recommend this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I suffer from severely un-even skin tone, large pores and acne scarring, this has done wonders for my skin! After about a week, I noticed a dramatic difference to the look and feel of my skin! I love this and highly recommend this! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I was a bit of a skeptic when I applied for this review. I have combination skin and will often get a minor breakout when I try new products and don't often do well using moisturizer but I have to say that this one is really lovely. My skin is smooth and I do notice that my pores seem to be refining a bit. Very happy that I was able to review this product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have tried a few different moisturizers since I turned 40, and have not found one that seems to work as well as this one. I usually find 1 kind that helps with my fine lines, and another that helps with the dry skin etc....but this one actually takes care of it all! My skin has not felt this good in years. it is soft and my skin tone is more even, and no more dry, flaky skin (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Another great product from Garnier . SkinActive goes on smooth, never greasy and protects your face from the sun . It visibly brightens the skin and is a good moisturizer for everyday wear. I recommend this product! Thank you Chick Advisor for letting me try this for free :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I absolutely love this moisturizer!! I love the packaging that it came in & the bottle really ""pops"" when I opened the package!! I use it in the morning after I wash my face, it makes my skin so soft & smooth & it's not greasy like other moisturizers so I use it again before I go to sleep!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have really enjoyed using this moisturiser. Took away the winter blahness of my skin. My skin does not feel greasy and my skin has not had any negative reactions. I would definitely buy this product again and recommend it to all my friends. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This lotion was pretty good. I did not notice my skin any brighter, but to me it was a basic moisturizer with sunscreen. The texture was smooth and not sticky at all. Works well under makeup. The scent is also quite fresh and not overpowering. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Loved this product. I'm notorious for NOT using anything on my face. (and I'm a make-up artist!!) This was such a nice product. Its creamy and smooth and very effective. I used it in combination with the micellar water (WOW) and my skin has never looked better!! Fully endorse this product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product as part of the Product Review Club. PROS: Light in texture and scent No adverse reaction in terms of sensitivity or breakouts, SPF 15 CONS: No change in appearance - if you have a little bit of dullness on your face this may work for you, but I have some hyperpigmentation and have not seen a difference in the past 2 weeks for me. Prefer a product with a higher SPF due to my sun sensitivity. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I liked this product as it is not heavy or greasy. It absorbed really well and did not just sit on the skin. I have noticed an overall evenness of my skin tone since I started using it so it certainly lives up to what it says it will do. Although it does what it says as my skin is somewhat older, I think I may benefit from a product more geared towards older skin. I received this product for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Thanks Chick Advisor once again! I love the juicy smells of this moisturizer! It almost makes you forget it's winter - speaking of winter.. Dry skin.. This was such a great fix! It's also light enough to wear under make up, which is always a bonus! I will purchase when I'm out, and recommend! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Absolutely love this moisturizer! I have been using it regularly in the mornings and at night now for two weeks. I have noticed a visible difference in my skin - it is brigher and feels softer, no more dry patchy skin. I highly recommend it and will be purchasing this from now on. Great for combination skin, no breakouts and no funny or chemical smell to it. Leaves my skin feeling fresh and brighter. I look less tired. #gotitfree (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Thank you for the opportunity to try this product. I absolutely loved it and would purchase in the future. I loved the way it left my face feeling after first use, and started noticing better skin after the 4th day and only got better. I would recommend it to my friends. I especially liked how it applies. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this free to test from Product Review and I have to admit, I wasn't sure that it could offer what was stated. I have also have to admit that I am impressed. I use it in the morning before I put on my makeup and it goes on smoothly, with no greasy residue, subtle smell and works well with make up application. I can see a bit of a difference in my skin tone but it has only been a few weeks so it may just get better from here. I would recommend for sure. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like the smell and feel of this moisturizer. Its lightweight and doesn't feel at all greasy. However i find its not quite as long lasting as my normal moisturizer. So my advice is if you have ""Normal"" skin then this would be an amazing product for you. My skin is to dry on my cheek area so i need something a little heavier normally. But over all an excellent product my 14 year old daughter LOVES it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was given the opportunity to review this product and it has been good so far. I applied it in the morning after a face wash and I do feel that my skin is softer. My skin tone is a bit brighter but I haven't gotten to that ""wow, I""m impressed"" factor yet. Maybe I just need to give it more time as it has only been two weeks. Overall, a good product. i would recommend it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received this free through Chick Advisor to test and I have to say after a week of using it I love it :) I will purchase this for sure in the near future and I would recommend it to family and friends. I love the way my skin feels (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product as part of the Chick Advisor Product Review Club. While my skin is smoother and well-moisturized, I'm not sure if it's much ""brighter"". I do appreciate that the formulation has 15spf. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I like the feel of this moisturizer. It doesn't feel heavy or greasy. It does make skin look brighter. It no dramatically brighter but it's noticeable. It's better than many many others that I have tried . I feel like this is something I can finally stick to (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product as part of the Chick Advisor Product Review Club, and while I like the way the moisturizer feels, I had to use double the amount that I use of my regular department store moisturizer to get the same ""moisture"". Although it left my skin soft, it's not worth it for me. ps - loved the extra surprise in the sample box! Delicious orange tea from David's tea and a cute mug.

"I received this product as part of the product review club and have been using it for 2 weeks. I do notice a difference in my skin's texture, it is smoother. I don't know if it has actually made my skin brighter though. I do appreciate the SPF protection. I would use this product again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Love this moisturizer. It has a great smell and you need very little so it would last a long time. It's light weight and absorbs quickly. I would definitely buy this again. I noticed an improvement in my skin after using twice a day for 2 weeks. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received the Garnier's SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I have been using it for 2 weeks now. My face looks a little more refreshed. It has a very light scent, very easy to apply and it absorbs very quickly. What I liked about this product is that it did not make my t-zone oily. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
i received this product for free to review. for a moisturizer with spf it was not strong around the eye area which always makes me cry. so that was great. also though i did not think that the time of year to release this product as you are to put it on before sun exposure. calgary has been warm but i'm not spending a lot of time outside in february. garnier makes affordable products (still) please keep that up.

@chickadvisor@garnier i receve this product to try and give my honnest opinion. So i have to tell that i really enjoy this moisturizer. My skin looks brighter after only a couple of days. I also love the fact that they have put a spf 15 in ! I recommand as a daily moisturizer ! #skinactive #garnier #lovemoisturizer (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was fortunate to receive this product through Chickadvisor to test out and I have seen some improvement in my skin. I sometimes get breakouts and have the occasional scarring. I have used it for 3 weeks now and my spots seem to be getting lighter which make me happy. I will continue to use it to see how my skin looks and feels after a month, so far so good! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Love love love this moisturizer! It is perfect for my skin! I usually have shiny/ oily skin and am constantly wiping my face with tissues to get rid of some shine. This is not necessary anymore with Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer. My skin feels moist and smooth but not oily at all. I love the fact that it has SPF sunscreen. Garnier definitely found a new costumer in me! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this face lotion from the awesome people at ChickAdvisor, I am a fan of how it makes my skin luminous, but when it gets even remotely near the eye my eyes are watering for hours, I find the scent to be too strong. But I love that it has SPF 15 in it that's really important to me,for my skincare routine. If they made an unscented version I would buy it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Overall, I liked the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer. I thought that the moisturizer itself felt soft,lightweight and not greasy (even with the SPF). I like how the cream absorbs fast. I also like how the SPF is already in the moisturizer, so I don't have to worry about the sun. The Garnier cream did actually make my skin softer. I don't know if I would say my skin is '""brighter"" but skin tone is more even. The only downside was the strong smell. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This is a nice light moisturizer. Skin felt nicely moisturized without leaving any oily residue. My skin did seem to be smoother. I have only used this product for a couple weeks and I have not noticed if this will brighten the skin or not. #GotItFree #ChickAdvisor (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received this for free to review. I've been using it for 2 weeks and really like it. It moisturized my face without being oily. There was no greasy feeling when I put it on and dried quickly. I didn't find it brightened my skin but I didn't expect it to. It did give my skin a nice smooth hydrated look and feel. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this to review from CA - thank you! This has a pleasant scent, and a greasy feel, left my face a little bit shiny after. It's good for winter months when the air is dry, but I would use a more lightweight moisturizer in the humid summer. Recommended for those who like a scent. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product didn't come in my package, HOWEVER, I had to try the line after using the other two products in this line. In comparison to the Miracle Wake-Up Cream I thought it was great! I love products where a little goes along way and this was the case with this. My skin felt great during the day and as a bonus I was able to wear it underneath my make-up and it didn't feel like too much! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
After using Garnier Skin Active clearly brighter for the last 2 weeks I can honestly say the moisturizer is great. I didn't really notice any brightening to my skin but I have very fair skin. Even with my combination skin it worked great. I will definitely continue using this. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"After using Ganier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer for almost 2 weeks my skin did feel smoother, but I didn't find it looked brighter. It is very light, absorbed into my skin fast and was not oily or greasy at all. I will continue to use this product!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was excited to be picked to try this out ! I have been using it for about 2 1/2 weeks now and I have actually noticed a difference. My face has a more even tone to it. The red and dark areas seem less,giving a more even tone . My face feels smoother and softer.I liked the soft scent which isn't overpowering,especially with all the scent free areas we have now. I will definatley be purchasing this in the future (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
So I have sensitive skin. It is hard to find a moisturizer that is perfect for my skin!! Well I have found it!! It makes my skin feel amazing and I do not have to worry about sun damage at all!! I personally recommend this to everyone and anyone!! Lets be honest who wouldn't love this!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Great product to test. Feels great on and is absorbed quickly. Smooth creamy texture. Not greasy or oily. I have mature skin so, it is really difficult to tell if it is making my skin brighter and smoother. Is a good moisturizer though and I love that it has spf 15 in it. Dispenser is very good and you get only as much as you need. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"The entire skin line of Garnier has been perfect for my aging skin. I have paid much more products that did not work. I am enjoying my skin, my freckles, and fresh face daily with the help of Clearly Brighter and I don't even mind being 51 with freckles. Yeah to all the Ginger's with freckles and sensitive skin this will make you feel awesome both with confidence and with your skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I really liked this product it gave my face a nice glow. I used it under my makeup and feel it made me look younger. It went on smooth and there is a pleasant smell. I did break out using this product but cannot say it is from this product and will try it again in another week. Great product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was given this to try for Chick Advisor and it is a wonderful moisturizer. It's nice and light and absorbs quickly into your skin without leaving a greasy residue. Has a lovely citrus scent to it that is very refreshing. However, I haven't seen any results as far as brightening my skin. Perhaps you have to use it longer to see any noticeable change ( I've only been using it for a couple of weeks). (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"It's a decent moisturizer, it is lightweight and has SPF. I don't know if this is the first thing I would grab if I wanted brighter skin though. I use lots of brightening skincare, but this wasn't as effective or as immediate compared to Asian products. It's hard to say if skincare is working since you do need to use it over a prolong period of time to see if it's working. I will continue to use to the product to see if it does brighten your complexion over time. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I liked this product. Makeup can be applied over the product with no problems. I like the size of the bottle as well. I liked the pump versus just a container that you have to put your fingers into. My face had a few dry patches, which this cream seemed to help with. Not sure about how effective SPF 15 is though? (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I loved the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer. It was amazing. It honestly brightened up my skin and made it feel much smoother. I noticed a difference after one week of using the items. The cleanser does a great job of removing make up and the micellar water is great as well for the light make up days. I'd recommend this to anyone looking to switch lines. You cant go wrong with this one. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
THIS CREAM SENT WAS GREAT AND i AM VERY SENSITIVE TO SMELLS. IT FELT SOOTHING IT BRIGHTENED THE SKIN BUT AT AGE 64 IT DID NOTING FOR MY AGING SKIN NO LIFTING PORES LOOKED LARGER . I WOULD USE THIS IN THE SUMMER WHEN I GET DARK AREAS FROM THE SUN BUT USE MY AGING CREAM AT NIGHT. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I like the moisturizing properties of the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer, but I do not recommend it because it fails as a brightening & smoothing moisturizer, as advertised. It is not overly scented and is a nice light moisturizer for day time use. However, I saw no results or improvement in the brightening/smoothing of my skin. I would not recommend this product to anyone. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using the same moisturizer for probably a decade so it's hard to sway me away from it. I liked this product, it smells good, it's not too thick, it definitely cures my dry skin. It's gonna be my #2 favourite, which is pretty good! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I had received a sample of the clearly brighter skin active and I was surprised at how much I actually love it. I have tried a few face moisturizers and this was my favorite. I love that when you put it on its light and doesn't make you feel greasy like a lot of face moisturizers. It also doesn't make you look shine thru out the day. Also the smell of it was really nice. My face also looks a lot smoother then it has and I wanted to say thank you for making a product that actually works.
"I got the opportunity to try this product for free. I have used it for about 2 weeks now and I have noticed some dark spots lightening up. Its not a heavy moisturizer and soaks into the skin almost instantly. It is perfect to apply makeup over or just wear on its own. I have oily to dry skin, and it was perfect for those dry spots on my face, and didn't make me feel too oily. Average retail price is a bit too high in my opinion, will look out for sales and buy it on sale. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer. Leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth but I really didn't notice my skin any brighter. I have used it for ten days so I will try it for a while longer and see what happens. Even without brightening I like how light it feels on my skin and how there is no greasy feeling. great under my makeup for protecting my skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this as part of the Product Review Club Offer: Garnier SkinActive I have to say i really am still waiting for the benefit of this moisturizer to surface. Added to the fact , the first time I applied it , I noticed a strong citrus like smell ....it was a bit too much , secondly it stung my eyes for some weird reason. I am not impressed at all for now. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this as a part of the Product Review Club offering to test. I had high hopes file this moisturizer, but didn't really see any results. I like the consistency of it and it goes on nicely. It is non-greasy and works well under my makeup. I also like that it has spf. Unfortunately, in addition to not seeing the benefits I expected, the scent is overwhelming. I do t have a sensitivity to fragrance, but this was overly floral and made it hard to use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been a regular user of Garnier's spot treatments before, and this may become the next favourite in my beauty routine. I love the fact that it has SPF in it, and in the short time I've been using it (through Chick Advisor) the general splotchiness and dull look of my skin looks better. I'm starting to get some age spots, so I'm really glad that great companies like Garnier are giving us such excellent options to treat our aging skin issues! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I got this product to test out through the ChickAdvisor product review club along with the Micellar Water and enjoyed using them both , my skin did feel softer and looked clearer , I liked that it had the added SPF 15 in it too so it's handy to use when I'm going to be outside (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I wanted to love this moisturizer but unfortunately I did not. After each use, it left my skin kind of oily and uneven. I am really disapointed. Maybe it is the sunscreen in it but my skin looked unhealthy (like I was eating French fries all the time). I had small pimples after using this moisturizer (and I usually add oil to my skin care routine and do not get pimples). (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received this product via Chick Advisor to try. I am unsure as to how i truly feel about this product at the moment. I find that it is causing some little red bumps on my lower cheek/jaw line BUT I am also 8 months pregnant so I can't for sure say that this is what is alone causes it. It moisturizes very well and it actually didn't make me greasy like a lot of facial moisturizers do. I intend of trying it again after pregnancy (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This moisturizer does the job! I tried this one right after using the Garnier Cleansing Water. Nice citrus smell and goes on nicely! You don't need to apply a lot and it is really moisturizing. I normally need to use a serum with my skincare routine in the winter, and I found I didn't even need one while using this moisturizer. A serum would probably have made my face too oily/shiny. It works well enough on it own, and made my face look brighter too! :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer, has a nice fresh scent to it. I like the consistency of the moisturizer, as it pumps out of the bottle.This has an SPF of 15 which is good, even though I prefer an SPF 30. I believe that the Vitamin c + lha antioxidant complex are making my skin appear more even and brighter with each use. This was a great buy! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I got the product from the review club. I only used it for 2 weeks, so I cannot say that my skin is definitely brighter. But it is an good moisturizer with good sunscreen. I do like that it contain sunscreen. so it has added protection. The city I live at has really really dry winter. and this moisturizer did have enough moisture for me as I have oily skin. I cannot say how it would do for dry skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received this product as part of the ChickAdvisor product review club. My thoughts are below: I really like how smooth it goes on my skin. There is no greasy residue or heavy build up left behind. My skin feels lush and looks healthy. I enjoy the product design as just a pump or two is the perfect amount for my face. I would definitely consider buying this product if it were on sale. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have only been using this for about 4 days and I already notice a difference in the tone of my skin as well as the texture! I can't wait to see how it is by the end of this bottle! This does not leave my skin feeling greasy or clog my pores. I have already recommended this product to friends and will be buying some for myself once this bottle is gone!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been trying to find a non-greasy solution to moisturize my combination skin daily. I have tried many brands. I wanted something I could put on under my makeup that would be light and oil-free, yet have SPF as well. I loved the sample I found, and now I am going to be a repeat customer. Thank you Garnier!"
"I received a sample of this product to try in the mail. It is a very effective moisturizer without any heavy or sticky feeling to it. It isn't greasy, and goes on very smooth. I do find the perfume of it a bit too strong, but that is only noticeable while applying, it's not something you smell throughout the day. I would recommend this cream. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love the Garnier Skin Active. The pump bottle make it easy to use. The lotion itself is very light and absorb very quick. It smells very good too. The SPF 15 is a plus. I found it is very important to have some sunscreen in our daily use. The price, 20.99, is a little bit too much for me. But apart of that, I think it is a very good product! I received this product for free as part of a Chick Advisor product review club. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this moisturizer for free with Chick Advisor. I have been using it for over a week now and I love it. It is light, non greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin. It has a nice citrus scent and is gentle on my skin. I love that it also has an SPF 15 protection as well. I have been using it after I cleanse with the Garnier Micellar cleansing water. My skin feels tighter and more refined. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Really enjoyed this! I. Was comparing it to my current favourite CeraVe moisturizer. This lotion is silkier and sinks in the skin right away. it felt great and it worked so well under my makeup. I do plan on purchasing after I run out. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product for free to review from Chick Advisor. I love how light this product is when you use it- not greasy at all with a nice scent to it. Added bonus is the SPF 15 (although I would like it even better if it has a higher SPF number!) But as a daily moisturizer with SPF this saves me one extra step of having to add a sunscreen under my moisturizer and make up. Price wise it is a bit on the pricer side, but it is reasonable. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
The smell is very nice with a fruity scent. Texture is not heavy yet provide enough moisture to the skin. It is easily absorbed by the skin and does not creature shininess. Overall is a very effective moisturizer for oily prone skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I really like the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer. It is really creamy and smooth. The cream goes on really nice and absorbs really quickly. After I applied the cream I found that my skin felt really smooth and soft and my face felt very refreshed. I have very dry skin and I love the this cream helps to moisturize my dry skin. I will buy this product again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I liked how this product made my skin feel. I like moisturizers and this one is one of the better ones in my opinion. It's super easy to apply too. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs a moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Haven't noticed any change in my skin tone but I do live this product. Put it on after I shower or wash my face. You only need a little product goes a long way. It rubs in in seconds and leaves my skin moisturized for hours. No greasy feeling rubs right in but can feel like amprotection barrier on my skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"After only a few uses, I thought my skin looked brighter and smoother. I like the easy application of this moisturizer and the bit of fresh fragrance. It is non greasy and effective. perfect for a mom on the go. I use it after the shower and found it was easy to apply make up over top. It is an effective and great product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This gem was included in my free product review box with the Micellar water by Garnier. It is a very nice moisturizer, that glides on easily with no greasiness. It has an spf of 15 which is a bonus. I have used itfor about 2 weeks and I can notice a positive difference in the clarity of my skin! I will definitely buy this product in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have been using this moisturizer since I received it 2 weeks ago. I love the light fragrance and non-greasy formula. I noticed that my skin tone looks more even and feels softer. I would recommend this moisturizer since others with SPF and these kinds of results are more expensive. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product for free from Chickadvisor as part of the Product Review club. This moisturizer did a great job of making my skin feel soft and smooth. It never leaves my skin greasy and I love that it has an SPF added. After a week of using it, I've received a few compliments on my skin which is the best sign that it's doing a good job for me! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really liked the smooth texture, scent (although I find it a bit strong) and the fact that it soaks into the skin and doesn't leave a greasy feel. The container it comes in is handy to dispense the perfect amount. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I tried Garnier skin active clearly brighter spf15 for the 7 days it recommends on the commercial. After the 7 days I did notice that my face was brighter. The product goes on smooth and isn't harsh on my skin. I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a reasonable priced product to make their skin look brighter (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received this great product from chickadvisor to try out and it felt great on my face and it wasn't sticky or tacky. I definitely can see the difference in my skin and it makes it feel so soft. It has a nice scent to it that is not over powering like some face products. I would definitely buy it and recommend it to my family and friends. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Great product that goes on smooth with a nice fresh scent. I love that I can use this as a daily moisturizer and it helps give me a glow. I think the frightening effect is only when you use the product though, it doesn't actually change the appearance of your skin long term. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I had the amazing opportunity to try this through chickadvisors product review club and I Love how clean and smooth my skin felt after applying this product to my face. It brightened the appearance of my skin and provided a great balance to my skin along with the effect amount of moisturizer. It didn't leave my face feeling oily or thick. I was quite impressed with the quality of this product . (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received this product as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I used the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer for one week. It feels nice on the skin when you put it on and have noticed small changes to my skin. It certainly made my skin look brighter after the first use. I would probably purchase this product again if it was on sale and I would recommend it to my friends. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Overall, I've been using Garner SkinActive Clearly Brighter SPF 15 Smoothing Moisturizer for 1 week now and I do like it. It is a light non-greasy refreshing scent and easy to apply moisturizer. My favourite part is that it has an SPF 15, but I also apply a sunscreen lotion with tint for extra protection. I do not have any fine lines yet, so I can't say if it helps with that but it did keep my skin well moisturized for the whole day. I would definitely recommend this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
To be fair the product only showed up a few days before this review so maybe I haven't been using it long enough before having to give my opinion of it. So all I can do is review it based on a few days use which in my eyes it isn't working. I will continue to use it in case it ends up proving me wrong but as of right now it is doing nothing for my skin. And for the prices I have seen it listed for it is not worth it at all. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product to review and WOW - I'm not sure I would have purchased it on my own but I'm certainly a believer now. I've only been using it for a few days now and I can see a difference in my skin tone already. In addition, the lotion goes on smooth and has a nice fragrance to it and doesn't leave a greasy residue. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"First off I love this products packaging. The twist pump is awesome no having air touching the proctor and, always the perfect amount to from the pump. My skin feels soft and supple after even a few uses. Only downside is it being scented. It isn't over powering but I prefer face products without a scent. This product was sent free for review purposes from chick advisor. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is a nice moisturizer with a pearly finish, leaving skin looking brighter with a light sheen. It works well under makeup. It has a bit of a scent, which I don't mind but might be trouble for some. All-in-all a decent product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product free from chickadvisor.I have been using it now for a few days and the first day I used it I could see my face look brighter and I can see a big difference since the first day I used it,will continue to use this product and will definitely be buying it.Thanks Chickadvisor!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
After a few uses I like the feel of the lotion. It is not heavy on my skin and I like that it does have a bit of sunscreen SPF 15. There is a slight scent but not over bearing. I will need to continue using to see if there is any change to my skin tone. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Thank you Chickadvisor for giving me the opportunity to review this product. I have to say that I really like this moisturizer. It feels creamy without being greasy (even though it has SPF). I really liked the way this moisturizer felt on my skin - it was smooth and moisturizing without feeling oily and I would definitely use it again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"When I started using the product my skin was really dry. After only for days using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizerm I already feel my skin hydrated and soft. I love the scent because it isn't too strong. The SPF is only 15, but I also were make up with 30, so If look for a daily moisturizer and doesn't mind about the SPF I will totally recommend. I received this product as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Love how this moisturizer felt on my skin! It moisturized my skin, without it feeling greasy, absorbed quickly, and helped even out my skin tone. The scent was mild, not overpowering at all. I like the fact that there's an SPF in it so I don't need to apply more lotion after. I don't know if it made my skin brighter, but my skin looked more even and healthy after using this moisturizer! I'd definitely buy this again! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received the following product from the ChickAdvisor review club. I loved the faint smell of this product along with how soft my skin felt while using it. I can't comment on how I think that it brightened my skin but since I use no makeup most of the time I have had a friend mention that I look much brighter.... So who knows. I've only been using the product just under 2 weeks now. I will definitely finish using this product and will seriouslu co soder keeping it as a routine. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Thanks for Sending me this product to try for free! I really like Garnier products and use many of them so I was excited to try this moisturizer. I do like the way it goes on, the mild scent and how easily it blends into the skin. Since I've only been using it for two weeks I can't comment on whether or not it's brightened my skin yet but I will definitely keep using it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This does not have a high enough SPF for me to want to continue using it, but it did leave my skin feeling soft, smooth and hydrated. The scent was not overwhelming and did not have that sticky residue typical of SPF products. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a daily moisturizer and uses another product for their sunscreen needs. I received this product as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Great smelling moisturiser. Good consistency. It's quite light, with a little 'greasy' feeling on the fingers, but doesn't have a greasy feel on the face. SPF built in so only for use during the day. Only used for 5 days but I've actually had 2 comments on how 'glowy' my skin looks! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am so pleased with the overall effect of using Garnier's SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer after a week. My skin now has even tone and a glow that I've never experienced before. I've tried many brands of moisturizers, most are the same results just average, but Garnier's new moisturizer hits it out of the park for me. This will be part of my daily routine now, a great addition!! Thank you Chick Advisor and Garnier!!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really loved the smell of this moisturizer and I noticed a nice shine type glow, brighter skin and a more even skin tone. The only thing I would probably be cautious about if you have sensitive skin is I did have a minor breakout when I first started using this product. While I would recommend this product because it wasn't greasy and did make my skin feel nice and fresh, I have seen similar moisturizers which do cost less than the price of this one. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I got this from Chickadvisor as a trial. I normally use an SPF 30 face cream for daily use. SPF 15 is better than nothing, but I'd prefer something a touch higher. I like that this face cream isn't greasy. It smells nice and goes on easily. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This brightening and smoothing moisturizer with SPF 15 was alright. I liked that it was light on my skin but I found it too fragrant. I did not notice a big difference after using it for a week, but I did find it as a good base under makeup. SPF 15 personally is not enough for me, I would rather go for something with at SPF 30. I'm not sure I would buy this product or recommend it to friends, but I'm willing to continue trying it for a few more weeks to see if I notice a difference! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This is a great moisturizer. Feels silky without being oily/greasy. I do find it adds a sheen to my skin but without looking oily. I've only used it during a Canadian winter, so I can't make any claims about the SPF working, but having sun-protection is always helpful. I would recommend this product to anyone who is willing to pay the price, which I find to the only downside to this fantastic moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I received Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I like it has light scent and has very creamy-watery texture. It is light and easy to apply. After applying my dry skin feels hydrated . In a while my skin became a little bit tight but it very smooth and velvety on touch. I don't have much time to see a brightening effect but as a smoothing cream it works great! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I received this product to review as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I loved how it moisturised my dry face and left it feeling smoother. The mild scent was not overwhelming. It is good for everyday wear but I do wish that it contained more spf. Overall I would recommend it to my friends since I think it is a great product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Received this as a PRC product and it is great! It glides on my skin well without leaving an oily feel. It smoothed out my stubborn dry skin patches around my cheeks that I normally get in the winter and I LOVE the scent! Will definitely buy this product again! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product for free as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. This product is very light, non greasy and fast absorbing. I have been using it for about a week now and I have noticed that my skin is smoother and more radiant. I will continue to use this product for weeks to come and I cannot wait to see the result after a more extended use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've only been using this moisturizer for a week, and I can already see a difference! It is so nice to have a product that not only improves the quality of your skin by brightening, but also protects with SPF. It's a winner! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Lovely scent! Skin feels amazing and is certainly not as dull with continued use. Not sure if it is helping my dark spots, but the first week has been promising. Wonderful that it has SPF in it...one less step in the morning. Fantastic product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I was thrilled to receive this product for review! I have combination skin which gets really dry in the winter time. This works perfect for a day moisturizer for my skin- it leaves my skins moisturized without feeling greasy. The product absorbs well into the skin, almost immediately when you apply it. I didn't notice the ""brightening"" effect, but it definitely does a good job in making my skin feeling soft throughout the day. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product to test and review through the ChickAdvisor review club. I have only been using this moisturizer for about 5 days, and although it is a reallly nice texture, and it does make my skin feel smooth, I have not noticed any of the brightening effect yet. It is a bit pricier than my usual moisturizer so not sure if I would keep using it after the trial bottle is gone or not... if I change my mind down the line, I will come back and update my review. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I got to try Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer as part of the Product Review Club. I liked the fresh scent of this moisturizer. It didn't feel greasy at all. I like that the moisturizer has spf but I would prefer a higher spf in my daily moisturizer. I find the price point high for this product. I would recommend this product if it had a higher spf and a lower price point. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was asked by ChickAdvisor to review this product, The Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing moisture.this is a lovely product. You do need very much of it a little bit goes along long way. My skin is so much more smoother, softer, I love it. What a differe ference a day makes so to speak. There is no doubt that I will be buying this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Days 1 through 4, worked well as per Garnier's claims it brightened and smoothed my face's skin. Day 5, my face went puffy and my eyes went red. I stopped using it immediately. I think I possibly have an allergy or intolerance to one or more of the active ingredients. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I tend to have very dry patchy skin, so I'm really picky with the face creams I buy. But I have to say, this moisturizer is amazing! My skin literally felt brighter and smoother from day 1 of using this product! I trust this product to keep my skin moisturized from morning to night! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received a sample of this to try and I was really excited because I don't think I've ever tried a moisturizer from Garnier before. I plan on buying the full size because I want to use it as my springtime moisturizer. It's lightweight, feels good to use before makeup or after washing my face at night."
"Was looking for a moisturizer with SPF and got a sample of this one in the mail! Only got 2 days out of the sample, but loved those two days! Smell was great, skin felt smooth and hydrated in the Phoenix Sun! Only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars would be cost but still would buy and see if it was worth the price! If it lasted!"
"I think this is a pretty nice moisturizer. I did not find it oily or thick and I liked the way that it felt when I put it on, lightweight and easy breezy. I have been using it for a week and I have not noticed any brightening, but I will continue to use and see if I do notice anything after more use. I like that is a has a light SPF. I think it is a great every morning choice! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product served as a decent daily moisturizer but wasn't anything spectacular. As mentioned by others, the low SPF value is counter productive to a brightening and smoothing cream. As well, the price is much higher than what I would expect for the size. After 1 week I did not notice any brightening. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've tried Garnier moisturizers before so I knew what kind of quality to expect. I wasn't disappointed! The product had a nice consistently and the scent didn't bother me. I think I'd have to use it longer to see whether it really ""brightens and smooths"", but otherwise I think it works well! I love that it has SPF, since that's a must for any daytime moisturizer I buy. I'd definitely consider buying this when I run out. Thanks for letting me try this, ChickAdvisor! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Pros - lightly fragranced (which isn't unpleasant) - absorbs quickly - non-greasy - hydrating - feels light on the face - love that it has some SPF protection (SPF 15) Cons - price is a little steep for a small bottle (75mL) Additional Notes: - not really sure how effective it is at brightening, but I feel like it does make my skin smoother (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this as part of the product review club. It goes on very well, absorbs well, and doesn't leave my normal-oily combination skin greasy at the end of the day. It is great under make up, which I usually find is an issue with moisturizers that have SPF in them. It is very fragrant, which I do not mind but may be an issue for others. I didn't notice the brightening, evening out effect that it promises. Overall, a great moisturizer even at the price of $20.99! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Got this compliments of chickadvisor and garnier. So I was a bit sceptical about trying a new moisturizer as my skin drys out so fast and needs tons of it especially in winter. However i found this worked pretty good. I didint need a huge amount like other products and seemed to last most of the day. It worked well under my.makeup as well. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Thank you Chick Advisor for giving me the opportunity to try this new product! Frist i love the pump bottle no finger in my cream.i enjoy the moisturizer.So easy to apply go's in the skin with out rubbing hard.I appreciate the sunscreen Inside cause even in the winter your skin is protect again the sun.I recommande this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I think it really feel like a sunscreen. Texture and smell . My skin is really smoother. For the bright... Maybe i'll have to use it longer to really see a difference. I love the bottle, cause i hate to put my finger in the cream(not really hygienic). I always love Garnier products it work well for me, but for this one, i'll keep it for the sunny days Thank you very much To ChickAdvisor for giving me the chance to try thisproduct for free (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product as part of the product review club and I was super excited to use it! My favourite part about it is that it includes spf, and is great as a daily moisturizer. My face feels moisturized but not sticky after applying, and it does seem to lighten my acne scars a bit! Awesome product, but a bit pricey compared to other drugstore brands. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I would say this cream is mediocre in terms of benefits compared to other drug store moisturizers. I have been using it for a couple weeks and I do like it but don't see any significant differences in ""brightness"" or the ""smoothness"". I feel like this is one of those products you have to use for at least 6 weeks before seeing any significant changes. The one thing I do like is the way my skin feels in the morning post using it at night before bed time! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love a skin brightener especially in the winter because my skin is dull. This works alone or under makeup. It's not greasy and it hydrates my skin. So far so good. Excited to see the long term results. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
LOVE THE SMOOTH FEELING AFTER THE APPLICATION. it is a great product to help my dry skin gets smooth and for makeup application. It is very gentle on skin and I can see my skin getting more radiant and smooth after a week use. Will definitely purchase this after I am done with this bottle (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Tried the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer as part of the Product Review Club and I loved it! I love how there is SPF in the moisturizer, yet it feels really light and non-greasy on my skin. It left my skin feeling light, smooth, moisturized, cool and refreshed. I also enjoy the light citrusy scent. :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I recently tried Garnier's SkinActive Clearly Brighter for free as a member of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club. I really like this moisturizer because it's light and not greasy. I can easily apply my make-up immediately following the application of this moisturizer which I can't do with many others. The scent is nice and the product leaves my skin feeling nice and soft. I really like this product and it falls much more within my budget than other equally great moisturizers. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I loved this product! Within 2 days of trying the product, I could visibly see my skin brightening and my fine wrinkles smoothing out. It is easy to apply and doesn't leave any sticky or oily residue like many moisturizers. I especially love the added SPF 15. I would definitely recommend it for any skin type. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"To be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this.....I was looking forward to trying another SPF moisturizer. This was very pleasant. It didn't make me break out, it didn't smell bad....did not go on greasy, and very well priced. :-) I can see using this in my regular rotation of moisturizers. Thanks Garnier and Chickadvisor for letting me try this product with a $1 donation. Cheers! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I am loving this moisturizer. when I wake in the morning my skin feels quite tight/dry. as soon as I apply the cream my skin feel normal again. This is definitely a product I would add to my shopping list! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I cant say how much i love the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Moisturizer its just wat i needed especially during the winter my skin tends to be really dry and gets age spots i cant seem to find a right moisturizer but this just wrks perfectly after using it for days i noticed my discoloration minimizing and my face feels smoother and softer its just perfect not greasy or sticky just love it!

"*I received this product as part of the ChickAdvisor Product Review Club* I really like this moisturizer. Its non greasy so its great under makeup and theres a some sunscreen in it. Wished it was 30 SPF though but not too bad. The smell is great as I love citrusy smells. Love the pump packaging, very sanitary. For the effect, I haven't really noticed any significant brightening but its a great little every day moisturizer! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love this moisturizer enough that I would recommend it to friends. It has a great light citrus smell. It absorbs very well. Not a greasing cream, and feels great under my makeup. I would definitely buy. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I received this product to trial as a ChickAdvisor. I'm always looking for a good moisturizer and this product fits the bill in terms of what it promises. I've been using it for about a week now, and the formula is great-smooth, just the right thickness, and doesn't leave my face feeling greasy or oily which a lot of moisturizers with SPF tend to do. I also find the smell pleasant, it's light and not overwhelming at all. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Another great drugstore product! I have been looking for a brightening face lotion and I think this might be it. I noticed it contained SPF which is great.. but then I was worried about the smell and the consistency. I pumped a little into my hand and it looked exactly like any other sunscreen product... I was SHOCKED when it went on sooooo smooth! It melts into the skin so easy with no hint of sunscreen scent. It's light and very moisturizing. I highly recommend it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
i received this product free from @ChickAdvisor to try. I've been using this product for almost a week. I love the feel of it but the smell i find a bit over powering. it does hide fine lines VERY well and leaves my face and neck moisturized. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I received this product from the product review club and have to say that I am on the fence about this product. I like the scent and it does what it says it does. It absorbs quickly which is what I like but I've tried a lot of moisturizers which I think have done just as well for a lower price point. Nevertheless, it is still a good product. I quite like it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Results seen on mature (60+) skin after applying the first couple days: age and sun spots fading; skin feels softer and looks brighter. After using every morning for two weeks, age spots have practically disappeared. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
Received this from ChickAdvisor in exchange for my review. Couldn't be happier! I have used other Brighteners with zero results. Garnier has definitely made a difference. Its only been a week but my skin looks definitely slightly better. I am sure that in time i will see more. My skin feels soft looks great. works well under makeup and without. Absorbs quickly. I did not find the scent to be overpowering. I will be buying this for sure! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I was a little sceptical about garnier at first. I don't like their shampoo and I was a unsure about this. Boy, am I glad I gave it a try! The moisturizer left my skin softer than ever and smelling fabulous. Can't wait to buy this. Will be worth every penny. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Couldn't wait to try this product as I am always looking for a product that will brighten my skin. I really enjoy this moisturizer because it has a very nice light texture and is great under makeup.

Just received this thank you Chick Advisor & already my skin feels amazing so thank you so very much for this!

Garnier Clearly Brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer is amazing!! It definitely brings out the natural glow in my face every morning! So glad it has a daily spf in it as well!

"I really like this moisturizer. It absorbs fast, isn't greasy or sticky, and has a light pleasant scent.

Another plus is the fact that a little goes a long way without feeling that your face is still dry. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I really liked this moisturizer. It felt good on my skin and I didn't have to worry about applying a sunscreen too on days I didn't wear my bb cream.

Loved trying this product. It is hydrating and gentle on my skin. I tend to have dry to combo skin and this helped the dry patches. I love the fact that it has SPF which makes it nicer for the summer months and just throwing it on the face to protect and hyrdate.

Usually moisturizers have an awful smell, but this actually has a light and beautiful scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF15 is one of the best daily moisturizer I have used.It shows brighter skin in just one week.

"I was worried that the heavy-perfume smell would translate to irritation on my face but it didn't. This is hands down the best moisturizer I've ever used. There are some moisturizers that are non-greasy that just feel like putting water on your face and in the end don't really do much. On the other end of the spectrum, there are moisturizers that feel like they're doing the job but are just ultra-greasy. This moisturizer, however, is one of a kind. It does it's job, my skin has never felt more hydrated, but leaves no greasy residue. I love it!"

I have used it everyday since i received it and I really haven't noticed any major differences in it for me to say yes my skin is truly better and brighter. It does absorb rather quickly into my skin, and doesn't leave it feeling like the moisture is just sitting on my face or as if it is oily at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is one of the best makeup remover and moisturizer I have tried! The makeup remover got off a bunch of dirt that collected under the makeup, which is something thats is usually hard to get and you sometimes cant tell all that dirt is there, but when you use this, you can definitely see it all. It also made my skin feel cleaner and soft which is something I always want after taking off a days worth of makeup. The moisturizer made my skin feel soft and definitely well moisturized.

"I can't give it 5 stars yet - only because I haven't tried it in the sun to see if the sun protection is real! Seriously, I love this moisturizer because it is so light. I hate feeling greasy and heavy and I couldn't even tell I was wearing it. Other moisturizers peel off or clump up when I rub my face (which I do a lot), but this stayed put. I didn't feel like it was attracting other gunk to my face either. I will be continuing to use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This is a great daytime moisturizer! It hasn't broken out my very sensitive skin which is amazing! My skin does feel smother after using this consistently! I love using this all on its own or under makeup. This is a great light moisturizer that isn't too heavy and it doesn't pill when I use it under makeup. I am not very good about remembering to put on spf on everyday, so this is a great way for me to get in my spf without having to worry about that added step.

I have a very hard time finding a moisturizer that works well for my skin. I have pretty oily skin so most moisturizers just sit there and leave my skin feeling oily and gross.

"I absolutely love this moisturizer. I've been using it a couple days now, and have noticed a difference. My skin looks more even, and brighter. My skin is very soft too. I also love it has sun screen in it! One less thing to apply. A+ Garnier, clearly brighter moisturizer."
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a great, light moisturizer that goes on easily and you can barely feel it once it's on. I'm not sure that I noticed brighter skin, but it did work comparable to other moisturizers that I have tried and I liked the added benefit of having sunscreen. The smell was light and refreshing and I would say it's a good daytime moisturizer or summer time one."
"I love that Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Dail Moisturizer makes my skin look brighter and helps even out my skin tone. I like how fast absorbing it is and that its not greasy. The extra benefit of SPF 15 lets me know that my skin is protected. After 1 week of use, my skin looks more even and bright!"
"As a member of Crowdtap, I received a free (#sponsored) sample trial of Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15! First off, I love the light refreshing scent. Second, I love that it has sun protection and is full of antioxidants - a complex of vitamin C & E, Pine Bark Essence, and gentle exfoliating Lipo-Hydroxyl Acid! After 1 week of daily use, my splotchy skin tone looks to be more even and my fine line seem to be fading! Five stars from me!"
"I have being using the daily moisturizer for a week now, and my skin look healthier. In a sense, i see a little brightness. But i am not a constant user also, once a day. Its adds a little glow to my skin, its even better with less makeup. It absorbs quickly when applied, not oily or smelly, there is a light scent to it but it is nice. I will continue to use it more regularly now."
"This moisturizer has an amazing smell. It is non greasy and semi light weight , a creamy texture that goes on smooth and leaves your face feeling very soft and refreshed for hours. I think this would be a good moisturizer to wear under make up especially since it has broad spectrum spf15. I was also pleased to find that I could apply this around my eye area without it being harsh and irritating my eyes."
I loved how well these products worked. The one that removes waterproof mascara I was overly impressed by. It is hard to find a makeup remover to get mascara off. I also loved how well it takes the dirt off of your face. Would highly recommend these products to friends and family!
"I loved how quickly this product soaked into my skin. It left no residue and my face felt moisturized. I like the added vitamins that it includes, as well. You don't need much at all and it spreads nicely on your face. The only negative thing I found, was it had a perfumey scent, which I felt was unnecessary for a facial product. It does not need to be scented or perfumey. I also don't think that would be very good for your skin. I will still use this product though because I liked the added vitamins and the sun protection."
"I love garnier brand, only dye I use so always love to find new favorites. The Brightening and smoothing daily lotion seems great so far. It's not greasy and absorbs well. I've not noticed a huge difference yet but I did notice my face feels better and that's always a plus. Seems to be a great value so far. I did get free for my honest opinion :)"
I really enjoyed the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I found it was easy to rub in and didnt leave a residue. It has made an improvemengt on my skin and I find it is less oily. The smell is very sutle so it doesn't overpower your senses. Great product.
this is by far the best moisturizer that i have ever used. others at the party got to try it out for a week and got back to me they were all impressed it doesnt leave your skin greasy and it doesnt feel caked on also we were able to put on makeup about 5 mins afterwards with no problem
"First, the scent of this moisturizer smells wonderful! Second, my face would like to thank Garnier for saving it from the cold, harsh, dry winter season we're currently experiencing. My face usually gets super flaky and even hurts during colder seasons because I'm prone to having dry, irritated skin, but this product does a fantastic job at preventing that! It leaves my face feeling moisturized and refreshed! It's going to help me keep that nice glow all year long! Thanks Garnier!"
I'm incredibly impressed with the Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer by Garnier. The name really does say it all. It goes on so smooth and moisturizes my skin so perfectly without leaving any kid of oily residue. But the absolute best part is how amazing my skin feels after using it. I applied it more than ten hours ago and my skin still feel soft and smooth!
Loved trying this product. It is hydrating and gentle on my skin. I tend to have dry to combo skin and this helped the dry patches. I love the fact that it has SPF which makes it nicer for the summer months and just throwing it on the face to protect and hyrdate. It is a thicker moisturizer to me than others I've tried but I haven't had any reactions and it's very soothing.
The Garnier Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer has got to be one of the best moisturizers I have tried. It truly leaves my skin feeling so silky smooth without an oily residue. Also the scent is amazing. I could honestly wear it as a perfume if Garnier made one with that scent. It is lovely!
I loved the scent of this product. It went on smoothly and left my skin feeling refreshed. It wasn't greasy and did not make make skin feel oily. A wonderfulmproduct to carry with me and use multiple times a day. My skin definitely looked bright and healthy.
"Love the three in one combination of sunscreen, moisturizer & brightening cream to help streamline my morning routine and tackle multiple issues with one easy application. The pump bottle is very convenient as I don't have to worry about losing the cap and it dispenses nicely; I don't have to worry about squeezing the entire tube out."
Garnier clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf15 is amazing. I absolutely love it. My skin looks 10 years younger. It works so fast in just one week you can tell the difference. My skin has improved so much. My wrinkles are almost gone. So easy to use. I love that it has sunscreen in it to protect my skin from uv rays
"Worked like a charm, I'm always hesitate of spf lower than 30spf because i have very fair sensitive skin but i used the product under my makeup while i was out at a baseball practice for my son and i didn't burn or peel like i normally would. It felt great under my makeup and didn't leave me feeling like my skin was oily or greasy or weighed down with sunscreen."
I absolutely love this product! The smell is amazing! I also liked how light weight it is- perfect under makeup. I love that it has sunscreen so I'm protecting while perfecting! I have definitely noticed that my skin looks brighter! I would highly recommend!
I am in love with Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I love that it has SPF15 in it because I live in Florida and I need the protection. It leaves me face soft and after a little over a week I noticed brighter happier skin. This is definitely replacing all the other moisturizers I use.
"The daily moisturizer was fantastic. It worked great with my combination skin. It had enough moisturizer to hydrate my skin but it didn't feel oily and thick either. The best part was that even after continuous use, my skin didn't break out or feel dry."
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a great daily moisturizer. It goes on silky smooth, doesn't feel heavy or leave a greasy, caked on feeling like many moisturizers do. It left my face feeling and looking visibly brighter. The added SPF15 is such a great addition to a daily moisturizer. I no longer need to put two products on my face in the morning. Highly recommended this!"

I am in love with Garnier's Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. The first thing that I noticed upon using was how good the moisturizer felt it was not greasy feeling at all. When I put it on my face it immediately soaked in and left my face feeling refreshed and soft. I liked how the scent is light and not over powering. After using this moisturizer for over a week I have noticed that the look and feel of my skin is better. My skin tone is brighter and my skin is more smooth.
I LOVE this product! Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer made my skin feel incredible. The winter has been very hard on my skin but since using this moisturizer my face has been so soft. It's light and leaves no residue on my skin. I also love the SPF so I'm protecting my skin as well as healing it. I have very sensitive skin & it does not irritate my skin at all. I've noticed my skin looks brighter and more vibrant since I started using this a few weeks ago. I will be buying this from now on.
"I didn't really know what to expect of this product as I was a little bit unclear about what it was actually for. I have a new job that has me in and out of the sun and salt water all day which really wears at my skin. I've started using just one pump of this in the morning and evening and I've seen a clear, dramatic difference in the quality of my skin. Not only is the moisturizer great, not oily, and smells good, but it also has a sunscreen to help protect it! I'm loving this product!"
I have been using the moisturizer for over a week and have noticed a difference in the overall appearance of my skin. I have gotten compliments on my skin. My face is definitely healthier looking. I will be adding Clearly Brighter to my new skincare routine
I loved using this product just as the description stated it did make my skin visibly soft and healthier. I love the clean feeling that this product provides and the smell is also very fresh. I also love how this is a non greasy product which really makes a huge difference.
I really like this facial moisturizer. It is smooth and easy to apply. My only issue with it is that it seems to leave my face greasy. I have extremely dry skin so I don't mind the greasy feeling that much. With in a week I have felt the difference in my skin. I will buy this product in the future.
"Ok so I actually took the whole month yo use the product before reviewomg because I wanted to see if my skin had any reaction to the product. The final conclusion was that it really actually cleared up my face . After using my make up Daily and only cleaning with water ,and alcohol the skin on my face felt totally open ,fresh and clean. It really truly works it clears skin of all make left over an actually cleanse deep down dirt. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed using this moisturizer. It had a lightweight formula that left my skin feeling clean and moisturized. It did not clog my pores or cause me to break out, which is always a plus!

"I love the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF14. When I look for moisturizer, I want one that doesn't leave your skin feeling oily. This doesn't at all!

I am a busy mom and sometimes I don't have time for several products, but this one product can replace several. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I really like this lotion, and I will be upfront in saying that I Was nervous to try it. Typically, any lotion with scent or SPF in it breaks out my skin. however, I have had not one single breakout since I began using the Skinactive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15. It gives the perfect amount of moisture to go under a creme makeup, and I love how smooth it makes my face feel after I use it, especially when combining it with a Garnier cleanser!

I loved how bright my skin looked after applying! I did not even need to apply anything else to my face. I also loved that it dried quickly so I could apply my makeup not long after. This is definitely a daily moisturizer that I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this moisterizer and so did my guests. Its light yet still moisterizing and leaves your skin feeling healthy and smooth. It has a nice almost green tea scent to it and I love that it has built in sunscreen for my fair skin. I like that it has vitamins and an exfoliating formula to smooth my 30's skin.

I have used alot of moisturizers and none of them ever seem to give me the results I need or want. I want something that not only keeps my skin soft but protects it and keeps it looking young and fresh. All of these qualities can be found in this tiny bottle. I really love my results and the scent is not bad either. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants more than just a moisturizer for a great price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After ONE use my skin already feels amazing! I can't believe how much softer my skin is, I've continued to use this product and it's like my completion is evening out. Oh by the way thanks for the SPF I don't even think about needing it unless it's summer time! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very impressed by the smell of this product. It doesn't smell like it even has SPF in it. Goes on smooth and my skin is brighter. What I don't like about it is that for it to work properly you have to apply every 2 hours and when I'm at work I don't have time for that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am a big person on smell, i dont like over powering smells but at the same time i dont like medicinal smells.Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 has a light pleasant smell that was perfect.

The moisturizer works good. When you first apply it it leaves your face feeling smooth. However I suffer from extremely dry skin and I had to reapply the moisturizer several times a day to continue to keep the smooth skin. I love the fact that it has spf in it already it takes that worry away. The packaging is eye catching and the bottle with the pump is very easy to use. I like it but it is not my favorite out of moisturizers I have used before. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer because it kept my skin from getting dry all day but wasn't greasy. I've used this for about two weeks now and have noticed my skin looking brighter. I'll definitely continue to use this product and I am excited to see if it helps even more in the sunny days. The only thing they could improve would be the scent, it was an okay scent but I prefer a cleaner scent in my skin products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This little bottle has lots of benefits. I was worried it would make my fave greasy because most moisturizer does. It left my face soft and nice. I don't like to wear sunscreen on my face because of the greasiness but I can now since this has spf in it. It smells great and lasts a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just love the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer! The scent was just right (not overpowering, which is important because I am sensitive to strong scents).

"I really enjoyed the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15, and so did all of my guests. Myself, and a couple of my friends have sensitive skin, so when it comes to Moisturizer I needed something that would be gentle, but would also be gentle enough for my skin as well. I liked how it smelled good, felt great on my skin, and blended into the skin well. It felt like it blended well and did not just sit on top of my skin.

The moisturizer is my new favorite. I had actually been looking for a new one and this one is great. I have been only putting it on the right side of my face just to see if I can see a difference and I can see more brightness on that side than the other. I actually noticed that before I read the bottle's claims. I like how lightweight it feels on my skin and that it doesn't clog my pores. I would recommend it to my friends.

This moisturizer is amazing! It makes my skin feel great and I really do think it has helped my skin in the time I have been using it. My friend whom I gave a sample to said she loves the smell! She is so glad that she was able to experience it and said when she ran out she would be looking for it at the store. So glad I was able to try this moisturizer.

"I've really enjoyed using the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Moisturizer. Though I have liked the product so far I haven't noticed that much difference in my skins overall appearance in the past couple of weeks of use. I will keep using it though because it is a good, non-greasy moisturizer that is light on my skin and has sunscreen to protect it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This is by far the one of the best moisturizers I've ever used in my entire life. The smell is great. The texture has a very creamy nice smooth touch to it. And I've definitely seen results quickly. My stubborn dark spots left from acne have always lighten and my face feels 100× smoother and refreshed and cleanse after I use it. This product doesn't clog your pores and will most definitely give quick results. I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Great product. Goes on smooth with a soft pleasant scent. It doesn't take a large amount to provide even coverage. Typically I experience drier skin during the cold months. I can honestly say that since using the moisturizer I have not had to apply more moisturizer during the day as I usually would. So far, so good. I plan to continue using the product. Phenomenal product for daily moisture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am in love with Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. Not only will it hydrated your skin, but it will protect it because it has SPF15. A little goes a long way. It leaves your skin refreshed, youthful, hydrated and doesn't leave a greasy feeling behind."
"Garnier micellar water all in one makeup remover os gentle, smells nice and a miracle worker. I have sensitive skin and I usually get rash if I use a strong makeup remover and if I don't then I would end up if makeup still on my face. With Garnier micellar, my fash was totally clean. No makeup residue and better than that, no allergic reaction! I definitely recommend it."
"I must start out by saying I absolutely love Garnier Skinactive Clearly Brighter Brightening &Smoothing Daily Moisturizer, it fees so light and airy on my face it doesn't feel heavy or greasy like some sunscreen can . And it moisturizes and brightens and leaves the face feeling so smooth all in one Wow What a score! !"
I'm loving this moisturizer. I can't really tell if it's really brightening my skin or not but it moisturizers pretty good. I also really like the scent. It smells citrusy and kind of lifts my mood. I received this product free for my review and I would totally buy it myself.
I love the moisturizer. Has a scent that I can stand. There are some moisturizers that just have a horrible scent. This one didn't. Made me skin smell good and made it feel super soft. It's a little greasy but not horribly greasy like other moisturizers I have tried. But I highly recommend this product.
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 does so many wonders. No other formula keeps your skin clean, bright, and non-irritated than Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. Plus with SPF15 its the best out there. I love how it keeps my face soft for hours and is made from gentle ingredients. This product is as pure as it can get. Love it!"
I love that this daily moisturizer has a built in sunscreen so I don't need to think about the needed spf protection. The locking pump cap will keep it from accidentally damaging something in my travel bag and the hint of citrus scent is lovely. It's. Ot greasy so there is no feeling like you need to wash up after using it. Wonderful product. I really enjoy it.
"After ONE use my skin already feels amazing! I can't believe how much softer my skin is, I've continued to use this product and it's like my completion is evening out. Oh by the way thanks for the SPF I don't even think about needing it unless it's summer time!"
i really like this product! it does wonders for your skin. my oldest daughters love using this. says it is so much easier to remove their makeup and leaves their skin feeling sooo fresh and smooth. they only have to spend mins when using this instead of what seems like forever using their old products.
I truly feel garniers clearly brighter facial moisturizers is one of the best out right now. After one application my face was so much smoother. After one week my skin is all around happier. I love that it already has sunscreen in it to help protect my face from the sun.
I absolutely love this moisturizer. It keeps my face moisturized in this climate without making my face oily causing acne. It has also helped with my fine lines. It also has SPF 15 to help protect me with the UV. This has helped my face so much and I love it. I am so glad I was able to try this for free and found a great product for my skin and now have a new skin care routine.
I liked that Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer went on smooth not oily worked in easily and did what it promised in a few days my skin was actually brighter it felt so much softer and I loved the smell of it too All around Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is a great product and you won't go wrong to try it!!
"I was glad that I was given this product for review because I was having so much trouble finding a sunscreen that worked for my oily skin. This one absorbed into my skin well and didn't leave a greasy residue. Also, I feel that my skin is a bit softer after using it."
"The more I use this moisturizer, the more that I like it! It does not leave my skin oily and that makes me really happy!! It has a faint-light scent and I really enjoy how light it is, and it really soaks into my skin. Everyone that I shared this product with absolutely loved it too! A little bit goes a long way, and I am really seeing a difference in my skin!"
Love this moisturizer. It was so easy to use. I love that it can be used daily and that it includes SPF. That is very important to me to keep my skin protected. It honestly did everything it claimed it would do as far as brightening and smoothing. My face is glowing now.
"I can't give it 5 stars yet - only because I haven't tried it in the sun to see if the sun protection is real! Seriously, I love this moisturizer because it is so light. I hate feeling greasy and heavy and I couldn't even tell I was wearing it. Other moisturizers peel off or clump up when I rub my face (which I do a lot), but this stayed put. I didn't feel like it was attracting other gunk to my face either. I will be continuing to use it!"
I was very impressed by the smell of this product. It doesn't smell like it even has SPF in it. Goes on smooth and my skin is brighter. What I don't like about it is that for it to work properly you have to apply every 2 hours and when I'm at work I don't have time for that.
"I just love the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer! The scent was just right (not overpowering, which is important because I am sensitive to strong scents). The moisturizer went on easily, and it is really important to wear a sunscreen year-round."
I like that it is light weight and that you don't need a whole lot to get the job done.It isn't greasy feeling.I like the how soft my face feels after using it. My face feels dry & tight after washing it & the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 makes it feel hydrated.
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a great face moisturizer. It comes in a very convenient pump bottle that lets you pump out just the right amount that you need for your face. It rubs in very easy and is not greasy. Its got a nice subtle clean smell to it and does a good job at keeping your face moisturized all day. I love that it also has SPF15 in it so that it helps protect against harmful UV rays, which in turn keeps my skin looking younger and smoother."
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is such a great moisturizer! I deal with breakouts and is hard to find a moisturizer that is oil free, but this one is! It makes my skin radiant without feeling heavy. I love that it also has SPF15 in it!"
The best moisturizer I have found thus far in my life! I have used very expensive ones that make all the cliche promises but this really moisturizes especially in the harsh winters it's like a big drink of water to my skin. And it brightens I would recommend this to anyone wanting a new moisturizer.
I love Garnier's Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer! It has a great light and clean scent and it goes on so nicely. It keeps my skin feeling moisturized and fresh all day long. I love that it has SPF 15 in in so that my extremely fair skin is protected from the sun as well.
"My skin gets really dry in the winter and I love the moisturizer it makes my skin soft and brightens my face up, it's really nice to have the spf 15 in it. Love the Garnier moisturizer for my face! I got this for free but my opinions are honest and my own."
I was chosen to host a party an share the opportunity to try Garnier moisturizer. it was great to have so many people enjoy this new product. After the initial use I almost instantly felt the hydration in my skin I liked that it is so easy to use and made my face feel so smooth
I loved the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. It works so well. leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft. It did not leave a greasy feeling like some other moisturizers do. My face is not dry feeling like it was before using Garnier. My face had spots that it was flaky and dry but in other spots had very oily spots. This has all cleared up since starting. I will continue to use this product. Then on top of that it protects from uv rays like a sun block that smells good and helps your skin!
"I liked the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer because it kept my skin from getting dry all day but wasn't greasy. I've used this for about two weeks now and have noticed my skin looking brighter. I'll definitely continue to use this product and I am excited to see if it helps even more in the sunny days. The only thing they could improve would be the scent, it was an okay scent but I prefer a cleaner scent in my skin products."
This is my new favorite moisturizer and SPF combination product! Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is a daily must especially with my sensitive skin being prone to the negative effects of the sun. I love how this moisturizer protects my skin and keeps it well hydrated. It dries quickly and soaks into my pores for a refreshing and revitalizing feeling!

"This is a great daytime moisturizer! It hasn't broken out my very sensitive skin which is amazing! My skin does feel smother after using this consistently! I love using this all on its own or under makeup. This is a great light moisturizer that isn't too heavy and it doesn't pill when I use it under makeup. I am not very good about remembering to put on spf on everyday, so this is a great way for me to get in my spf without having to worry about that added step."
"This is one of the best makeup remover and moisturizer I have tried! The makeup remover got off a bunch of dirt that collected under the makeup, which is something thats is usually hard to get and you sometimes cant tell all that dirt is there, but when you use this, you can definitely see it all. It also made my skin feel cleaner and soft which is something I always want after taking off a days worth of makeup. The moisturizer made my skin feel soft and definitely well moisturized."
"I love this product! Only one pump of it is needed to provide adequate coverage of my face and neck, it blends into the skin without leaving an oily or white residue, and still provides a bit of spf protection we all need when venturing out the door."
"I really love the scent, first off! You would think I was putting on some perfume or regular lotion. The scent is not overpowering at all, either.I noticed my skin looking a bit brighter and feeling a lot smoother.I loved the moisturizer-spf combination so I can get nice, smooth skin, and protect my skin from harmful sun exposure for a few hours.I would recommend this product to friends and family!"
"This moisturizer smells nice (but not overpowering). More importantly, it feels really nice, making my skin feel soft but not greasy. The low SPF is appreciated as I don't believe in coating my skin in SPF chemicals and try to stay away from them or keep them low."
I love this moisturizer for a variety of reasons and its going to be my new go to daily moisturizer! I love it because it left my skin feeling soft and smooth. It didnt feel heavy at any point and time and never felt like it appeared greasy! I hadnt used moisturizer for a few weeks prior to using this product and i love how fast it left my skin feeling hydrated and fresh!

The Clearly Brighter brightening & smoothing Dailt Moisturize is a broad spectrum SPF 15 sunscreen. It works quickly to help even out skin tone and texture. I've noticed my face looks a lot brighter after only a week of me using it. It works great and its oil free.
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 has a wonderfully pleasant scent. Appying on my skin was a breeze, it is light and absorbent and makes my skin feel very nourished. I can't wait to see the results in my skin texture & apperance after using for several more weeks. I'm very impressed with the healthy glow I feel after 4 days of use."
"Very light! My skin tends to be oily so I'm usually quite cautious about starting a new moisturizer. This one was lovely and light, no greasy feeling at all. It absorbs quickly so I don't have to waste a lot of time waiting around to put on my makeup."
"I use this moisturizer after my cleanser and before i apply makeup. First i would like to say that with my oily skin, i usually have trouble finding a good moisturizer that keeps my skin balanced and bright. Well, this one does just that. It keeps my skin soft and i am starting to notice my skin just looks healthier overall. It is the perfect everyday moisturizer and i would recommend to anyone"
"This is my new everyday daily moisturizer! Love that it has SPF 15 so I don't have to worry about applying sunscreen and the vitamin C definitely works because no more dull looking skin for me!

"I like the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF 15. It has a nice, light fragrance that isn't overpowering and it doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky or greasy. It's a good moisturizer for anyone dealing with dry, rough skin. I really like the fact that Garnier added SPF 15 to their Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer, because it helps make my beauty routine quicker and easier."
"I quite like this moisturizer, it doesn't have a strong smell, it soaks into the skin quickly, but not so quick that it doesnt feel moisturized, it leaves my skin smooth and hydrated and has a nice luminous finish. I would recommend this to a friend!"
"I was really impressed with this moisturizer. My current moisturizer does not have SPF in it, which I didn't realize some did. I love that it is moisturizer and sunscreen in one. It is gentle on my face and even smells good. A little bit also goes a long way with this, so one bottle should last a while. I can already feel the difference in my skin."
i love this product because it really works and does not brother my eyes at all. it does not have a strong smell and is does not leave my eyes looking all red from rubbing off the makeup. again i love this product i would tell everyone i know please try it really does work

The Micellar Cleansing Water is so refreshing and feels amazing after use. It removes makeup very easily and even mascara. Love love love it!"
I have a very hard time finding a moisturizer that works well for my skin. I have pretty oily skin so most moisturizers just sit there and leave my skin feeling oily and gross. Finding a moisturizer with spf is probably ten times harder. When I first tried this moisturizer I was so excited! It absorbed so well and left my skin feeling so soft and lovely. They smell was so pleasant and the added benefits were soo great. I could see this becoming my new go-to moisturizer!
We loved trying out Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15!

It does not have an off putting scent like moist facial moisturizers and our faces felt so soft and smooth with it on! This was definitely a hit product! Go Garnier!

"I love the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF14. When I look for moisturizer, I want one that doesn't leave your skin feeling oily. This doesn't at all!

I am a busy mom and sometimes I don't have time for several products, but this one product can replace several. I love it!"

The moisturizer works good. When you first apply it it leaves your face feeling smooth. However I suffer from extremely dry skin and I had to reapply the moisturizer several times a day to continue to keep the smooth skin. I love the fact that it has spf in it already it takes that worry away. The packaging is eye catching and the bottle with the pump is very easy to use. I like it but it is not my favorite out of moisturizers I have used before.
"I have been using the moisturizer for over two weeks and have noticed a difference in the overall appearance of my skin. I have gotten compliments on my skin from friends at school and coworkers.

I have used alot of moisturizers and none of them ever seem to give me the results I need or want. I want something that not only keeps my skin soft but protects it and keeps it looking young and fresh. All of these qualities can be found in this tiny bottle.

My face feels nice and smooth cleared up dry patch I had due to winter weather and did not clog my pores. After using for 2 weeks I can see how my face looks healthier and has a nice glow."
The moisturizer works good. When you first apply it it leaves your face feeling smooth. However I suffer from extremely dry skin and I had to reapply the moisturizer several times a day to continue to keep the smooth skin. I love the fact that it has spf in it already it takes that worry away. The packaging is eye catching and the bottle with the pump is very easy to use. I like it but it is not my favorite out of moisturizers I have used before.
"I have been using the moisturizer for over two weeks and have noticed a difference in the overall appearance of my skin. I have gotten compliments on my skin from friends at school and coworkers. My face is healthier looking and I love the ""glow."" I will be adding Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 to my new skincare routine! I also love that it has SPF because even in the winter, it is still important to use!"
"I really enjoyed using this moisturizer. It had a lightweight formula that left my skin feeling clean and moisturized. It did not clog my pores or cause me to break out, which is always a plus! I also really loved the scent of the moisturizer. It has a clean, citrus scent."
"I loved the feel of the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15,very easy to use,smells really good and made my skin very soft,smooth,refreshed.I love that it has SPF15 in it.Can put it on quick before I go out the door and know that my skin will be protected from the suns rays.It took my skin from being very dull to brightening my skin up,I love it."
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is a definite must have in anyone's beauty routine. It smelled fabulous and did exactly what was promised.. Visibly brighter and polished looking, however, doesn't just look this way, also feels this way. Beyond impressed!"
"I love it !! Within a couple of days my face was brighter, smoother and felt oil free and wasn't heavy. I usually put the moisturizer underneath my makeup and it feels like I have nothing on and doesn't clog my pores . One of my favorite moisturizers I have ever used"
I love this moisterizer and so did my guests. Its light yet still moisterizing and leaves your skin feeling healthy and smooth. It has a nice almost green tea scent to it and I love that it has built in sunscreen for my fair skin. I like that it has vitamins and an exfoliating formula to smooth my 30's skin.
"I am a big person on smell, i dont like over powering smells but at the same time i dont like medicinal smells.Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 has a light pleasant smell that was perfect. At the same time it felt light as well and didnt feel like it was cloggong my pores. Will recommend!"
I have used alot of moisturizers and none of them ever seem to give me the results I need or want. I want something that not only keeps my skin soft but protects it and keeps it looking young and fresh. All of these qualities can be found in this tiny bottle. I really love my results and the scent is not bad either. I highly recommend this product for anyone who wants more than just a moisturizer for a great price.
"I really like this lotion, and I will be upfront in saying that I Was nervous to try it. Typically, any lotion with scent or SPF in it breaks out my skin. however, I have had not one single breakout since I began using the Skinactive Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15. It gives the perfect amount of moisture to go under a creme makeup, and I love how smooth it makes my face feel after I use it, especially when combining it with a Garnier cleanser!"
This little bottle has lots of benefits. I was worried it would make my fave greasy because most moisturizer does. It left my face soft and nice. I don't like to wear sunscreen on my face because of the greasiness but I can now since this has spf in it. It smells great and lasts a long time.
I received a bottle of Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer to try for free for my honest opinion of the product. I like the way it goes on my face and seems to go on smoothly. It doesn't leave an oily or shiny face after use. I also like the way it smells. This product has SPF 15 to protect your skin from the sun. I like that feature alot. During the winter months people don't realize that our exposed skin can still receive harmful UVA rays. Having a moisturizer that has spf 15 in it is great.
"I am loving this moisturizer. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling smooth and lightly hydrated, without being greasy or oily. That's really important to me because I have combination skin with some oily areas. I can wear out alone or under makeup, and my foundation goes on smoothly. In addition to evening out my skin, this moisturizer smells fantastic!"
Awesome! I loved this product. It was easy to use and wasn't greasy at all. I loved the fact it had sunscreen in it (one less product to have to worry about). My skin was brighter and more radiant after several uses. It is small enough to be portable but also last a very long time.
"This cream is so smooth, and applies without any tugging whatsoever! It lasted all day, which was a huge surprise to me. I usually experience flakiness from dry skin a few hours after applying moisturizer and make up. I love that this has sunscreen, and it smells so good! I'm very happy with my experience with Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15."
"Loved the way this garner daily moisturizer makes my face feel. So soft and fresh and there is spf in it, perfect combo. I also appreciate that there is no smell, my skin is very sensitive and I need to use products with light smells and this was perfect. So happy to continue to use this and see if it makes a great difference to my skin."
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 is a great daytime moisturizer. SPF 25 gives you daily sun protection necessary to keep wrinkles at bay. Antioxidants of vitamins C & E plus lipo-hydroxyl acid provide a smoother & more radiant complexions, as early as one week. For around $14.99 and available in most big box and drug stores this works as an excellent daily multi-function moisturizer for most."
"I loved it because it doesn't feel like other products that boast the same effects. It's lightweight and not runny at all, plus the light green apple scent is to die for. My skin felt breathable, brighter, & softer yet it felt protected. It definitely lives up to the Garnier reputation!"
"The girls in my household and my friends at work have been using and trying out the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Mousturizer and are loving it!! I tend to have dry skin, especially in the Winter and this has been helping tremendously!! I love that you don't need to use a lot of it at one time and it isn't greasy at all. My daughter has acne issues and it does not bother it at all!! My coworkers are loving it!! Thank you Garnier and Crowdtap!!"
I love this daily moisturizer. I got a chance to try this product to test and keep from #crowdtap. The product has a light and not oily texture. I can apply it to my face without any worries. It has a fresh smell that my nostrils can handle and all of my friends are enjoying the results. They explained a radiant and brighter outcome. I agree because I have also experienced the same things.
I loved how bright my skin looked after applying! I did not even need to apply anything else to my face. I also loved that it dried quickly so I could apply my makeup not long after. This is definitely a daily moisturizer that I will continue to use.
"This product was unexpectedly great. From the fact that it was SPF 15 to the scent, to how light it felt when applied, it is overall a great moisturizer. I actually stopped using my other daily face moisturizer to use this one instead because of how well I liked it."
"I am so glad I was able to try this product because my skin gets dry in the winter. I really like the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 because it's not greasy, I don't have to use alot, my skin feels moisturized and soft, and it smells really good. I just started using it and looking forward to really seeing results but so far so good :)"
"This is a great daily moisurizer that feels great while wearing, and lasts all day! I loved that it wasn't a heavy feeling product, and it wasn't greasy at all. I found that it absorbed pretty quickly into my skin, and smelled good too! I love that it already has SPF included so I don't have to use multiple products on my face. After using for a few weeks I notice that my skin is softer and my complexion is better overall."
"Ok so I actually took the whole month yo use the product before reviewomg because I wanted to see if my skin had any reaction to the product. The final conclusion was that it really actually cleared up my face . After using my make up Daily and only cleaning with water ,and alcohol the skin on my face felt totally open ,fresh and clean. It really truly works it clears skin of all make left over an actually cleanse deep down dirt."
"I thought this was a great product! I love using Garnier facial care products, and this is no exception. It goes on easily and absorbs well. I like that it has the SPF15 in it to keep my skin safe from the harmful sun rays, especially since I live in Florida and spend lots of time outside in the sun. It does a great job of moisturizing my skin, and leaves it feeling and looking soft, smooth and radiant."
"I really do love the way this moisturizer makes my face feel during the day. I put it on in the morning and throughout the day on days I am outside. It really does leave my face feeling really soft and smooth, I will continue to use it to see if there is any change on the brightness [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am impressed by Garnier Clearly Brighter Brigtening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I applied the moisturizer to one side of my face to see if there was a noticeable difference.

Its non greasy, lightweight product and smells refreshing. I love everything about this product. Thank you so much crowdtap and garnier for the opportunity to try this product for free...

I have always been an avid user of Garnier skin-care products since it's inception. The SkinActive Brightening Moisturizer by Garnier did not let me down either. My skin is noticeably toner and smoother! I have been on a Vitamin C kick lately and knowing it causes skin sensitivity having to wear a separate moisturizer with SPF. With the SkinActive Moisturizer it has both Vitamin C and SPF 15. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I really enjoyed this moisturizer. This moisturizer was not over dry and left my skin feeling so soft and smooth after one use. After a week I saw major results with my skin.

"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 left my skin feeling soft and smooth.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recently tried the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF15 and so far love the results that I am seeing. My skin looks definitely brighter and smoother - it does not leave behind that greasy feeling at all.

Am in LOVE [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great moisturizer! It goes on nice and smooth as well. The best part of this moisturizer is that unlike some others that have a sunscreen in it this moisturizer doesn't feel thick. It is still lightweight. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This did a great job making my skin look brighter in the morning and I really love that it has spf in it. Sun damage is the worst aging agent of skin so any product that I can use everyday and know I'm protected with spf on top of the other benefits is a win win. I had no irritation from this product either. Made my skin softer and brighter after using [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved the clean fresh scent and the lightness of the moisturizer. It didn't feel like I was rubbing lard on my face, and the predetermined dispenser amount was the perfect amount, not too much lotion but not too little. I would recommend to all my friends with any skin type. I have sensitive skin and the clearly brightening moisturizer did not cause me to break out.

Clearly Brighter by Garnier Skin Active was very nice to put on after cleansing our faces with Micellar Cleansing Water. It was rich and creamy and did not feel greasy. Our skin was noticeably brighter. I have used for a couple of days now and I can tell the difference in my face not feeling dry. I will buy and use in summer time as well. #Crowdtap #Sponsored #ActiveIsBetter #GarnierSkinActive [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin, it looks much healthier. This did not break my skin out, which I really appreciated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product was easy to apply to the skin thanks to the pump on the bottle. Moisturizers that come in a jar can be annoying and messy. It does have a pleasant smell and I give it 4 stars only because it is too light for my skin type in the winter. My skin did feel moisturized but for only half of the day. I will still continue use it twice a day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the Garner Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. I love that it is SPF 15. The scent is amazing.

This is a nice gentle moisturizer. It rubs in easily with no greasy or waxy residue. It just leaves your skin feeling soft and looking refreshed.

"Lightweight and quick absorbing , this moisturizer is great on it's own like on a day when I'm hitting the gym with no makeup on . My skin looks healthy and moisturized and I love the addition of SPF. Under makeup it's also great because it's not oily and doesn't make my foundation slide around. The pump dispenser is very convenient too. I'm looking forward to the brightening effects too since it's only been 3 weeks since I started using it.

"I like this stuff! I honestly haven't noticed a difference in my skin though.

The formula for the moisturizer is perfect. I have gone through product after product looking for a lotion with this type of viscosity ever since Clean & Clear stopped making the one I loved. It goes on light and absorbs quickly into skin. It plays well with make up and never makes me feel like my pores are clogged. I'm so happy to finally have found something that makes me this happy again :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I would recommend this daily moisturizer to everyone, with all skin types! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Absolutely a 5 star product in my book! Left my skin feeling soft and smooth and not greasy. I tend to have oily skin and shy away from most moisturizers as they tend to leave my face looking shiny and oily as the day goes on. However, I found that not to be the case with the Clearly Brighter product. My skin remained oil free through out the day and my make up went on smoother and lasted longer. A great product!!

I will definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the moisturizer and so did everyone I introduced the moisturizer to! I can definately see the difference. My skin is much brighter now since I have started using this product. It goes on smooth and leaves my skin feeling very soft and moisturized without leaving it feeling oily or greasy at all! I love that it is also sunscreen which is something I often go without because it is so oily on my face but thanks to this moisturizer I will be ready for the sun this summer!

I was given the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer to sample for free. First I noticed a very pleasing light scent. I have oily skin & typically when I use moisturizers my skin feels greasy & slick. This moisturizer made my skin feel silky & smooth! I like the fact that it will also brighten my skin over time & use. I'm very pleased with the fact that there is SPF 15 in it also to protect my face from the sun on a daily basis.

Gives my skin a nice natrual glow. I can't tell if it's helping my dry skin or id there has been any improvements yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm not one for face lotion because I have oily skin. When I tried Garnier Clearly Brighter & Smoothing Moisturizer I was in shock that it didn't leave my face greasy or sticky. It soaked right in and left my face feeling smooth and soft, as well as leaving a very nice smell. It also has SPF 15 to keep you protected without feeling like the thick oily sunscreen. I would recommend this daily moisturizer to everyone, with all skin types!"
I really like the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. It is light yet moisturizing. It also has a pleasant scent. I've noticed my skin texture is smoother and more even since using it. Everyone I shared it with has said how much they enjoy it as well.
"i found this to be amazing! i used it for about a week and noticed my skin was shinier and looked so good, even other people were askign me about the products i was using on my face. I love the fact it has a mild smell doesnt go on thick or greasy and protects from the sun. It also has great daily benefits for your skin"
"My mom said she loved it. It makes your skin more brighter and have a healthier skin. Looking great plus helps your skin from all that bad sun. It even moisturizers your skin which is pretty good. It has a lot of benefits all in one which is just awesome. Who doesnt want to look great, fresh, smooth, moisturized, and sun damage free! This is also great for your skin so later on it wont get more damage from the sun."
Clearly Brighter by Garnier Skin Active was very nice to put on after cleansing our faces with Micellar Cleansing Water. It was rich and creamy and did not feel greasy. Our skin was noticeably brighter. I have used for a couple of days now and I can tell the difference in my face not feeling dry. I will buy and use in summer time as well. #Crowdtap #Sponsored #ActiveIsBetter #GarnierSkinActive
"I love the clean, fresh scent of this since scent is a big factor in whether I can use a product. The consistency is light and absorbs into my skin quickly. My skin feels soft and moisturized and I appreciate the spf in the product for use during the day."
"I've really enjoyed using the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Moisturizer. Though I have liked the product so far I haven't noticed that much difference in my skins overall appearance in the past couple of weeks of use. I will keep using it though because it is a good, non-greasy moisturizer that is light on my skin and has sunscreen to protect it."

Garnier clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer works great it made my skin feel good and protected. I love that it didn't made my face feel oily like other skin protectors ..i will keen on using Garnier because it has prove me wrong and i been using the wrong skin protector!
This is by far the one of the best moisturizers I've ever used in my entire life. The smell is great. The texture has a very creamy nice smooth touch to it. And I've definitely seen results quickly. My stubborn dark spots left from acne have always lighten and my face feels 100× smoother and refreshed and cleanse after I use it. This product doesn't clog your pores and will most definitely give quick results. I highly recommend this product.
"I am impressed by Garnier Clearly Brighter Brigtening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I applied the moisturizer to one side of my face to see if there was a noticeable difference. To my surprise: there was! On the half where I applied the product, my skin actually had a healthy glow and felt very smooth and wonderful. The second half matched the first. I was extremely pleased!"
"I really do love the way this moisturizer makes my face feel during the day. I put it on in the morning and throughout the day on days I am outside. It really does leave my face feeling really soft and smooth, I will continue to use it to see if there is any change on the brightness"
"My skin is looking great! I've really enjoyed using this moisturizer. It goes on easily and soaks into my skin. My husband has even commented that my skin looks different, for the better! I have been looking for a moisturizer that actually does it's job without leaving my face oily and this one is definitely it! I will be using this everyday from now on. Thank you Garnier!"
This moisturizer is amazing! It makes my skin feel great and I really do think it has helped my skin in the time I have been using it. My friend whom I gave a sample to said she loves the smell! She is so glad that she was able to experience it and said when she ran out she would be looking for it at the store. So glad I was able to try this moisturizer.
"It has a delightful light airy floraly scent. Silky smooth, not heavy. Leaves my skin soft and silky and more vibrant, not greasy at all. Keeps my skin moisturized all day. Has done wonders for my dry facial skin. Winter air can be so harsh. Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing daily moisturizer combats that."
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 is a wonderfully thick lotion that really needs to be worked into the skin due to it's SPF component. It's rich texture smooths and brightens my skin, and I would highly recommend this product to anyone who likes the addition of an spf in their face lotion as it is a great double featured item!"
"I really like the Garner Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. I love that it is SPF 15. The scent is amazing. I was shocked because it smelled so nice, but the scent isn't too strong which I like. I usually apply the moisturizer in the morning and it would keep my skin soft and silky the entire day. I especially like that it is light and that it easily absorbs into my skin. Overall, I love the moisturizer!"
"I like this stuff! I honestly haven't noticed a difference in my skin though. It may be because I have very dry skin and have to use a thicker cream moisturizer in the winter months so have to apply that after. Overall, I really like it. I hope it becomes a favorite in the warmer months."
"This is one of the best daily moisturizer i have ever tried. I have a mildly sensitive skin that wouldn't easily accept a new trial but this clearly brightening moisturizer was as gentle as a touch of water, it leaves my skin very smooth with a hint of glowing! Am in LOVE"
I absolutely loved Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It is possibly on of the best facial moisturizers I have ever used. It left my face feeling moisturized and smooth just like it said. I also love that it has SPF 15 in it so I know my face is always protected.
The formula for the moisturizer is perfect. I have gone through product after product looking for a lotion with this type of viscosity ever since Clean & Clear stopped making the one I loved. It goes on light and absorbs quickly into skin. It plays well with make up and never makes me feel like my pores are clogged. I'm so happy to finally have found something that makes me this happy again :)
"I used the garnier clearly brighter brightening and smoothing daily moisturizer with SPF 15 for 10 days straight so far and I can tell a big difference in how smooth my face feels and the dark spots are fading leaving me with a clearer radiant complexion. Its non greasy, lightweight product and smells refreshing. I love everything about this product. Thank you so much crowdtap and garnier for the opportunity to try this product for free..."
Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily moisturizer is a must have for all women. It left my skin feeling refreshed and smooth. Not only that but I feel that my skin no longer looks dull. To me it looks more radiant. I couldn't be more happier.
"I really enjoyed this moisturizer. This moisturizer was not over dry and left my skin feeling so soft and smooth after one use. After a week I saw major results with my skin. I love how light this moisturizer is on my skin, it doesn't feel like I am wearing anything! I would defiantly buy again!"
"I really like the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF15. It keeps my face moisturized and feeling smooth and healthy all day, and it gives my skin this really awesome glow. It's not greasy and it absorbs right into my skin, and the SPF15 keeps my face protected from the sun."
Moisture moisture moisture! My skin gets so dry in Florida but it really helped prevent the cold morning air from sucking all of the moisture out of it. the packaging is clear and makes the product look nice. I think it's a great size and a quality product for sure!
"I loved the clean fresh scent and the lightness of the moisturizer. It didn't feel like I was rubbing lard on my face, and the predetermined dispenser amount was the perfect amount, not too much lotion but not too little. I would recommend to all my friends with any skin type. I have sensitive skin and the clearly brightening moisturizer did not cause me to break out."
The moisturizer is my new favorite. I had actually been looking for a new one and this one is great. I have been only putting it on the right side of my face just to see if I can see a difference and I can see more brightness on that side than the other. I actually noticed that before I read the bottle's claims.I like how lightweight it feels on my skin and that it doesn't clog my pores. I would recommend it to my friends.
I am in love with the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer! The scent is really great! A lot of moisturizers that have sun screen in them smell funny but this one smells nice. I also love how smooth my skin feels after I use it.
"I have been using this product for almost a month and I have to say I am impressed. My skin is moisturized and feels refreshed, and does look brighter and more radiant. Living in the Sunshine State I love that I can Moisturize and protect my skin from the sun all in one product. I have actually received several compliments with no makeup on since I have been using it. I will definitely be repurchasing this product and recommending it to friends and family."
This did a great job making my skin look brighter in the morning and I really love that it has spf in it. Sun damage is the worst aging agent of skin so any product that I can use everyday and know I'm protected with spf on top of the other benefits is a win win. I had no irritation from this product either. Made my skin softer and brighter after using
"As unbelievable as it sounds, my skin felt smoother and looked brighter after the first night of use. I looked years younger. I didn't think my skin could look that healthy again. It was almost a peaches and cream complexion. I was surprised and thrilled with the results. With continued use, my skin tone and texture improved and I look younger than I have in years."
The Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF15 is terrific! I love that it has SPF in it yet it isn't heavy and doesn't clog my pores. In just over a week my skin looks brighter and feels healthier and more radiant!
Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15.I s a great new product. It gives my face a healthy glow. Is like enough to use in all seasons and is not greasy like some other brands. It has a light scent but not overwhelming.
I recently tried the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF15 and so far love the results that I am seeing. My skin looks definitely brighter and smoother - it does not leave behind that greasy feeling at all. It's perfect in the mornings before you apply your makeup - and I love how it has SPF15 in it so you are protected throughout the day from more damage from the sun.
I am in love with the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer! It truly has brightened and smoothed my skin. It has brought my skin to life and I feel like I have a glow again. I also love the fresh scent. This is my new favorite and go to moisturizer!
In few words - an excellent product! As a member of Crowdtap I had the opportunity to try and share with my friends the Garnier's Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. I liked the light citrusy scent. I like the lightness of the cream and that its not leaving any greasy feeling. My skin is looking great and soft and I love it!I will definitely recommend this product.
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 left my skin feeling soft and smooth. I normally don't use SPF products throughout the year because I hate the greasy feeling they leave, but I didn't really notice that with this moisturizer."
"Absolutely a 5 star product in my book! Left my skin feeling soft and smooth and not greasy. I tend to have oily skin and shy away from most moisturizers as they tend to leave my face looking shiny and oily as the day goes on. However, I found that not to be the case with the Clearly Brighter product. My skin remained oil free through out the day and my make up went on smoother and lasted longer. A great product!!"
This moisturizer is pretty fabulous. I have combination skin that is prone to breakouts and had no issues while using this. My skin is noticeably softer. My skin tone and complexion are also more even after using this. This will definitely be a moisturizer that I continue to use.
"Great product. Goes on smooth with a soft pleasant scent. It doesn't take a large amount to provide even coverage. Typically I experience drier skin during the cold months. I can honestly say that since using the moisturizer I have not had to apply more moisturizer during the day as I usually would. So far, so good. I plan to continue using the product. Phenomenal product for daily moisture."
"This moisturizer leaves your skin so smooth with a non-greasy feel. In one step I can moisturize my face, add the SPF 15, and improve my skin tone, texture, and even help reduce any wrinkles on my face. I love that it does it all for me and I don't have to have 5 different bottles to accomplish the same goals. The moisturizer has Vitamin C & E which we all know healthy glowing skin requires some vitamins. Within a week I saw improvements on my skin tone and the texture (dryness) of my face."
This is a nice gentle moisturizer. It rubs in easily with no greasy or waxy residue. It just leaves your skin feeling soft and looking refreshed. My sister has sensitive skin and it still worked well for her with no bad effects. The fact that it has a built in sunscreen is an added bonus!
"My friends and I all agreed that this lotion is amazing! It absorbs quickly into your skin and leaves it feeling fresh and moisturized, not at all greasy. It has a fresh, clean scent that is very pleasant and it's just enough to not bother you. 2 of my friends that tried the Clearly Brighter moisturizer have sensitive skin and they used the lotion with no issues at all - their skin didn't have any adverse reactions! I really like that it has SPF in it as that is something I prefer, especially in the warmer months when I'm outdoors often."
This product was easy to apply to the skin thanks to the pump on the bottle. Moisturizers that come in a jar can be annoying and messy. It does have a pleasant smell and I give it 4 stars only because it is too light for my skin type in the winter. My skin did feel moisturized but for only half of the day. I will still continue use it twice a day.
"I don't usually use a facial moisturizers or sunscreen because of reactions or just the quality of products. I'm loving this one, however. It absorbs almost immediately, and doesn't leave any oily or unpleasant residue. It's so light that after applying, you can't really tell that it's there at all. I love that!I also have a load of qualms about the fragrances of products, and this one smells great. It's fresh and light, not even remotely overwhelming. It's actually a sunscreen, but it sure feels like a quality moisturizer."
I have always been an avid user of Garnier skin-care products since it's inception. The SkinActive Brightening Moisturizer by Garnier did not let me down either. My skin is noticeably toner and smoother!I have been on a Vitamin C kick lately and knowing it causes skin sensitivity having to wear a separate moisturizer with SPF.With the SkinActive Moisturizer it has both Vitamin C and SPF 15.
"Lightweight and quick absorbing , this moisturizer is great on it's own like on a day when I'm hitting the gym with no makeup on . My skin looks healthy and moisturized and I love the addition of SPF. Under makeup it's also great because it's not oily and doesn't make my foundation slide around. The pump dispenser is very convenient too. I'm looking forward to the brightening effects too since it's only been 3 weeks since I started using it."
"I really enjoyed the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15, and so did all of my guests. Myself, and a couple of my friends have sensitive skin, so when it comes to Moisturizer I needed something that would be gentle, but would also be gentle enough for my skin as well. I liked how it smelled good, felt great on my skin, and blended into the skin well. It felt like it blended well and did not just sit on top of my skin."
This moisturizer is the best! I loved the smell and how my skin felt after using it. I have very sensitive skin and have to be careful about what I use and this was absolutely great for it. My skin has never felt so hydrated. Thank you Garnier for creating such wonderful products!
it is the best i haave ever used in my life your skin feels like silk when you put it ion and my skin has changed so much since i have been using it i love it and will by this for the rest of my life it actually makes your dull lifeles skin bright and beautiful i would tell the world to stop using whatever brand they use and start using garnier clearly brighter brightening and smoothing daily mosturizer
"I have to say that this has been one of my favorite product when it comes to facial lotion. Given my sensitive sick, the moisturizer has not irritated my skin but has left it smoother and has even out my skin tone. My skin looks healthier and better then ever."
"Usually SPF 15 products are too heavy on my skin and reek of suntan lotion. When I initially applied it it felt heavy, but it absorbed quickly and didn't leave my skin feeling weighed down. It actually left it feeling very soft and smelled nice! I used it more as a daily moisturizer, underneath my makeup, than as a sunscreen, applying it only once in the morning. It worked well enough that I didn't feel the need to keep reapplying it throughout the day which really says something with the cold weather we've been having lately."
"This moisturizer left me skin feeling much better throughout the day than my previous moisturizer. I wear this on days where I do and where I don't wear makeup. I have noticed a difference in the appearance of my skin, it looks much healthier. This did not break my skin out, which I really appreciated."
Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 made my skin feel so soft and smooth after just one day! It was also very easy to apply and soaked into my skin in a short amount of time. Cannot wait to see how it will work on my fine lines and wrinkles after using it for a week! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product, It is light weight and easily absorbed through the skin i forgot that i even put it on. It has a nice scent to it and does smell like sunscreen but not like the regular sunscreen smell. Makes my skin feel nice i think i will be switching from my olay moisturizer to garnier :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter Moisturizer is an absolutely wonderful product! First off it feels lightweight on your skin.

"I am so thankful to CrowdTap for sending me the samples of the facial moisturizer, because I really love it. I have very fair skin and get sunburn easy. I also tend to suffer from dry skin. This moisturizer felt great on my face, not greasy or irritating. I love that it did not have a strong scent because that really bothers me. Everyone who I shared these with really liked them as well, and had great things to say! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm impressed with the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15, it has a nice light consistency, that absorbs in your skin, moisturizing and refreshing, without feeling heavy or greasy.

I love the SPF factor, there is no need to worry about adding this later as it is already on! Great daily lotion! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

After a couple of weeks, the tone of my face was more even. My dark circles under my eyes lessened, as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first my girls and I did not realize that this was a sunscreen, but we were excited to find out that it was and that we could use it any time, not just as a moisturizer after washing our faces. After using this product a few days we noticed that our skin was soft and even while still giving it a light youthful feeling. Another thing that we liked about this product was that it did not have that ""sunscreen smell"". [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this lotion! I have been using it daily and I can already see an improvement in my skin tone, its more even and feels very soft.

"This is a light moisturizer that absorbs quickly. Although I haven't noticed lightening of my sun spots or more evenness in my skin tone yet, I know this takes time. This moisturizer has a subtle yet pleasant citrus fragrance. A big plus for me is that it also has an SPF of 15. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This moisturizer just makes my skin feel good. It is a good mixture of sunscreen and a light moisturizer. It goes on easily and my makeup applies easily and evenly after I apply the moisturizer. I am a fan of Garnier products in general. And, this product is no exception. It comes in a small pump bottle that is handy to carry with me while travelling.

My skin tends to look duller in the winter months but after using this new product, I've actually had friends ask what I'm doing differently and if I'm using different make-up because I look brighter and more awake. This is a great product for everyday use that I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review. I received this product a few weeks ago and started using it right away. I have noticed a change in how my skin looks and feels. It is hard to explain, but my skin doesn't quite feel the same anymore. It seems more lively and clean. That is not to say my face wasn't clean before. The feeling of it being clean lasts longer than with my old routine. I am in love with this product and will be buying more in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Garnier Micellar Cleansing Water works great on my face as well as neck removes makeup and grime just by simply placing on area that needs to be cleaned and it leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'll definitely liked using the Micellar Cleansing Water daily. It did the job, leaving my face clean and refreshed. I wasn't too clear about the Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer, is it a skin brightener, a sun screen, or both? I was a little confused. It seemed more like a sunscreen to me. In my opinion, by reading the directions on the back it made the product a sunscreen and not a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The lotion came out of the dispenser easily. You never got too much. Also it was easy to smooth onto skin. My skin didn't feel greasy and the lotion absorbed fast. I also love that there is SPF as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really love this product! I've used daily moisturizers before with SPF in them and they usually are hard to rub in completely. Sometimes it seems to leave a white layer that doesn't go away easily. Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 absorbed very quickly and left my skin soft. I've been using it for a couple weeks and my skin looks great. I have sensitive skin and I haven't experienced any breakouts or redness. I'm making the switch! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Gave me more confidence which gave me more energy to start my day! Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed using the garnier cleanser because it has more than one use, like cleansing the face before putting make up and for removing it. There really is no need to rub hard to remove the make up it comes off in one wipe. The Moisturizer is brightening, smoothing, refreshning and protective. The smell is pleasant to wear through out the day, long lasting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I like that this product doesn't leave my skin greasy feeling, After using products that do I usually wake up with a new blemish after applying. I like that it's both a moisturizer and a sunscreen, so that I don't have to worry about putting on two different things. So far, it appears to be working ,the results are not dramatic but my skin is looking nice and feeling soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It definitely does it's job as a moisturizer and makes my skin feel refreshed. An added bonus that I really like is that it has the low SPF for your neck and face when you use it. I have another product that I use that requires I use a skin product with SPF, so this is awesome to have. Would suggest to anyone as a daily add in to your regular skin treatment. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this up until my party and I love it. I have a more balanced complexion and my Fiance' absolutely loves the smell. He is always smelling my face and neck and going ga ga over how good I smell. I will buy it based just on this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I need my moisturizer to have spf in it and also not destroy my ultra sensitive skin... this did both! It went on smoothly without leaving that gross oily residue feeling that sometimes comes alone with moisturizers. I feel like it provided me with the coverage that I needed and left my skin feeling soft as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I'm a huge Garnier fan so I was quite excited to get to try this new Clearly Brighter moisturizer. Let's start off with how wonderful it smells. It has a slight citrus fragrance but it's not harsh. The smells are perfectly balanced. The product is oil free so it's not heavy when it's applied. It leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth not greasy and heavy. Of course having a sunscreen added directly into the product is also a huge plus. I loved this product. My friends love this product. You did well Garnier!
"I was really happy with this moisturizer. It smells good, but not overpowering. I like that it contains SPF, so I have that protection every day when I moisturize. After applying, my skin felt really fresh - not a weird texture or too greasy. I've also noticed that my acne scars are fading a lot faster since starting to use this product. Overall, my complexion looks more even and healthy."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE this moisturizer! I am prone to break-outs and was so worried about switching over from my regular moisturizer. But this goes on smooth and not oily or greasy. It left my face feeling refreshed and moisturized without feeling like I had a thick layer of gunk on my face. I've been using it for a few weeks now and can see a noticeable difference underneath my eyes and on my forehead, where I have the most lines. I have been converted over to these Garnier products!"
"I am so thankful to CrowdTap for sending me the samples of the facial moisturizer, because I really love it. I have very fair skin and get sunburn easy. I also tend to suffer from dry skin. This moisturizer felt great on my face, not greasy or irritating. I love that it did not have a strong scent because that really bothers me. Everyone who I shared these with really liked them as well, and had great things to say!"

"Garner Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is a great new product that I'm glad I found out about. I live how it has made my skin look smoother and brighter. My skin tends to look duller in the winter months but after using this new product, I've actually had friends ask what I'm doing differently and if I'm using different make-up because I look brighter and more awake. This is a great product for everyday use that I would recommend."
"I have definitely noticed a change in skin since using this product. First off my skin is softer and more hydrated. My favorite change is visibly brighter and more even skin tone. I usually have redness on my cheeks and uneven skin but not anymore. I still have dark circles under my eyes but they are less noticeable. I liked the packaging aswell, it's the perfect size to keep in my purse and reapply anywhere as needed. The fragrance is light abd fresh"
"I typically do not use moisturizer on my face, but I was excited to try Garnier Clearly Brighter Brighteningand Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. The lotion is not greasy, which is great! After a couple of weeks, the tone of my face was more even. My dark circles under my eyes lessened, as well!"

I love that it is also sunscreen which is something I often go without because it is so oily on my face but thanks to this moisturizer I will be ready for the sun this summer!
"I love this moisturizer. I've been having a hard time finding something this winter to help deal with the cold dry air with out being greasy. I love that it has SPF in it, even during the winter months. This just replaced my old moisturizer as it performed much better against the harsh winter environment."

"I normally use Neutrogena sensitive skin daily lotion. I was hesitant at first to try something new, but I was pleasantly surprised! It didn't leave my skin oily and shiny like some SPF lotions do. My skin was left soft and smooth and it worked great with my sensitive skin!! Would recommend for sure!"
"I love the way it smells, it's not so heavy with the scent, plus you can't smell the sunscreen. It's not overly greasy or oily, so soft . It moisturized my face and it kept it that way all day. In overall I love this product, it left my skin nice and smooth."
"I'll definitely liked using the Micellar Cleansing Water daily. It did the job, leaving my face clean and refreshed.

"Within days of using this product I noticed a clearer more even skin on my face. The darker spots and acne scars dissipated. Because my skin is more even, it looks brighter and younger. It's hard to find a product that really works as it states it does and this is one of them! I had 1 extra bottle from my Garnier party that I was going to give away but now I think I'll keep it. I've heard nothing but good feedback from my girlfriends who tried this product and they are very thankful that I introduced them!"

I really liked this moisturizer! It has a pleasant scent and works throughout the day. The artificial heat and cold winds of winter have been wreaking havoc on my skin- in just a couple of days this moisturizer helped my skin feel soft instead of tight!
I had totally forgotten about trying out this product. I haven't really used it long enough to give an accurate review but so far I love the scent. It makes my face feel smooth and cool.

"At first my girls and I did not realize that this was a sunscreen, but we were excited to find out that it was and that we could use it any time, not just as a moisturizer after washing our faces. After using this product a few days we noticed that our skin was soft and even while still giving it a light youthful feeling. Another thing that we liked about this product was that it did not have that ""sunscreen smell""."
I was given the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer to sample for free. First I noticed a very pleasing light scent. I have oily skin & typically when I use moisturizers my skin feels greasy & slick. This moisturizer made my skin feel silky & smooth!

"I absolutely love the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer! It is very light, goes on easy and feels great all day long - living in Florida we've had a few humid days and my skin feels fresh all day unlike with some other moisturizers. With our up and down weather this time of year, my skin is often dry and irritated easily, but the past 3 weeks of using this moisturizer my skin has been soft and smooth. I am very happy and have found a moisturizer I can finally stick with!"
"I was expecting this product to cause my skin to become oily and cause new breakouts. Instead, it cause my skin to become smooth, moisturized and feeling wonderful! I will be using this product every single day from here on out. I've been trying to find a product that won't cause my skin to become overly oily and cause new breakouts.

"I really enjoyed using Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer. It feels very lightweight on my skin and I love that it provides SPF. I have not used this product long enough yet to tell if it has improved the brightness and texture of my skin or not, but I definitely see this becoming my new daily moisturizer. I was given a sample of this product to review through CrowdTap."
I love this product. I used it after my face was clean and the first thing I noticed was the light scent. It smells kind of citrusy and it smells great! You also only need a small amount - just a little bit will go a long way. It smoothed out my skin and kept it looking great all day - I love it!I can't wait to see how my skin looks in a few months after using this consistently. I am sure it will be great!
"I received this product for free in exchange for an honest review.I received this product a few weeks ago and started using it right away. I have noticed a change in how my skin looks and feels. It is hard to explain, but my skin doesn't quite feel the same anymore. It seems more lively and clean. That is not to say my face wasn't clean before. The feeling of it being clean lasts longer than with my old routine. I am in love with this product and will be buying more in the future."
"This moisturizer just makes my skin feel good. It is a good mixture of sunscreen and a light moisturizer. It goes on easily and my makeup applies easily and evenly after I apply the moisturizer. I am a fan of Garnier products in general. And, this product is no exception. It comes in a small pump bottle that is handy to carry with me while travelling. I definitely recommend Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with SPF15."
"This is a great product! After one week I truly had visibly brighter and polished-looking skin. It's easy to apply and doesn't feel greasy. With the SPF 15, it's perfect for a person like who lives in Texas. It's always good to protect your skin.I truly recommend this product."
"I LOVE this new moisturizer. Goes on smooth and feels creamy without being greasy or lingering on my skin for too long. The scent is light but really nice. I feel like I'm doing something good for my skin when I put this moisturizer on to start out my day, and I can feel the skin being protected and moisturized through the day. GREAT PRODUCT."
"Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter Moisturizer is an absolutely wonderful product! First off it feels lightweight on your skin. It soaks in super fast leaving your skin feeling good and conditioned. It smells great, too. It leaves your skin looking bright. It's got sunscreen in it, so my skin will be protected as well. It's full of vitamins and antioxidants so I know my skin is getting revitalized. I'm crazy about this product!"
"This moisturizer-skin protector is a great product from the Garnier SkinActive line! It smells really nice, light and floral. It makes my face feel silky smooth and not oily. With a 15 spf, I feel like I'm getting two products in one. I always forget to put sunscreen on so now I will be protected better just with my daily routine!"
I loved this product because it really worked after just a few uses. I noticed that my skin was so smooth and soft and I looked more alert and awake. I had comments that my skin was glowing! I feel like ever time I use it my complexion gets better and better without having to use make up to get the desired results i'm looking for.
"I really like this product, It is light weight and easily absorbed through the skin i forgot that i even put it on. It has a nice scent to it and does smell like sunscreen but not like the regular sunscreen smell. Makes my skin feel nice i think i will be switching from my olay moisturizer to garnier :)"
I love this moisturizer. It feels good in my face and is not greasy feeling at all. It doesn't feel heavy or make my face feel tight or anything like that. If anything it makes my face feel good and it's refreshing to put on after a shower or after cleaning my face. I like that it has sunscreen in it so I know that my skin is protected.
"I only use moisturizers that have SPF in them because I can moisturizer and protect my skin from the sun using only one product. Garnier Skin Active moisturizer was a little thinner than the moisturizer I previously used, so I needed less product to cover my face. It kept my skin feeling soft and moisturized and I loved the added benefit of the SPF. The texture of the moisturizer was a little thinner-greasier (Similar to a sunscreen) than I was used to, but I just used a little less and it worked better for coverage without too much excess."

It's also good to know that this product contains Vitamins C and E and has clinically proven results. This is definitely a must-have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I absolutely loved the moisturizer. It felt great on my face, no residue, and no greasy feeling.

Working under ultraviolet lights all day wreaks havoc on the skin, this product has made our skin brighter and more healthy looking.

"I enjoyed using the garnier cleanser because it has more than one use, like cleansing the face before putting make up and for removing it. There really is no need to rub hard to remove the make up it comes off in one wipe. The Moisturizer is brightening, smoothing, refreshning and protective. The smell is pleasant to wear through out the day, long lasting."
I need my moisturizer to have spf in it and also not destroy my ultra sensitive skin... this did both! It went on smoothly without leaving that gross oily residue feeling that sometimes comes alone with moisturizers. I feel like it provided me with the coverage that I needed and left my skin feeling soft as well.
"I liked how easily the moisturizer stayed into my skin. It does not feel sticky and my skin looks moist and feels so soft.

It smelled delicious!! Will not mind applying it to my face every day. It's a lightweight cream that does not leave my skin feeling oily at all. Some moisturizers leave your face greasy and sticky. I loved that once I applied the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 my face absorbed it and left me feeling brand new!!! Gave me more confidence which gave me more energy to start my day! Love it.
"Garnier Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer has quickly become my new favorite must-have skin care accessory!

"It definitely does it's job as a moisturizer and makes my skin feel refreshed. An added bonus that I really like is that it has the low SPF for your neck and face when you use it. I have another product that I use that requires I use a skin product with SPF, so this is awesome to have. Would suggest to anyone as a daily add in to your regular skin treatment. :)"

The Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF 15 is one of the best moisturizers I ever used. It did not irritate or make my face feel greasy. After 1 1-2 weeks of use my skin felt and looked smooth and radiant. The SPF 15 protects my face against the harmful sun rays. Which can cause premature aging. I like that it contained LHA which is an exfoliant to keep my pores clear. I also feel like my skin texture has improved a lot. I cant wait to see my results after 1 months use.

"I received a full size bottle of Garner Clearly Brighter Brightening and Smoothing Daily Moisturizer to complete a review. I have used probably 10-15 other types and brands of moisturizers before in my long journey of good skin care products. I was impressed after my first application of this product . It did not leave a residue on my face, did not feel like I had any sort of product on my face. My face felt smooth and clean all day- and the oil was definitely decreased after a couple of days. I am a believer! Thank you!"
"I liked how soft and bright it made my skin look just after a few days of using this product, and I also liked that it had a very light scent to it as well. I liked how quickly it absorbed in to my skin. Oh and I thought that was great that it comes out of a pump."
"The Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter moisturizer was a great multi-purpose product. Moisturizing, brightening, smoothing, AND a sunscreen, all in one product! It smelled great, and went on feeling soft and smooth--not greasy. We are excited to watch the long-term benefits of the lotion, and look forward to telling our friends and family!"
"I loved the Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15! After I wash my face, it's so dry and feels tight. After I apply my Garnier moisturizer, it's smooth, soft, and smells great. It's easy to apply and very lightweight. I hated that my previous moisturizer always felt so heavy on my face. Love Garnier and their new skin products!"
"I really like Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. The lotion is easy to apply and has a nice fresh scent.

I highly recommend it!"
"This is the best moisturizer with SPF that I have tried! Not only is the product very lightweight but it makes my skin smooth and radiant. I literally felt like I was wearing nothing at all. Plus, my skin looks smoother and brighter after each use. This product is a keeper!!"
I had never tried any type of moisturizer on my face because I thought they were all heavy and noticeable. The first time I use Garnier Clearly Brightener Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer I was hooked!

It has the properties to protect your skin and moisturize to keep it healthy as well as having sun protection and the extra bonus of making your skin glow and look so much healthier.It is light and doesn't gunk up your pores and it makes my skin feel fresh and light. Now when I don't wear make up, my skin looks great and bright versus with my other moisturizer."
"Garnier Daily Mosturizer with sunscreen is great. Living in Florida, I should use a sunscreen daily but if it's not combined in a product I use daily I might forget to use any. However Garnier's Moisturizer with SPF 15 is perfect for me since I do daily use a moisturizer. I like the feel of this moisturizer on my face. My face felt very smooth and soft after using this. It just feels so great. I have enjoyed using this and am glad I had the chance to try it."

Normally I am pretty skeptical when It comes to facial products for my face because they don't normally work well. I do have to say though I am very impressed and very happy with the results of this product. I normally have pretty oily and yucky skin and I can't believe how great my face feels and looks after just a few days of using this.
I have been loyal to my daily moisturizer for years- but I honestly am going to switch and give it a real go! I loved the fresh scent and the way that my face felt so incredibly smooth with no build up. It was completely non greasy while still hydrating my face at the same time. The next day my face still felt smooth so I can only imagine what a weeks worth of use will do! I really feel like this will be my new face lotion. Plus- an added bonus is that it has sunscreen built in which I really need!

I love products that already have SPF in them - It makes it simple and easy to actually wear some sunscreen protection! The scent is very light, and lovely. The product itself goes on nice and smooth. I've been using it for about a week or more, and have definitely noticed my skin looking brighter! Which is great because in this cold Michigan weather, I needed some brightening!"
"This moisturizer is exactly what I was needing! It is so hard to find a gently facial moisturizer that doesn't leave me feeling greasy. However, Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer did the the trick! It is also amazing that it has SPF 15, which means I don't have to put on a separate sunscreen. Wonderful product!"
"I really like this moisturizer! I do not need a lot to leave my skin feeling soft, smooth and hydrated. Leaves my skin feeling soft! I not only use it in the morning before my makeup, but in the evening after cleansing my face for a fresh soft feel all day, and all night long."
Garnier skin active brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer one of the things I really like about the product that it makes my skin look a lot more smooth and a lot more even . I also like that it pretty much makes it so you can't hardly see the wrinkles on my face. This product I would recommend.
I genuinely enjoy this product and so did all my friends! Most of my friends noted on the scent and how it smelled nice and we all acknowledged that the moisturizer did do a well job and keeping our skin hydrated. It wasn't harsh and it did not feel oily on the skin. It was very smooth and hydrating.
I am in love with moisturizer! not only does it smell wonderful like citrus but it goes on my skin easily and smoothly and keeps my skin soft all day! it's non greasy which is also a plus because I have oily skin and I can use this and not look greasy!
"This product is revolutionary for my skin care regemin. These products hydrate my face as well as remove dirt makeup and oil after a long day at work and the gym. These products were gentle enough to leave my skin feeling rejuvenated and not cause irritation, redness or rashes."
"My friends and I were really impressed by this moisturizer. It feels really light, like you're not wearing anything at all. Usually there's this heaviness to moisturizers, especially ones with SPF in them. There is a smell when you're putting it on, but it fades away afterwards. It's not enough to bother me, as I'm sensitive to strong smells. Overall, my friends and I enjoy this moisturizer and will probably keep it in mind when we're out shopping."
"Love the light feel of this moisturizer. It leaves my skin feeling very fresh and it is so light, no oily heavy feeling under my makeup. I highly recommend it if you are looking for a light feeling moisturizer that has an SPF and is great under your make up."
We all loved this product It don't have a smell but it works awesome on moisturizing your face. We washed our face with the Micellar cleasing water then applied the moisturizer. It hydrated my skin what I really love about it is it has SPF15. This is a great product and I don't think I will ever go back to using plain old lotion for my face again.. It don't dry your face out like most products your face feels hydrated all day..
"This moisturizer is amazing! It makes my face feel amazing! I have been using it for a few days and I am already loving it. The scent is not my favorite but I can look past that because it works very very well with my oily skin! I will definitely recommend this. It is a great quality product, I am already in love!

This is my new favorite Moisturizer. I have been using it a week and I have noticed that my skin is not as dry and is it smoother just like it says. It only takes a little bit & it goes a long way. No smell(that I noticed). Super creamy. My mom also uses it since she has very dry skin and she has seen a very big difference. I highly recommend it. I also live that it has SPF in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Very moisturizing, and it doesn't leave an ashen/white cast on my skin unlike a lot of moisturizers where the main ingredient is sunscreen. Not really sure what the ""clearly brighter brightening"" bit is referring to since it states on the box that it is just a sunscreen and is best used with their overnight peel from the same line.

I really liked the smell. It smells really pleasant instead of that sunblock smell that spf often brings. I like that the it wasn't too sticky when applied to my skin and made it feel much nice. It really helps with the winter dry skin I have which I really like about the product. I would use it often. It is amazing.
"I love this!! I have been using it for about a week, and I have seen definite improvements in the brightness of my skin!! I love that it has SPF, so I always feel protected when I wear it. It isn't greasy, and I apply it before my makeup every morning!"
I use a facial moisturizer daily so when I heard about this new product from Garnier I just couldn't wait to try it. I really like how light it is yet still very hydrating. I also love that it is a multipurpose moisturizer because it also improves skin texture and makes your skin tone more even. I love a product that' scan all in one and it really works. My skin tone is more even and much smoother than before. I received the Garnier Clearly Brighter & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 for free inn exchange of my honest review.
"The packaging is very bright and inviting. When you pump out the white liquid, it is a consistency of sunscreen. The smell is pleasant and it goes on smooth. Moisturizer blends nicely on your skin and does not leave it feeling greasy. My skin felt clean and refreshed after using. I would recommend this moisturizer."
The garnier skinactive water is amazing took off all eye makeup very quickly no makeup was left !The garnier skinactive clearly brighter with spf made my face smooth and moisturized made my face brighter feeling soft and feft like I didn't even put an spf on like it usually makes your skin feel ! Overall I feel these products work and I would recommend them to anyone !
"If I know this Garnier Clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer SPF15 early, I will not suffer breakout which I used another brand before. This is great SPF moisturizer not only protect your skin but not greasy and last quite well. Overall I am very satisfied with this product."
Garnier SkinActivr Micellar Cleansing water is a bottle of amazement. Not only is it gentle enough to take off my daughters make up it also causes no redness or break outs.The best part about it is there is no need to rinse this off just use a cotton pad wipe and done!As far as the clearly brighter with Spf my fave looks smoother and its also evening out my skintone. I love it.

Overall I was happy with the Moisturizer because it left my face feeling soft and moisturized. It's not overly oily and it lasted for a long time. But it is a little thick and made my skin feel sticky after a while. I like that this has a spf 15 in it because it's easier to find and use a daily moisturizer with an spf already in it than it is to apply 2 different products. Overall it's a nice moisturizer but I've tried others that were better so I probably won't be purchasing this after the bottle is gone.

"Clearly brighter combined with the ire products have my party planning on purchasing more after using it for six days skin is brighter firmer, and skin blotches all but gone.

I received this product through crowdtap. It is very light with a summery fragrance. It absorbed into my face quickly and did not leave behind a greasy feeling. My skin does feel smooth but I cannot speak to the brightening effect yet because I have only used it for a few days...which is why I didn't give it five stars. Jury is out yet on that. I also used it on the top of my hands.
"This product is fantastic. Not only is it a great moisturizer but it also has the added benefit of sun protection with the SPF15. The added spf is important to me because you do not have to use another product. So the moisturizer has an extra benefit, it saves me from having to buy and use another pro ducts.

"Love it I have been using this for several days now and with my sensitive, dry skin, I can honestly say that this makes a difference. There is a light, pleasant fragence which hasn't bothered me. It soaks in rather quickly, which for a moisturizer with sunscreen is a first for me. Most combination products seem to sit on my skin for at least 10 minutes before even beginning to soak in.

Even my acne is healing up and going away which I tried so many products to help with my acne but until I tried Garnier it seemed hopeless. I would recommend anyone to at least try this product because it is more than worth it. True results in no time flat.
Very Impressed with this Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. Feels like a product that I could use daily and not be doing too much to my skin!! SPF is super important but so is MOISTURE! ! Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer is lightweight and leaves you feeling smooth!! I will definitely be buying this product!!
"I used to use Clean and Clear moisturizer with SPF, but always found that it made my skin greasy and way too shiny. I tried my sample of Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 and was absolutely amazed how great it felt on my skin. My skin was softer and felt rejuvenated. It moisturized my skin so well and did not leave a greasy feeling at all. I am super impressed and definitely will continue to buy this product and other products from Garnier!"
"Garnier Clearly Brighter and Smoothing Daily Mosturizer SPF15 works amazing well at keeping my skin fresh and soft. I apply it in the morning before makeup and wear it throughout my day to protect my skin from the sun's harmful rays. Moisturizer is very important to wear always to keep a youthful appearance, especially one that is also SPF15. This product doesn't leave my skin greasy or cause breakouts like many other moisturizers. It's light and smells amazing."
"Enjoyable moisturizer. Its not too thick and is easy to apply. It left my skin smooth without leaving it oily. The smell was alright, it was fresh but didn't have a super strong scent.

Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15 works well. It soaks into the skin quickly and does not leave it feeling oily or greasy. Does have a slight sweet smell that I could do without. Nice that it has sunscreen in the product.
The Garnier Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer with spf15 made my face feel really soft. I loved that it did not make my face feel greasy in fact once I rubbed it in I couldn't even tell it was on my face except for the face that my skin felt super smooth and soft. My husband mentioned that my skin seemed brighter too so that is always a plus.
I was never a fan of Garnier skin care however getting the chance to try these items have changed my mind about them. The moisturizer was a perfect match for the Micellar Cleansing Water. After cleansing I applied the moisturizer. Not greasy and felt great on my skin. My party participants enjoyed it as well

So not only does it hydrate your skin, it also helps protect you from the harmful sun rays. I will definitely be buying more of this when I run out. It is now part of my daily routine."
"I really enjoyed the Clearly Brighter Brightening & Smoothing Daily Moisturizer SPF15. It was really gentle on my sensitive skin, there was hardly any SPF smell or harsh fragrance. Also, there wasn't any oil or mineral oil, and it seems that there is some salicylic acid in it which is great too. The white water lily smell is much more pleasant that the SPF smell. The only reason why this won't get a five star rating is that I can't determine if my skin looks better after one full week of use."

"I was surprised that this product did seem to brighten my dull, winter complexion. it would be great if it could even tackle those pesky age/sun spots as well. It goes on easy and absorbs quickly with a tighten effect as it dries. The product is not expensive so there really isn't any reason not to giving it a try. I'm guessing that it might work better for women like me in their 30's or 40's who are mostly dealing with sun damage [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

In my opinion all the Garnier products are great. The Garnier clearly brighter brightening & smoothing daily moisturizer spf15 is really great. I love the way it smell which is great and it makes my skin feels so soft and bright. My friends also likes them too and they decided to buy more of them
Very light and creamy to the touch. After application your face feels very fresh and clean not weighted down and greasy. As you apply the daily moisturizer you are greeted with a very fresh and light scent. It's not overwhelming and it didn't sting my eyes at all. The ladies in my party were delighted to feel refreshed and smooth to the touch. One of my lady friends is the mommy of a toddler and was surprised to see how quickly the routine would be for her. I was thrilled with the product and plan to stick with it.
This face cream gives my skin a nice glow. I would definitely recommend.

For a moisturizer to be useful with an SPF it should be at least 30. So I would just use this as a moisturizer and use an additional SPF. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
