First tried this cream yesterday. Already see a difference. Skin is radiant and looks smooth and bright! Don't change a thing! Ill use this as a night cream as well.
"I have hypersensitive skin, and this works for me! I prefer unscented (which this is not), but I don't smell it after a couple of minutes, so it is not an issue for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturiser does Not irritate my sensitive skin Nor clog my blemish prone skin. It absorbs quickly, spreads nicely and does Not have a white caste. I though I'd end up returning it due to the fragrance, but the scent is mild and pleasant to me. I have been using it 1 wk and already notice my acne blemishes are lighter and not as pigmented as they were before. My skin looks smoother too. I recommended this to all my friends and family."
"I have been using Clearly Brighter for two weeks now and I love it! I can see a difference in my skin. It does look brighter and my sun/age spots are softening. I love the non greasy feel to it and am so thankful that it has SPF 30. After buying products that cost 4 times this price, I am sold!"
"I have purchased everything from Neiman Marcus' best serums to cocoa butter. This moisturizer goes on beautifully, has a fresh light scent and protects all day. My BB cream glides over it effortlessly and actually makes it look even better. My skin is brighter and glows like it did 20 years ago! I am obsessed with this moisturizer!!"
I work outside all day in extreme heat and sun. I have tried many moisturizers with sun protection including some very high end expensive brands. This truly is my favorite. Goes on nice not greasy. My skin loves it. I am over 50 and have sensitive skin. I just purchased some more to take to work with me so I can re-apply mid day... I love love this product!!
"I bought this moisturizer a week ago and have already noticed improvements with my skin. My face feels soft, smells good, and the color of my skin feels so much brighter. I have been using the same Clean and Clear Moisturizer for the past few years, but now after trying this product I am never switching back!"
I usually only buy higher-priced facial SPFs. I got a sample of this and LOVE it. It hydrates my 50-yr.-old skin all day & leaves a beautiful finish for makeup. No parabens. I will definitely buy this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product. Sun damage catches up with you, especially after age 60. I've used this product about 2 years & it did remove a large dark spot I had on my cheek. It took months but my perseverence paid off. Remember to use sunscreen every day....this helps prevent any new dark spots."
"as part of my skincare routine to reduce facial redness, this moisturizer works very well. it includes SPF 30 and is less heavy than applying sunscreen. on it's own, i do not believe it would be an effective treatment for redness/brightening. i only recommend this to those who are looking for sun protection in a moisturizer."
"Great product! Smells good. And, most importantly, besides the SPF it has made a noticeable difference with brown spots!"
This is not the old light weight spf 15. Like a few other reviewers said this will cause breakouts. It took a few weeks of me using this to realize it was this causing pimples and puss filled bumps all over my face. Now I have acne scars. After throwing this away my face has cleared up 4 days later. Thanks for ruining my skin. Ladies use an oil free spf for sensitive skin. This product is not it.
Such a good product. Wonder why I can only find it on-line?
Great SPF prevents brown spots on my face from sun damage
"Works great, non greasy and feels great on."
Like all Garnier products this makes my skin feel magnificent and look horribly greasy. It is highly scented but I like the smell. It absorbs nicely and my skin feels hydrated and soft. The LHA doesn't tingle or burn but it's sure working because I haven't had to exfoliate once since I started using this and I used to manually exfoliate twice a week! The benefits outweigh the drawbacks and the price is great for the effects I'm getting so I cover the shine with rice powder and shrug it off.
"I've been using this lotion for a few weeks and I really love it. It goes on very smooth and smells fresh. It does a good job of moisturizing my skin (which is too dry for many face lotions), but soaks in quickly and doesn't leave any greasiness at all. Great lotion!"
I tried it months back. I have sensitive skin and it didn't irritate my skin. It isn't too greasy on my skin.
"The old version was great, used it for years but now homosalate was added and it has caused my skin to breakout. Time to find something new."
I recd one that had an experation date of 1-2018 in Feb. 2018. I returned to the store and was given a gift card.
I've been using this moisturizer for almost 10 years now. I'm in my 60s and have very few lines on my face.
I have been using this for years. I am 71 and the skin on my face looks years younger. I just bought it for my granddaughters to start them on a good skincare regimen.
"Tried alot of different products because I like a variety, read some reviews on the web and thought I would give it a try. I am so glad I did, I can tell it is working as I have a small area of discoloration (sometimes my hair stylist thinks it's hair color and tries to wipe it away!) it has definitely lightened this area up, as well as very slight redness on my cheeks I was noticing. As far as any other notable changes, I imagine it's making improvements!"
The first few days of using this product was amazing. My skin looked good and I felt confident but a week later my face looked like it was falling off. it was dry and flakey and nothing could be done to make it better. I have stopped using the product and probably will only use it if I am really desperate.
I was looking for a moisturizer to use daily during the winter and this is exactly what I needed! I have experienced adverse reactions from other products but Garnier Clearly Brighter has been great - I use it every morning! Would absolutely recommend!
I'm not certain if this product is sunscreen or if it's a moisturizer? It comes out like a sunscreen but on the box it shows it as a moisturizer but with sunscreen in it I guess? I'm not quite sure very confused help?
LOVE...LOVE....LOVE... as I have stated before I spend alot of time gardening and I am in the sun alot so this is a really good product....it's not greasy at all and it is very lightweight!
This product is the best. My sister in law recommended this to me because I had noticeable sin spots on my face. This has definitely lightened them dramatically. It is great as a sunscreen as well. I use it daily. My complexion is lookin better and better everyday. Thank you Garnier
"I really enjoyed my chance to try Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer from Garnier. It has truly changed the way I apply my moisturizer. Everyday when I leave the house, I am confident in the fact that the spf is going to help me to prevent any further damage to my face. I am a red head and I cannot tell you what a concern it is to me that the sun is going to damage my skin. I no longer have to worry about that with this product. I am very satisfied with the product and I am so glad I got to try it."
I replaced my current non SPF with the Garnier SkinActive Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF 30. Especially now that we are getting closer to summer and participating in outdoor activities it's important to have SPF protection. This moisturizer is thicker and a little heavier then my previous product. I was apprehensive at first because I like a lighter weightless moisturizer. However it quickly absorbed and I didn't even notice it. I was also happy to have the added SPF protection.
I really like this moisturizer. I have the driest skin ever and this really makes my skin feel hydrated without a lot of oil or shininess. I love how light and fresh this smells and how cute the bottle is. It also seems to be made with very simple ingredients which is awesome for my skin and being pregnant because I'm really careful about what products I use. My only improvement is that I feel like you really have to rub it in because it is like the consistency of sunscreen.
The Garnier Moisturizer SPF30 feels light on the skin and provides the protection I need in the sun without the heavy feeling and doesn't clog pores. I like that it is lightly scented and the pump makes the product easy to dispense and more sanitary. I recommend this for daily use.
"I love the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer. It has made my skin look brighter and makes me look more awake. I love the way my skin feels right after I put it on, moisturized but not weighed down. The scent is also very pleasant."
"While I like using the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF 30, the scent was a little overbearing for me. I prefer a scentless moisturizer. My skin felt soft and adequately moisture throughout the day. It was easy and effortless to apply without feeling greasy. My makeup was easily applied on top of it."
"I've been using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 for a couple weeks and I'm really satisfied with the results. I like the consistency of it, I like that it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy and moisturizes it really well. The smell of the product is very pleasant. It works great under makeup. My skin feels smooth and looks brighter. I also love that it protects my skin from the sun!"
The Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 worked very well for me. It helped to moisturize my skin while giving me a glow that was beautiful. I did not like how strongly scented to moisturizer was. Several times i noticed that i got a headache from the moisturizer.
I absolutely adore these products garnier has always been one of my favorite on a majority of their products they never disappoint and with this product is no different I can't wait to see the long-term effects from using these products thanks Garnier
"Going into summer, I put away all the heavy night creams and balms, and trade in the spf15 for an spf30. The Clearly Brighter Daily Moisturizer fit that bill perfectly, even in terms of scent which was pleasant but light. It has a nice, silky texture after it dries down and doesn't have that dreaded white cast. The only concern I have is how well it plays with some of my foundations (but I don't really like to wear that in the summer anyway!)"
"I spend way to much time outside and am not always diligent with SPF. This product made it simple and easy by containing a SPF. It went out smoothly, Brightened my skin and it wasn't too fragrant. Its also really affordable. This post was sponsored by Garnier SkinActive as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review.”"
I really liked the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 that I had the opportunity to try. I liked the fact that it didn't feel heavy on my face after going on and even made my foundation go on more smoothly. I also liked the fact that it is SPF30 as I want to protect my face from sun damage.I love that this product comes from a brand I trust and is easy to find at local stores.
"I received a sample of the Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer from Crowdtap, and have been using it for a couple of weeks now. I am definitely seeing results, as there is a HUGE difference in the dark spots on my cheeks and forehead. I was skeptical at first, but within about ten days, I started seeing changes. Things can only continue to improve! The moisturizer is a little bit thick and it blends in well without using an oily finish, and it has a pleasant fragrance. All in all, a very good product."
"This just might be the best moisturizer I have ever used. I like a product that takes care of more then just moisturizing, I live in South Florida and sunscreen is a must - this takes care of that. This is non greasy and absorbs nicely. This is a must have for anyone."
"I've been using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 for a few weeks now, and I just love it! It's not sticky or thick. It's really smooth and feels great on my skin! It allows my skin to breathe and dries really fast!"
Garnier's SkinActive Clearly Brighter moisturizer has been a soy wonderful to use. My skin is very sensitive and this moisturizer has helped with my dry areas without being so heavy as to make me break out more. I couldn't be more pleased with this product!
"I try to use this moisturizer on my face any time I leave the house, usually under makeup. It feels weightless and I love that it absorbs quickly. Also smells good. It seems to be working so far. This post was sponsored by Garnier SkinActive as part of a sampling activation for Crowdtap. I received complimentary products to facilitate my review."
"I've tried other products like this one that seemed to maybe moisturize a bit better, but this one was okay. It seemed to protect my face from the sun, but I wasn't sure if this was something I should apply to other places as well. It absorbed into my skin quickly and was easy to apply, didn't leave my face feeling greasy. I did notice that the box said to apply every two hours but I thought that was a bit strange since it would mess up my make up if I was wearing any."
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 is a super effective daily moisturizer. It is non oily and smells great. It makes my skin look healthy and softs in addition to protecting it against the sun. Highly recommended.
I received the Garnier skinactive clearly brighter anti-sun damage daily moisturizer for free to provide my honest opinion. I love it! It is lightweight. Works well under my makeup and provide great protection to my skin from sun damage. It has a nice smell and is suitable for sensitive skin. I would definitely recommend it.
"I love the Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Moisturizer with SPF 30! It's non-greasy, smells great with its fruity fresh scent, and moisturizes my skin really well! It is very easy to apply, spreads easily and evenly, without any residue left behind. Doesn't clog pores. It provides superior protection against dangerous UV rays and their damage it does to skin, thanks to its SPF 30."
This sunscreen is a very lite weight cream and offers great protection. It doesnt leave my skin oily or skicky and it fully absorbs into my skin without leavibg that white color like most sunscreens leave. It smells great and is very enjoyable to use.
Great product with a wonderful scent. Lightweight and effective. Helps my skin feel more supple while protecting it from the harmful rays of the sun. I am so addicted to this product!! I can't wait to put it on each morning and night and the scent stays with me through the day.
"I love that this product has a higher SPF and moisturizer. I have been using for a couple of weeks and I didn't have any reaction or any pimples so I believe it works with my combination skin. The only thing I would change it's the way it smells, just like a sunscreen , I would prefer something with a milder fragrance."
"Definitely gave me great protection from the sun. I loved that the product was lightweight, I could wear it under my makeup with ease. The smell wasn't unpleasant, it had a nice feel to it and was easy to spread. My skin definitely looks and feels healthier."
"I love the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30. The lightly scented moisturizer absorbs easily, is not oily, and minimized the appearance of a dark spot on my forehead from sun damage after using for a little over a week. My makeup went on smoothly after using the moisturizer and my skin looked brighter and more even toned."
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 not only protects my skin it also leaves it feeling nourished and complete. Other moisturizers I have used always left my skin with a residue feeling after application but with Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 it's so light weight and goes on so smooth that it feels like a refreshing new start.
Garnier's SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 has become an important part of my morning skin care routine. Before trying this I wasn't using an SPF or a moisturizer on my face. Now I remember to protect and nourish my skin every morning. This SPF moisturizer is not oily or cakey and it has a very great floral scent. It's not thick like a normal suncreen so it's great to apply daily. I would recommend this proud to friends and family!
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 is the best moisturizer I have ever tried! It doesn't leave a greasy feel on my face and it feels very light weight unlike other moisturizers with spf I have tried. I will definitely continue to use it.
"I love this product! I have oily skin and I usually have breakouts when I use cream based sunblock, but with Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30, i don't. It is also effective in protecting my face when I went for a swim. The scent is also not strong and irritating."
"Garner SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 is a great way to protect your skin from the sun. I love that you can use it under makeup and it doesn't leave a greasy feeling on your skin. It is not to thick where it leaves white strikes, it is the perfect sun protection for your face."
This is a good daily moisturizer with SPF. The product gave my skin just the right amount of moisture with leaving it feeling stinky or oily as I sometimes expect an SPF moisturizer to do. The SPF 30 is just the right amount for daily wear. I also enjoy the small packaging with a pump. It is perfect to throw in a handbag and use on the go.
"Garnier's SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 is a great, reasonably priced sunscreen that smells good and doesn't feel sticky like classic sunscreen. I've been using this as a daily protection for my neck-as I already have a daily SPF50 that I love for my face-and I've been enjoying it. No one wants a daily SPF when they smell like sunscreen. This one eliminates that issue and leaves skin feeling soft and moisturized."
"I like that there is not much fragrance to it. Thick and creamy to the touch. Goes not evenly. Hands do not feel oily after applying. Leaves skin soft. No irritations. No sun burns for being in the sun for over 2 hours. What I dislike about is that after being on face for a period of time, my skin does get oily. I did not see any changes in my sun spots after using it for 2 weeks."
"Awesome daily moisturizer! This may not be enough during the dry winters, but it's great for Spring and Summer! I use this daily and noticed a change in my skin after 1 week of consistent use. I use 2 pumps every day for my face and 1 pump for my neck. It's light, soaks in fast, and has a slight scent. Recommended to all my friends!"
"The smell is absolutely divine! It smells so clean and fresh! I also love the bright green packaging which helps set the tone for a clean feeling experience. The moisturizer feels absolutely great and helps my rough, dry patches. I'm thoroughly impressed with the quality and price of this moisturizer."
This moisturizer is great! It leaves my skin soft and supple looking without having a greasy feeling. It feels light even under my makeup and I love it gives that extra sun protection. The only draw back I feel this moisturizer is it has to be reapplied every 2 hours if this is the only product that I am wearing for sun protection.
"I enjoyed my sample of Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30, it left my skin looking more youthful, it was brighter with less spotting. It had a nice citrus scent that did not irritate my face. This moisturizer is not sticky or oily it left my skin feeling very smooth."
"Received a free sample of Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30. I like how light it is and how quickly it absorbs. SPF 30 is great; strong enough to protect my fair skin. I don't really like the smell, though, and it leaves mys kin looking a little too oily."
"I love all of the Garnier SkinActive products. It has helped my complexion tremendously. It goes on smoothly, absorbs quickly and is light weight, not heavy and doesn't make my skin feel greasy. I use it daily. I have even started putting some on my hands, same results. I am so happy I was able to try this product and be able to let everyone know just how great it is."
I loved this product. It felt amazing on my skin. There was no oily residue and it absorbed nicely into my skin. I used this once a day (sometimes twice when I remembered) but the difference in my skin was noticable in about a week of using it daily. My skin was clearer and softer to the touch. I also did see a brightness to my skin. I have plan to use this lotion for a long long time.
"I really did not like the Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30, it left my skin oily and caused acne breakouts. It was just like applying regular sunscreen not moisturizer in any way. I tried just applying this for days when I was outside for just a little bit of time doing some yard work and I still came inside to find that I had red (sunburn) on my face, I had to apply aloe so that I didn't burn to much. I think this product has way to much oil in it, and that is what caused my face to burn easier than it normally does, I even have dry skin."
"I love the idea; however something about it made me break out like crazy and I needed to stop using it. By the second and third day of using it, I've had the worst breakouts I've had in years. Once I stopped using it, my breakouts have started to clear up. I love the idea that it helps your skin look better and has SPF 30 though."
I like that it keeps my skin feeling soft and moisturized.The clearly bright soaks into my skin really fast and I've notice within weeks of using this product my dark spots are fading. It is easy to use the Clearly Brighter Anti-Skin Damage Daily Mositurizer Spf30 soaks into my skin really fast. It is an added bonus for the skin to have the SPF30 in it.
I loved this moisturizer. It went on so smoothly and it only took a little t o cover my entire face. It didn't take much to leave my skin feeling silky smooth and it absorbed quickly. Usually sunscreen leaves a sticky feeling but not this one. I could hardly tell that I had applied anything at all. I love that it has an SPF of 30. It makes me feel great that my skin is going to be moisturized and safe from the sun this summer!
"I've been using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 for a couple weeks now, and I haven't found anything bad to say about it! It moisturizes really well (no dry patches—woohoo!) and it doesn't leave my skin oily or greasy (no sudden breakouts—yay!). Although I was a bit skeptical about it actually brightening my skin, I do have to say my face has been sporting a healthy glow as of late. It doesn't hurt that the product smells really nice and applies evenly too!"
"A bit more of a sunscreen feel, than a moisturizer. It wasn't sticky, but, I may just be using too much. I do not care to use both the dark spot corrector with the Clearly Brighter moisturizer at the same time. I do like this moisturizer by itself, but will have to get used to applying it."
"I have really enjoyed incorporating Garnier's Clearly Brighter products into my routine. In the morning the Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF 30 leaves my skin feeling protected and healthy. It isn't too heavy on my face, and it doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky. It's actually really refreshing. It makes me feel like I'm ready to conquer the day."
so far i like how easy it is to use every morning. it is light weight and non greasy which is very nice to have in a moisturizer. Ive seen so improvement so far and im going to keep using it to see how much more improvement my skin gets. I also really like that it has the spf 30 in there so i feel good about wearing it and going out.
"I absolutely loved the clearly brighter anti -sun damage daily moisturizer with SPF30. My face was kept moisturized and felt smoother ,softer and younger looking. My skin also looked all around healthier and brighter. It also kept my face from getting sunburnt while I was on vacation and I spent two full days outside in the hot sun! I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a good anti aging product who also wants a mositureizer and sun protection as well."
"Estos productos han cambiado mi vida y mi rostro, mi piel se siente mas suave, mas hidratada las lineas han disminuido notablemente y las manchas tambien. Seguire utilizando esta linea de productos y esa rutina para que mi piel siga mejor. Le hable a todos sobre este producto y todos han notado el cambio, me enanta."
"Absolutely my most favorite moisturizer. I love that it has SPF 30, doesn't smell like sunscreen, and absorbs so quickly and leavesy fave feeling super soft and hydrated. After using this for a couple weeks, I have noticed great improvement on my face. Would highly recommend."
I like this moisturizer. It provides excellent sun protection without feeling like a typical sunscreen. It's a non-greasy formula that absorbs nicely in on the skin. I even see some improvement in my nose which had some redness for years after getting sunburned.
"What I liked about this moisturizer is the SPF. It really does what it says! I had to sit for hours at a graduation last weekend and I put Anti-Sun Daily Moisturizer SPF30 before I left, not only on my face, but on my neck and chest. By end of graduation, everyone was face and chest was red and I looked like I had a hat and scarf on all day. No sunburn, no redness at all. Aside the fact, that it made my skin smooth as well....I was impressed."
"Love the light formula. Soaks in fast, to make makeup application easier. Makes applying spf on a daily basis a cinch. This moisturizer, along with the garnier peel, has helped lighten some of my most stuborn spots. I only have mildly sensitive skin, the light fragrance did not irritate it."
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer with SPF30 is an awesome everyday moisturizer. I apply it daily before heading outside and am fully protected from the suns harmful rays. Garnier leaves my skin fully moisturized while improving the skins appearance. Would recommend!
"Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun damage daily moisturizer has been working just great on my face. Not only have I noticed dark spots on my face diminishing my skin feels more smooth and firm. I really love the feel of this moisturizer, it is not too thick and very cooling when applying on my face. Some sunscreen moisturizers tend to feel heavy on my skin but not Garnier, this is perfect to wear everyday as it is very light and moisturizing and gives you that sunscreen protection."
I recieved #garnier skinactive clearly brighter products from @crowdtap to try and review and i have to say im not impressed. The smell is awesome but it left my face oily and i dont see or feel any difference in my skin. All and all im not satisfied with the product
I'm really enjoying the Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer. I really like the packaging as I am forever losing bottle caps! The product goes on smooth without that SPF smell usually associated with SPF lotions. I like how gentle this is on my extremely sensitive skin.
"I have noticed a dramatic change in the way my,skin looks and feels. I have already got compliments on looking,younger. I,love these products and will definitely continue to use them. I never knew garnier skin products worked so well. Way better than the department store ones I have tried."
"One of the best drugstore moisturizers I have ever tried. A little bit goes a long way, it absorbs nicely into the skin (and I have oily skin). It doesn't leave a shine behind if you apply your foundation over top of it. It smells wonderful and feels lightweight. I also love the fact that it is infused with Vitamin C and LHA. It has brightened my skin and has made my skin feel softer and smoother in just a few weeks."
"I am outside a lot with my children so I need a moisturizer that has some SPF protection. Being fair skinned, I need a moisturizer with a higher SPF. Garnier Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer with SPF30 is the answer to my needs. It's a brand I trust and the SPF that I need without a heavy, slimy feeling on my face."
"This moisturizer is great! I usually don't use moisturizer with SPF, I know I should, and I really enjoyed the SPF protection. This moisturizer is light, great for summer, and it smells wonderful! I do need more powder through the day though. And also after I put make-up on the moisturizer starts to be crumbly."
"Normally, lighter-weight moisturizers don't cut it for me; I'll either apply one time and have to go for round two, or I'll end up using double the amount and STILL feel parched.What I love about this moisturizer is that it's lightweight BUT moisturizing enough to keep my skin from needing more. The built-in SPF is a super-bonus, too, and I've definitely seen a noticeable improvement in my skin's brightness-clarity (ie, no breakouts!) since I've been using this consistently over three weeks."
This is a great moisturizer the SPF you get isn't bad. Its light enough that you can wear it alone or before you put on make up. I was able to try it for free thanks to crowdtap and Garnier. I would say the smell might not be for everyone. It has a light citrus fragrance so if you don't like that then it might not be for you. Its a decent size and its great I have found a little goes a long way with this product. If you are worried about breakouts I have sensitive skin and it didn't affect or cause break outs. Not greasy which I like.
"I really do like Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30. I have been using it for a little over a week and each day have been out in the sun on walks for over two hours. I haven't been putting suntan lotion on my arms, so those got burnt, but my face hasn't gotten burnt at all! It hydrates my face without leaving it super oily and it works wonderfully as an SPF! I received this product for free to try from Crowdtap and Garnier, all opinions are my own-and I really do like it!"
Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF 30 has become apart of my morning routine. I apply the product daily before I put my make up on and head out to work. My skin has been soft. The product gives me peace of mind that it can protect my skin with the SPF 30. It is a very light formula and smells great.
"I've been wanting to find a daily moisturizer that actually works. And now...I found it!!! I have a weird dry spot on my face, and thanks to this, it's pretty much gone. In about a weeks time my face is softer. It doesn't make me break out. I don't need a lot when I use it. I love it!"
No more am I afraid of the sun or sun damage. This goes on very smooth without any stickiness. Makes my face more confident and radiant. Ingredients are all natural with the added kick of sun protection which I love. Facial scars and dryness are now almost gone and I dont have to wear so much makeup to cover it.
"I love that this is a moisturizer that has antioxidants and vitamins. With using it's fast absorbing, non-greasy formula in just one week it has helped reduce the look of visible sun damage, dark spots, fine lines and wrinkles, revealing My skin to be radiant, more even-toned, and younger looking!"
"The small is very pleasant & is very light. It does not leave a heavy, thick or sticky feeling like certain moisturizer with spf does. I love that my skin gets moisturized, protected from the sun & smells great all together. I haven't tried long enough to see the results of my skin but the spf works so far, I haven't gotten any sun damage which is a plus in my book!"
"I received free Garnier Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 for testing purposes. I don't like heavy Moisturizer because I have combination skin. This Moisturizer is light weight and I liked it. I have some dark spots, Against the sun I put it on my face before the make ups. I was worried about my make ups won't stay long but it did. The smell of lotion is soft and good. I will recommend it to my friends."
"I love Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF 30. My skin is well hydrated with the needed SPF protection. I haven't felt overly oily as with some moisturizers. It doesn't feel ""tacky"" like some other moisturizers with SPF. Definitely would recommend this product to friends and family."
"I love the fact that it keeps my face, neck, and chest moisturized. It smells great and is not heavy nor greasy. It gives me protection from the sun too. I have very sensitive skin and it doesn't even irritate it. I received this product for free to provide a review on Crowdtap."
I have been using Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Famage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 for about two weeks. I really like this moisturizer. It smells good and keeps my face moist and soft all day. I like that it doesn't smell like sunscreen and I don't have to worry about reapplying half way through the day. I wear makeup and primers over top and its just like my other moisturizers. I normally use high end products but I like this one just as much. I think it's a great product and I would absolutely buy it.
"I love SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage daily moisturizer. It feels very light, and not greasy when applied. I find that it provides sun protection throughout the day, and is a good base for make up! I will definitely continue to use this product, and recommend it to friends."
"The first thing I noticed about this product was the smell! It didn't smell like sun screen, thank goodness! I then noticed how light it felt on my skin. It didn't leave my skin feeling oily like other products I have used in the past. I really like how made my skin feel soft. I am pleased with this product!"
I really like this moisturizer however I do feel like I'm kind of just putting on sun screen... I wish it was a little thicker and not so runny like sun screen is. Since it is supposed to do both.. I have not used it enough to notice any drastic changes yet but I can say that these products are easy on sensitive skin. I haven't had a problem with break outs and when I try something new I usually almost always break out!
I got this sample from #Crowdtap. I really like Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF 30. It is a 2-in-1 product that has a daily moisturizer that is not too oily for my skin and also has SPF 30 to protect my skin from sun damage. I already have brown spots and I always put sun screen on my face. I really like that now I can just buy one product that is a 2-in-1 product and save some money too. I would recommend buying this.
The anti sun damage moisturizer begins absorbing as soon as placed on the skin. It has a nice mild aroma to it and doesn't feel heavy at all. You can't even tell it is there after absorbed. Mixed with your regular sun screen for other areas you are set.
"I wasn't sure how I'd like this product when I received it free for review , but I figured it was worth trying out. I have fallen in love with it! I love that I get the sun protections without the tacky, sticky feel of traditional sunscreens. It also lacks the traditional sunscreen smell that seems to hang around forever which is a major plus!"
I really liked the anti sun damage moisturizer! I work outside often and normally have to choose to wear a sunblock or a moisturizer. With this product I can be protected from the sun and moisturize at the same time! I love that this product contains an spf 30 as with alot of other brands it's hard to find anything over spf 15. This product has the best of both worlds and is now a part of my everyday routine!
"I received this product free for review from crowdtap all opinions are my own. I am not a fan of the scent, it smells like faint stale perfume. The product takes a few minutes of rubbing onto the area before it is fully absorbed. The bottle states the main purpose is a sunscreen but due to the inclement weather it is too soon to test for that purpose, but with an spf of 30 that's reassuring. It does moisturize my skin and leaves it with a tingly feeling."
"I love that this has 30 SPF and also works to correct past damage in addition to preventing future sun damage. I also love the pump dispenser--so sanitary! It is noticeably scented but I didn't mind the scent and it definitely didn't smell like typical sunscreen. I haven't noticed any tangible results so far (2 wks use) in regards to lines, wrinkles and dark spots. I do wish it had some illuminating or light diffusing benefits so I could use this stand alone in the summer when it's super humid."
"This moisturizer is hydrating, silky and light-weight at the same time. It absorbs quickly so I can go about my routine and wears beautifully under my makeup. Sometimes I wear it by itself and I love how it makes my skin feel. Definitely a summer must-have!"
"We have been having great weather lately(after a lot of rain)so i have been able to try the Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30. And i really like it. It's not greasy or heavy feeling on my face. And it has a wonderful smell, does not smell chemically like other spf's. This is definitely a must have and i will be using this from now on. Two thumbs up!"
"The consistency was perfect. Not oily or greasy, light but also felt creamy enough for my skin. I have extremely dry sensitive skin, and Rosacea. I was nervous to try this product, and I was kind of surprised it didn't irritate my skin. Not only did it not irritate, it's replaced the much much more expensive brand I had been using."
This is a great daily moisturiser which you can wear everyday and it also comes with SPF protection which is great for summer days.I have a very dry and sensitive skin and it dint cause any sideeffect or acne on my skin.Love this moisturiser and its becomes my new favorite product i own.
While I love the Garnier SkinActive line I was not a fan of the Anti-Sun lotion. I anticipated it to smell like other sunscreens that I have used but it has more of a flowery scent to it which irritates my sensitive skin and burns my nostrils (allergies to certain smells). I immediately washed this off due to that fact.
"I recently tried Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 and I am truly happy with the results. My skin is left feeling soft and moisturized without a greasy feeling because this product is oil free. I always use a moisturizer with SPF and am very happy that this has SPF 30 for daily use. I am 100% satisfied with this product and am very happy with how my skin looks healthier and feels baby soft. Moisturizer also has Vitamin C and E, can't go wrong with extra Vitamins to help keep skin healthy."
"This product not only moisturized and protected the skin on my face, it has also evened out my skin tone. I am so glad I got to try this product. I admit, yes I was skeptical at first. I have trusted my hair to Garnier products for a long time, but never even dreamed they would have such wonderful facial products. Truly amazing line of skin care!"
"Love love looove this product. It's weightless feel is perfect for all day use. On top of that it smells fantastic. It's great for anywhere other than my face, neck and chest. It's the perfect moisturizer with an spf of 30. Definitely getting more when my sample runs out. Thanks for the sample CrowdTap!!"
It's my first time trying Garner sample and I have to say I am pleased with it. The moisturiser cream is very light on my skin and has natural plesent smell to it. It is also not oily. I live in California and need to use sun suncream protection daily and moisterizer. This product is just what I need for everyday use. It is budget friendly.
"This moisturizer is very light and has a nice fragrance. I LOVE that it is SPF 30. I have Melanoma and have been going through treatment for almost a year. I wear sunscreen daily, and this is now my go-to sunscreen for my face in the AM. It had not broken my face out, or made my skin oily-greasy."
Not only is this a great moisturizer with the added benefits of SPF30 but it wears really well under make up. Anyone that adds a moisturizer to their morning routine knows how difficult it can be to find a moisturizer that absorbs into your skin and doesn't cake or streak your make up. Garnier SkinActiv is CLEARLY a match for ladies like us!
The Garnier Skin Active Clearly Brighter Anti-sin Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF 30 is a go to product to be used everyday. It does not leave your skin oily and does add protection from the sun for everyday use when you don't realize you are being exposed to the sun. It is a product I will continue to use everyday.
"Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30 goes on clean and doesn't leave oily residue on your fingers. It is very light on your face and doesn't feel thick or goopy. I like the way it smelled. Very light and fresh. I am not in the sun for very long, but I felt that my fair skin was protected while driving in the car or walking in the parking lot. It also made my skin feel soft and bright! I would definitely recommend this product."
"I am happy about the Clearly Brighter moisturizing sunscreen, It takes a few seconds to get fully absorbed. It does moisturize your skin very well. Its not too heavy. I am very excited to see how well this product can avoid sun damage to my exposed areas."
"I have to be careful with the products I use because most cause my skin to become very irritated and oily. In return, I usually break out badly. So far the clearly brighter moisturizer has been great. It doesn't feel heavy or greasy. My skin isn't dripping from oil at the end of the day, and I love that it has SPF30. I feel great when I wear it alone, or under my makeup!"
"On first use it is phenomenal! Absorbs quickly, and has a light clean scent. No oily feeling, no greasy feeling. Sits well under makeup, no settling into fine lines. Major plus for me. Skin felt hydrated, smoother. As a makeup artist my skin felt airbrused, and was so smooth to the touch. It's now in my kit as well as my bathroom. Highly recommended to everyone!!"
"I'm iffy about the moisturizer to be honest. I think it did well with protecting me against the sun and made me skin feel really soft, it just didn't blend in well when I put it on. My face was just white as could be despite rubbing it in and waiting a while so that wasn't much fun in my opinion. I actually got a washcloth and wiped some of it off because it was bothering me."
"I Used Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily at The Beach today! I Loved that it is A Light Weight,didn't even feel like I had any on! Plus,its SPF30,and,its Oily Free!! No More Getting Clogged Pores!! Very Happy With Your Products!"
"I absolutely loved it!!! I love the feeling it gave me and the scent great.While applying I got a tingling sensation and then came the great scent.Felt really light on skin,nothing heavy.Left my skin feeling soft and smooth. Would recommend this for daily use."
As soon as you apply the product you can tell its a moisturizer. The product isn't heavy or feels oily at all. I really love the fact its SPF 30 for someone who burns easily this is a nice feature. I like the fact it comes in a pump bottle considering this product a little goes a long way.
"I loved this product. It felt lite, not greasy. It made my skin feel taunt and I loved combining it with the eye roller from the same line. i just felt refreshed and noticed my skin was visibly less dull. After just a few days my skin felt clearer,brighter, younger, tighter. I'd recommend it to anyone."
This spreads nicely and hydrates my combination skin. It does not irritate my sensitive skin Nor clog my blemish prone face. I have been using it 1 week and my skin looks smoother and pigmented spots are slightly reduced. Will stick to this and continue to purchase. Am recommending to all my family and friends.
I've been using this product for a couple days it goes on very smooth and smell fresh it does good job of moisturizing my skin but can't use this product ID came allergic too it developed rashes my skin is sentivive and I d recommended the product too other people too use
"I enjoyed the light scent of Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moistuizer. Some daily moisturizers I've tried are too thick and leave my pores feeling clogged, however this did not. It was light and airy. I will continue using Garnier."
"It's lightweight, really does brighten your skin while moisturizing; and my favorite broad spectrum SPF30! Can't beat the price at Walmart!"
"I love how lightweight yet effective Garner Clearly Brighter daily moisturizer is. I had no reactions what so ever, very awesome product."
This is my fave. It has a great smell and the best part is it works. While using it my fave has yet to get sun burned and its made my face really look clear and have a glow.
Absolutely loved the moisturizer sample from Garnier. It provided smooth and exceptional coverage for my aging skin. I especially love how the spf content. Can't wait to see my results after extended use. Thanks Garnier and Crowdtap!
I live in Florida so every day I am exposed to lots of sun. I have noticed with this moisturizer with SPF30 I am not adding unwanted sun exposure to my face.
"Its non sticky and smeels good too. With SPF 30, I am confident that I have enough daily sun protection for my face. It is also good along with my make up."
This product is moisturizing without feeling greasy and it's also very light. It smells great too! I feels really luxe on my skin. I didn't incur any sun damage using it either so it definitely does it's job well!
"Perfect combination for acne treatment and to fade unwanted brown spots! After years of dealing with sun damage , I found my answer! With spf 30 to protect from sun, and best of all , very affordable!! A win , win!!'"
I like this product. I like how I put it on as a moisturizer and it has SPF in it to protect my skin from the sun. It is light and the smell is very light too. It doesn't feel greasy either.
"It's a very light lotion,it's not thick or greasy however I did feel that it didn't absorb well when I tried massaging it in it started coming off.now I don't massage I just pat it on and it's been great.I love it"
I like the none greasy formula. It did not make my face breakout like most moisturizers. I had fewer breakouts. This is a good thing since I have sensitive skin. After a couple weeks of use my dark spots were fading and my face has a healthy glow.
The main thing I loved with this moisturizer a little really goes a long way. It is light weight and goes on smoothly. My skin felt so soft and smooth after using this moisturizer. This is my new favorite moisturizer.

It's light weight. Never leaves my skin feeling sticky at all! I love using it as part of my daily routine. I will definitely be spreading the word on this moisturizer!
"I really enjoyed this product. It absorbed quickly and doesn't have a strong odor. It wasn't heavy, but it was a tad oily on my sensitive skin (this went away after letting it dry completely). I like the SPF protection as well."
"I love this product, it dries on your skin making it so soft. Only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it leaves my hands feeling a little oily or greasy. Only when I use that though. The scent is amazing and its so light on the skin."
"I really enjoyed using this product, it cleared and brightened my skin while being light weight at the same time. It didn't feel greasy or oily at all. Perfect for every day use."
I have fallen in love with Garnier SkinActive Clearly Brighter Anti-Sun Damage Daily Moisturizer SPF30! Now I can protect my skin by preventing sun damage since this contains a SPF30 while it moisturizes. It doesn't leave any oily residue either.

It's really nice it's absorbed into the skin and has a nice citrus scent plus protects from the sun. Wish it left the face a little more matte since I have greasy skin but overall I really liked it

The moisturizer felt amazing on my skin having spf30 is just an added bonus to help my skin from aging
Makes applying sunscreen to sensitive skin easy and with the moisturizers it's a bonus to make a 2step process into 1!
I tried it for 3 days so far and my face is so soft and it actually weeks really well at keeping the sun off
I live in the Caribbean and use this product and for some reason my skin became darker. When used in the sun I got this burnt look. My skin is still very dark .
