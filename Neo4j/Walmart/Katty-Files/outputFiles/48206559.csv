"We live at a high, dry altitude, and these conditions can be brutal on the skin....snow, wind and sun. I use L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Facial Oil twice a day as protection from the elements. It does a remarkable job moisturizing. Love the way it leaves my skin feeling, hydrated, supple and clean."
"I normally love Loreal products but I'm afraid this one is just too greasy for me. It smells great, goes on easily, but is pretty heavy to wear out of the house. It definitely gives me quite a shine and a ""wet"" look. I would recommend it for night use or for around the house but not to wear if you are going out."
I love the feel of this oil/ lotion! Really helps to smooth my dry skin. Walmart was also so helpful and generous in fixing an error that ended up being my fault. I was very pleased with my whole experience.
"L'Oréal is a good skincare line to begin with, so I was pretty certain this would be a good product, and it is. Not too greasy, but does hydrate the skin, and I'm a 61 yr old senior, so I definitely know if my skin is looking and feeling better. Also, a little drop goes a long way, and that's really all you need. I use it morning and then again at night. Love this product!"
I have a very sensitive skin that is prone to adult acne and I was really apprehensive about using this product as it is an oil but to my surprise it is not at all oily in fact its lighter than a regular moisturizer and trust me you can use it in winters as well as summers... It's that dry and a SPF of 30 is a plus plus plus.
"Having truly combination skin, my t-zone is very oily and my cheeks super dry. Wary of putting additional oil on my face, this stuff is AWESOME. It soothes, moisturizes, is surprisingly light and absorbs quickly. It somehow balances things out. You should avoid putting it too close to eye makeup as it will not be too conducive to setting your makeup, but overall is very easy to use. I love this stuff!"
"I have been using it for three weeks now, and here is my experience, I have Asian skin and I don't get sun burn. But I do get tan and my skin gets dry. So I used this oil and it's the best I have tried yet, it's NOT greasy at all. It hydrates skin and I feel I have baby skin, no stickyness at all, no mark of oils on your cloths at all. I love it and I will highly recommend it to all my loved ones. Because it's worth investing, a little bit goes along way"
"This is a light facial oil, perfect under your day cream, night cream, or make up! The added bonus, it has an SPF 30, so you get the extra sun protection we all need. Love it, instant glow, and seems to sink in right away, it's a really good addition to my skin care regimen !"
"I truly can not give a true recommendation of this product because the time frame I have had this product there has been very little sun in our area to see if this kept you from getting sun burned. I can say that I used it and it did seem to help the dry skin areas on my face to be more pliable,soft to touch. For this reason I could recommend this product and will check it out more has we see more sunshine."
"My sister and I tried the Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil, SPF 30 for over a week. We didnt notice any wrinkles fading away but we did notice a real nice softness to our faces. It's easy to rub in without being oily or greasy and leave the face a little moist looking. Easy to apply make up over it. We would highly recommend this oil to any woman looking for a soft dewey look to her face. It's really nice oil!"
"At 68 years old and having lived in extremely dry climates for the past 50 years, my face is dry and cracked. This facial treatment is the bomb. My face is soft and supple now. Still wrinkled but softly so now. Would recommend that you start using it by at least 40years old to prevent the kind of damage I have."
This product is fantastic. If you need a product for your face and not get sun burn this is it. It has spf 30. This product is so light you don't even know it is on your face. When you put it on it gives you a nice glow. And it doesn't just keep you from getting burnt it also hydrates your skin . And that's a plus. Enjoy
"I recommend this for anyone who is having some dryness to their skin... I still have more than 1/2 of a bottle, but just ordered another to keep in stock... I don't want to be without it."
"I really liked this product the oil is non grease an gos on so easily. It is A very lite oil but moisturizes very well, and an added plus it's a 30 spf which all of us need daily.I use it under my makeup with no problems ."
"I received this as a free sample and I loved it. They key is to put it on a little bit at a time. If you use too much at once your face will be shiny. But when used right, it works wonders! (It really moisturizes your skin to leave it feeling silky smooth) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had been looking for a moisturizer that made my dry skin glow AND that provided great sun protection without that chalky feel that most sunscreens have. This is it! I love how it makes my skin feel and it provides amazing coverage -- I have not burned once, even when I am out in full sun all day. (I usually burn easily.). I find the scent very pleasant. Thanks, Loreal."
"As a man, I like my skin routine simple. since I'm in my mid 40s, my skin starts to feel dry so I love using facial oil to moisturize my face. I love this facial oil that also contain SPF 30 to protect my skin from UVA & UVB .... but the fragrance in this oil is sooooo strong that I just can't use it on my face (now just using it on my arms). Please make an unscented facial oil ! otherwise this facial would be perfect with two thumbs up."
"I was skeptical at first. I am not fond of oil based products. This was great, beyond great. Wonderful scent and absorbed into my skin effortlessly. It left a healthy glow on my face. A few drops is all I needed around the forehead, check bone and jaw area. Love this product and would highly recommend using it."
Great price and free shipping. I have used this for years and was having a hard time finding it in retail stores.
Love this product. My skin is very dry and the product absorbs so easily and moisturizes my skin perfectly. Love that it is an SPF 30. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My husband even uses this product after shaving!
Love it.. leaves my skin hydrated and soft.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
She uses this for her face and she even uses it on her nails
"Love this! I have avoided oil my entire life - I produced plenty. This product is the only sunscreen that I feel comfortable wearing everyday. In the Florida heat and humidity, moisturizers made my face sweat. This one doesn't and my skin looks much better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This skin oil absorbs quickly without greasiness. I appreciate the light scent. A little of this goes a long way, so this bottle will last quite a while. It gives skin a healthy glow. Since this is also a sunscreen, I've used any excess on the backs of my hands. It works well there too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My favorite facial oil (for my neck too). It is not greasy, and I love that it has SPF. I would buy in a heartbeat a version for evening without SPF, too! Very light fragrance, and it dissipates quickly. Love this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Only lately I started to use facial oil. I started with Bio Oil, then Argan Oil, and finally found L'Oréal's Age Perfect Oil. For the short time I have been using facial oil, this seems to be the best for me. I would definitely recommend this product."
"I've been using this for about 3months. I got it because the moisturizer I use didn't have sunscreen in it, and didn't want to change or add another lotion. This is very light weight and it it feels great on the skin. I recently put the sunscreen to the test as I was at a ball park all day and did not get a sunburn. I only use a few drops (3/4), sometimes I just mix in with my moisturizer. But most the time this is my last step before applying primer/ makeup. I did want to mention it does have a scent."
"Nice, light non-greasy oil with SPF 30 leaves skin feeling soft and smooth and protected from the sun. If you have very sensitive eyes like mine, be careful to keep it a good distance away while applying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been leary of using an oil on my skin - especially after using the cleanser. However this oil soaks in immediately and does not leave a film on my skin like I thought it might. I believe these products are helping me look more radiant! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin is so dry that I thought I'd like this more than I did. When I used it with the moisturizer, my skin didn't feel hydrated after an hour. I tried it without the moisturizer and actually preferred coconut oil. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product! The oil glides on, then disappears, and my skin feels so smooth . I have been using this oil for about a month and I really can tell a difference in texture of my skin ...my wrinkles are much less obvious....I have to look in a magnifying glass to see them. Oh and a very good thing..I love that it has sunscreen! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product might be great if you are not planning on wearing makeup. I found it to be too oily and I have skin that tends to be a bit dry. The oil was not absorbed and was not a good base for makeup and dry flaky patches were a problem. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product just did not work for me - as a morning product. It was just too greasy and did not absorb quick enough - I have little time in the morning and I never could wait long enough for the product to absorb before putting on the day lotion and then my makeup [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
THIS WAS A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME.. I HAVE NEVER USED A FACIAL OIL BEFORE ...BUT IT WAS SO LIGHTWEIGHT AND THE SPF 30 IS A WONDERFUL BENEFIT...REALLY DOES MAKE YOUR SKIN GLOW..I HAVE SENSITIVE MATURE SKIN AND I CAN SAY I LOVE THIS AND WILL CONTINUE TO USE... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The texture is light not greasy. very much a dupe for the Lancome Precious Oil at 80% less. Smells really good. Have my husband using it as well.
"The packaging, the application, the size and the way it makes your skin feel! Everything is great! Use it everyday! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a very nice light facial oil that is perfect in the cold dry winter air. My skin is very dry, so I use it imediately after shower or wash. After it adsorbs, I mosturize, and then top with a pats of vaselined palms."
"The oil leaves a weird feeling on fingers after you apply to your face. I have to rinse my hands off ever time. It does not have a pleasant smell. Once absorbed, my face does feel softer though."
"absorbs readily into my ultra dry skin - pleasant smell, not at all greasy. Does leave a glow to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product several times but, felt it was too heavy for my skin. It was not greasy, but just had a heavy, masking feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've always hesitated to use any sort of oil on my face. But now that I am getting older, I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did. This gentle oil really is non-greasy, and so light that I have trouble believing I truly do have on sunscreen. It keeps my skin soft all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was a lightweight oil that absorbed easily without feeling greasy. However I felt that the sunscreen did not add much since I only used a few drops at a time, and you should be using a quarter tsp of spf each time to get the stated spf. it would have made a lovely night time product without the spf too. On the plus side it did keep my skin moisturizer in the desert climate I live in. I layer a cream over for maximum absorption. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product. The oil is not heavy, spreads easily and absorbs quickly. I love that it offers an SPF and find the smell quite pleasant. I do layer a little lotion over the oil for added moisture. I have noticed a difference in skin tone since using this item and recommend it highly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this product was a little different because it was an oil. I like that it wasn't greasy feeling and it didn't leave my face oily. However, It didn't feel like it was going on very much. It felt as if it were soaking up on my fingers. It says it has spf protection , so I think it would be more of a product for someone who is outdoors in the sun. All in all I was still happy with the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can't believe that after just 7 days my 49 year old skin looks better than when I was 30! My skin was dry no matter what I used. No longer, my face is silky smooth and the crows feet that I have were getting deeper. Now you can barely see tyhem. And what dark circles under my eyes? Those are gone too! After just one week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The idea of this SPF oil is great but I didn't have luck. I used a sparing 3 drops prior to applying makeup but it made my makeup look shiny and caused my makeup to move around throughout the day. It has the same scent as the rest of the Age perfect line, which I could pass on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This oil gave my face life. After cleansing my face, my face always feel dry. I used the Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Facial Oil immediately after cleansing and my face felt so moisturized and smooth. It smelled amazing. It had a perfume scent but it was not overpowering. I love that the oil is infused with SPF 30 and you can wear it under your make up. I use about 4 drops of oil in the morning and at night. I will definitely buy this product when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have sensitive skin and while I felt the oil absorbed very quickly and felt great on my skin, it also caused me to have a minor break out. I can be prone to acne with my oily skin so I'm always nervous to try new products. However, this product did protect my skin on an afternoon hike and I really liked the way it felt under my makeup. Would definitely recommend this to friends and family!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love that the facial oil has sunscreen in it. The oil smelled nice and was easy to apply. The only thing I didn't like was I think the package looks like it's aimed at older women. I'm in my 30s. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Frankly, this facial oil is lovely. I did not think that I would like it, but I did! A little bit goes a long way, and it doesn't seem to have any negative effects on my foundation. It goes on easily and smoothes into my skin. Unfortunately, the fragrance is too much for me. Package is not ideal. I would much prefer a closed bottle with a pump. I wish this product line was fragrance and paraben free. When used with all products in this line, my skin felt a little bit too oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for a little over two weeks now. Pros: My face looks and feels much softer. Cons: Within the first few days of using it my face broke out. But to be fair, my face breaks out with any change to my regimen. Overall I will keep using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the facial oil works wonders on my skin because hydrating my skin especially during the winter is key. Feels a little greasy on your fingers at first but looks and feels great even under my makeup. Its also great to have 30 SPF because we need it here in Arizona where the sun is beaming on you everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is beneficial to anyone who spends time in the sun. I tried it twice a day although I didn't spend alot of time in the sun it still provided plenty of moisture to my skin. I would recommend this product to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After trying the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil SPF 30 my skin was so soft! I thought it would leave my skin extra oily but in fact it did not! It just takes a small amount and you are good to go. I usually do not use SPFs or oil but I love this stuff!! I recommend this to anyone who needs an SPF and you can even use it on your children, it is totally safe for them as well. No oily residue just nice beautiful smooth and super soft skin!! This stuff is a winner!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love, Love Loved this Facial Oil ! Made my skin so smooth. You dont need much as it is a oil, but i tell you it so light and It smells just hevenly, Way to Go L'Oreal Paris ! Another winner in my book. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do like this product, although I use it sparingly. This is my first time using a facial oil, so I really didn't know what to expect. All you need is a few drops. It didn't clog my pores, but I didn't use this everyday. This will be great for the summer when you're out all day enjoying the weather, it contains SPF 30. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cold winter weather wreeks havoc on my skin, this facial oil helped! Very light and easy to apply that includes SPF 30 sunscreen for year round skin protection. Made my face feel instantly moisturized. Gave me a great glow and people noticed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product line is wonderful. The products actually do exactly what they say they will do. I particularly love the facial oil. It's not too heavy and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy! This product is a must try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This Oil is extremely moisturizing; I would suggest allowing it several minutes to set into the skin before applying makeup. My skin appeared shiny throughout the day, and I noticed that my makeup would come off very easily if I touched it, even later in the day. After just a few days of using it with the face balm and moisturizer, I developed a bit of acne, which I never have; I am 44 years of age and need extra moisturizer, but I found this to be a bit much for my sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thin the facial oil is too scented and a tad bit greasy. Every day that I did use it, I noticed it did not blend well into the skin, no matter how less I tried to use. To me, it smelled like eucalyptus a little too much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am vert sceptical when it comes to trying new beauty products. I have to say. Every day since starting this trial I wake up look in the mirror amd actually see a difference. Its like a 5 year difference. My skin is smoother and healthy looking. I'm impressed and will continue with the regime for as long as they sell it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was a surprise for me. I thought by using an oil I would feel greasy and oily, definitely not the case!! This was a perfect addition to my skincare routine. I loved the fact that I was getting a spf 30 ever day!! It absorbed very quickly and my skin felt so smooth and silky. I even used it on my dry elbows and cuticles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This sunscreen is so light and refreshing. It's really a beautiful smelling oil. I was worried it would be really greasy but it immediatabsorbed into my skin and was not at all clogging. It seemed to hydrate well and kept me from getting burned or spotted! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved how this went on. I wondered if six measly drops of oil could really provide 30 SPF sun protection, but as its winter it's not something I could say did or didn't. This oil was light and spread easily. It also absorbed nicely into the skin and was I very nice foundation for face cream. I didn't have any of the normal waxyness (is that a word) that you get with most sunscreens. Loved! Would and have recommend this to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the idea of an instant glow that also is a sunscreen, but I would prefer another method of application. The drops on the fingers is a little weird for me, I would prefer if it was an spray or roll on system, that you can spread directly to your face. And the perfume is too strong for daily use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the L'Oreal age perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil SPF30 is a great product.Leaves skin feeling soft and a extra plus is it is SPF 30 so no more sunburn or aging from that sun we all love so much.Would highly recommend this product. Using all of the age perfect hydra-nutrition products right now and they are all great. My skin feels so much tighter and I no longer have bags under my eyes. Definally worth buying all four products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I didn't really want to try the oil at first thinking that it will live my face and neck all greased , but for my surprise my skin was left soft as a baby's bottom and oil free . Starting to like more and more [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was the only product in this line that I was not thrilled with. It made my face feel really and look really oily. Perhaps I was using too much of the product, but it was hard to spread if I used any less. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the facial oil over my daily lotion and it goes on smoothly underneath my make-up without streaking. The oil is very very light and absorbs fairly quick, so it makes getting ready in the morning a breeze. My skin also feels softer after putting it on. I do feel a light coating when I touch my face, so I know I'm covered throughout the day. I've been using this in my typical regime and it's been an easy addition. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Facial Oil was light-weight, and non greasy when I applied it to my face. I like that it absorbed quickly and left my face feeling moisturized. It's also an SPF 30 sunscreen so it keeps your face protected from UV rays. It's slightly fragranced but not overwhelming like the other products in the Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition line. I would definitely use it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product after a week's vacation in the Caribbean. The product provided just the right amount of moisture for my sun kissed skin. A little of this product goes a long way. At night I layered the facial oil with the day/night cream. I expected my face to be oily in the morning but it was not. I will continue to try this product as I am interested in seeing how well my makeup stays on with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Hydra-Nutrition facial oil by L'Oreal is amazing! From the first impression until now, going on 2 weeks, it has impressed me. It smells so good and refreshing and my face just radiates. Love love love! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I LOVE this whole system! My face feels softer and looks better overall. I used all four items for the system and felt like this item was unnecessary if you are using all of the other items. Using this in combination with the creams and balms made my face very oily. I think if you were to use this alone or in combination with the eye cream it would work just fine. I had dry skin before using this all and now it is soft and glowing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Tried this product while working out and....afterwards my skin was glowing without a greasy oily feel. Using a few drops makes your skin glow without feeling like you washed your face in a fry vat!!! ❤ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love!! L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil SPF 30 The oil glides on, then disappears, and my skin feels so smooth . I have been using this oil for a few weeks now and I really can tell a difference in texture of my skin. Oh and the best part is it has sunscreen! What more could i ask for my skin looks so amazing in just a few days of using the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil SPF 30 line i would defintely recommend buying it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Well I must say I was a little hesitant to put oil on my face but I wanted to try so I could give my honest feedback about it and I will say that I used like 4 to 5 drops every morning for about 2 weeks now and I will say that my skin was so soft smooth not oily like I thought my skin just soaked it up my face looks refreshed and it has a bit of a glow my skin feels like it did when I was 20 and I love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
What I like about the facial oil is how light it is. I tend to have oily skin in my tzone area of my face and this product does not over moisturize my skin. I also appreciate the spf sunscreen protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The loreal facial oil is wonderful. It's not to oily and goes on so nice. A little does go along way. I love that it has SPF in it as well so I don't have to add more product to my face. Way to go loreal....Great product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the facial oil! I have been using this product twice daily since I received it. It has greatly reduced my skin's natural oiliness. I have been able to wear my make up without touch ups throughout the day, which I was unable to do before using the facial oil. I will definitely be adding this to my regular beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this facial oil! I am a huge fan of oils because of the way they moisturizer your skin and act as a primer for makeup and the fact that this one has a high SPF is amazing! It goes on smooth and is a great foundation for makeup. I like how it looks even without makeup-very dewy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have tried the oil for one week and my skin is younger looking and feels great, not oily like you would think. The directions were easy to read and it is a great investment or your daily skin care. My face feels, and looks great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a good product, it does a good job moisturizing and protecting my skin. You have to be careful not to use too much as it can make your skin feel greasy. I prefer to use lotions or creams that can be quickly applied without worry of applying too much. I am very minimalist when it comes to beauty care. A quick wash, moisturizer and a couple brushes of mascara. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cream does make your neck and chest appear smoother. It gives you a softer look . But do not use on your face. At least for me it was no good. The balm is very very thick and goes on greasy.I tried first on just my neck and chest and felt the greasy feeling but on my face it was way to heavy. It clogged up my pores. The scent is pleasant . The balm also causes you to sweat so I would not recommend using it then go out anywhere. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"What can someone say about the facial cream? Well what I can say is that it makes me feel better and happy not only because my skin feels amazing after every use , but because I know that all the L'Oréal facial creams and oils, war created to make us feel better in our skin, help us look younger with out goingand spending our hard working money on salons.

So I wasn't too sure about putting oil on my face but I did and it didn't cause any issues but this combined with the other products was too much for my face. I felt like an oil slick so I used it on my neck and hands which was very nice. I usually have dried hands from washing them so much and these helped out so so so much. My neck absorbed the oil nicely. Overall love it but just cannot combine with the entire line. I did however put on my husband's face and he loved it too.

"This facial oil will definitely keep your skin from getting dry. It only takes a little and once again your skin will be extremely hydrated and soft. I would've given it 5 stars, but I'm not sure how the SPF 30 will work in the hot summer days. I received the facial oil in December. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I get the theory behind facial oils, like attracts like. But not in this case. This product is made for mature, dry skin, so the oil has a thicker viscosity. My skin is on the oily side to begin with, so when mixed with this, the effect was not pleasant. It felt like it just sat on top of my skin and did not absorb. The product was too heavy for my skin type, so I discontinued use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Has a pleasant scent and soaks into your skin, so your skin is not left feeling oily. After using for one week, my skin feels smoother and softer to the touch. Love that it's SPF 30 so I'm protected from the sun everyday without thinking about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I usually do not do facial oils since I have oily skin but I gave this a go. It worked really well it gave my skin a renewed look. And my skin didn't feel oily at all just soft. I liked this because it also had sunscreen I'm it to help with UV damage. I would recommend this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This wasn't very easy to put on at first. I am not used to putting drops of oil on my face. But it felt really good going on, so I persisted. I finally got the hang of it and I love it. It didn't irritate my sensitive skin. I think it really helped to moisturize my skin. I normally have very dry skin in the winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been applying this right after my shower when my dry skin is at its worst. My face immediately feels more comfortable and moisturized. I have very dry skin and winter weather just makes it worse. This is a must-have for my skin to get through the winter. The only thing I don't love is the fragrance...it's pleasant enough but smells vaguely of lemon cleaner. However, it's a light scent that doesn't hang around... another plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was nervous to try this as I have very sensitive skin. I'm so glad I did..this cream is extremely thick...nice smell and works wonderful. Within two days of use I noticed a huge change in my skin. No dry spots..my skin was soft and full of moisture. This cream does take a little longer to dry before applying makeup but so worth the wait. It's not oily just smooth and creamy and soaks right into your skin. Extremely happy with this product and will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the facial oil was my favorite out of these products. Now if you have a naturally oily skin I definitely don't think this would be a product they would personally want to use but I have very dry skin but especially in the winter and this product helped tremendously. I loved how my face felt using these products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I fell in love with this oil after the first time using it. I have never used oil on my face before. Now I regret that I haven't done it sooner. I love how moisturized my face is after using it. It lasts all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil SPF 30 (1.0 oz). I tried this product for seven days. It was pretty great. Going into this product I wish it would have explained what the great time of use would be. If you are always outside or in the sun this product is for you. If you have oily skin I wouldn't recommend. But overall it's a great product and keeps your skin moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It comes in a cute dropper. This product is like liquid gold it left my face doo smoothe protecting me from the harsh cold weather. I used right before bed. Would definitely buy again and recommend to anyone in their 30s and on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a great daily use product. I try to wear something with SPF every day and I was leery about trying this because I thought it would leave my face feeling oily. However I've been pleasantly surprised that it makes my skin feel very soft without feeling greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was so excited to get these products and to give them a try! I've had a hard time finding a line that I really love! But I think I finally have!!!! My skin has NEVER felt softer and most exciting...no more dry skin!!!!! These products smell great too! My skin is actually glowing! So happy with these products!

This produc goes on smooth and I have used it for one week and can see my poor tired sagging eyes looking brighter and tighter. So easy to use and it sinks into your skin making it feel and look smoother. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tested this out and was pleasantly surprised. I thought that using an oil would obviously make my skin oily. I was so wrong. It was thin and absorbed quickly into my skin. I'm not crazy about the scent but it isn't very strong so, I'd use it again. Facial oils are very on trend now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was confused about the winter use of this sun screen but I used it every morning and it was light and I liked the slight warm look it gave my complexion. If you are afraid of using an oil, I do recommend that you try this one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
At first the facial oil felt very slick and greasy even though I only used a sma amount of the product. I used it over the Age Perfect eye cream and before the Age Perfect day/night cream. Once my skin soaked up all the products I was happy with the results. These products kept my skin feeling very soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I had a bad reaction to the Facial Oil. But the Eye Cream is FANTASTIC!!! The dark circles under my eyes have disappeared and I have very fair skin so even just a little of bit of dark looks really dark. It has also decreased the puffy look of my eyes.

"Clean scent, Non-greasy hydrating formula absorbs quickly into my skin. Has 8 Essential Oils giving a healthy glow too! With SPF 30 Sunscreen that protects from sun also, lightweight n' easy to apply. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Finally facial sun protection that is over 15 SPF. I love that this product is dermatologist tested, is great for sensitive skin and is non-greasy. Admittedly I was curious how an oil could be non-greasy, but it absorbs quickly. It doesn't leave any type of film or oily residue on the skin. This makes it perfect to wear under make up or alone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am not accustomed to an oil having dog in it! This is a novel concept and I love it. The smell isn't as strong as the rest of the items in this line. I've used a lot of like products and this is by far the most affordable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love, love, love this product. At first it was hard to figure out how many drops I needed and put too much on! But my drop number is 4. It is not oily and your skin feels moisturized all day. I use it twice, morning and night. I would recommend this product because it does not leave an oily feeling even in humid weather (Texas). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Day/Night facial cream is perfect for daily use. It's lightweight and creamy. My skin felt smoother instantly! My first use was overnight and I was amazed at my skin the next morning. This is a product that I will continue to use daily and will purchase for some time to come. Thank you Bzzagent!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Beautiful bottle ...but I feel it was greasy once applied to skin..I didn't like the feeling on my skin. To use as just a sunscreen if I was going outside with no makeup may be an option. But to apply any makeup on top of this would be kinda gross. My skin did look less shiny in morning. But had the instant feeling to rinse my face off. I wouldn't recommend. Unless someone's skins was EXTREMELY dryqq [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I kind like the product but I don't know how to use facial oils. It works very well when I mix it with my foundation. I will try to use it some more straight onto my face. It's definitely very moisturizing. Thank you for the product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Loreal age perfect day/ night cream has made quite a wonderful difference in my skin. Fine lines gone, my eleven lines gone. Forehead lines diminished. All this improvement in harsh New York winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Loreal age perfect facial oil with sunscreen absorbs nicely. Helps prevent sun damage while moisturizing skin. Clean light scent. Gentle no sting formula. Even with cold winter winds skin feels less tight. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Using the sunscreen oil helps me to protect my face from the elements. I have been neglectful from using sunscreen on my face and have noticed a glow to it now after using this product. I look healthier which boosts my confidence in myself. I feel pretty again and my sister can't get over the transformation in such a short time of using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the L'Oreal Facial Oil is a good moisture surge, for dry skin. I live in MN, it's winter, and I have found this oil is helping my skin stay hydrated and smooth. I was worried about clogging pores and breaking out, but that has not happened. I am very happy with this product and can tell it will last me a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"YES! This daily facial oil is all I need! It smells soooo good and it is VERY light. It dissolves almost instantly. It does not leave an oily, greasy feel. It blends right into my dry skin and I see instant results!! I had to reapply midday but it was so worth the two seconds it took. It replaces my usual, smelly sunblock. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very skeptical about using oil on my face, especially during the day. However, this all changed after using these last few days. If anything it completely hydrates my skin and makes foundation look so much smoother. Plus my skin feels much softer as well! I would and have already recommended this to friends and family. I have no idea how I managed to do without this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recently was diagnosed with skin cancer and I have been looking for some type of moisturizing sunscreen that I could use every day. I have never applied a liquid product like this from a dropper, but it was easy to use. It didn't leave my face feeling greasy. I like that its not thick like other sunscreens and it also smells better!! My face feels baby soft after using it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the day and nite cream. The product was thick but went on smooth and absorbed real well. I liked the feel of my face some what silky. It gave me a smoother look ony face. I have recommended this toy family and friends. Everyone I hope will try this. I can't wait for future results from this product. I will be posting a before and after picture of my face. I just want to wait a few more weeks so the results will be quite noticeable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have never used any products on my face that is oil based but this Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil was totally different. It wasn't too oily or greasy and it had my face glowing. I am in love with this product. I will be using this daily on my face. My face feels soft and it's not shining but my face looks hydrated. I love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The facial oil goes on quickly and absorbs without a trace. In combination with the moisturizer it makes the dry areas on my face disappear. You do have to use a light application since they are so moisturizing. They can cause greasiness if too much is used at once. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the age perfect, it's really easy to use. You don't have to use alot of it either, I use it everyday and night. I want the best results. It smells real nice and it goes on easily. My skin feels real soft and I'm starting to notice a difference, especially around my eyes.The puffiness is starting to fade away and it hasn't even been a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
tried this facial oil as soon as I got it. really went on smooth and easy and softened the skin right away. worked better than most oils would recommend it to anyone who needs to hydrate their skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So thankful for receiving this product in the mail.This facial oil is prodigious! A little goes along way & its spf protection is great if you get alot of sun.It penetrated deep into the skin &leaving a flawless finish not making your skin feel oily or greasy.The formula in this product is priceless &so if your looking for a good product that won't let you down you must try this out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is great for dry mature skin. It hydrates and not greasy if used in small amounts. I mixed it in with my moisturizer. Again you don't need a lot. I would give this product 5 stars if it was fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the idea of this product is good but in use it leaves a very oily film. I didn't find myself wanting to use it after twice. I don't like feeling oily or wet skin. Honestly I did not like this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil SPF30, LOVE IT!!! I wasn't sure about putting oil on my face but this product isn't greasy at all. I notice a difference in my skin after the 3rd use. My skin feels like velvet and I love it!!! I give this product 5 starts and I can't wait to see the results after using it for a month or more [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Before this product I had never used any type of oil on my face so I didn't know what to expect. I honestly thought my face would be a greasy mess all day but it didn't! It quickly set in and my face felt hydrated all day! I not only have dry skin but it's sensitive too so I love that it has SPF 30 in it too! This product is a win win for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This oil is so light and gives your face such a nice radiant glow. I do not like fragrances in my products, but this one has an addictive very very light fragrance. I've never used an oil with spf 30 protection, but this seems a no-brainer. So, why not 5 stars? I have combination skin and I look for non-comedogenic products. It is not listed by Loreal as non-comdeogenic. All that said, NO BREAKOUTS yet, so I will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The first time L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil SPF 30 using this made my eyes burn and water. I even avoided my eyes when putting it on my face. The next time using this product I made sure that I just put it on my forehead and cheeks to my neck. I avoided a large area of my eyes. Since then I have not had a problem. I use this with L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried the Facial Oil today and absolutely love it! The smell is so good I wish I had a bath oil to go with it. It made my skin feel like silk. Very absorbent and not greasy at all. I want to put this on every day. Left my skin feeling very moisturized and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am not to sure about the facial oil. I began using it as directed on the box and it felt over powering if you will greasy doesn't absorb as fast i would want it too and for the price really not worth it to me. I Wish it was faster absorbing and less greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is excellent and works great my skin. This is my first time using it, I used it when I wake in the Morning, when the Sun is out, it refreshed it my skin. I have more glow in my skin while at the same time it nourishes and moisturize. It's broad spectrum spf 30. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed the facial oil, I was a bit nervous because I tend to have oily areas but the oil absorbs quick and provides great SPF coverage. You only need to use a little bit as it goes a long way. The one thing you should know before you buy is to be careful if you have oily skin. I used this just in the morning before my moisturizer and I didn't have any issues applying makeup! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil SPF 30 and was surprised at how quickly the oil absorbed. It left my skin soft and supple. My foundation and moisturizer went on smoothly also - so this was an added plus! I was attracted to the product because of the SPF 30 claims. I played golf in sunny Florida and my face did not get burned! I wish my skin loved the product as much as I did - I have sensitive skin and my chin area broke out after use - so only rating this as 3 stars *** [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I used this oil for two days and could tell my skin looked brighter and healthier. It was so light weight and did not leave my skin the least bit oily. I skipped using it for two days and could tell the difference. I will be using this everyday from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This seemed to feel nice on my skin and my skin continued to feel that way right up to the next application. Definitely makes a difference in my skin and I can see how this would be very helpful on more matured skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think I'm in love seriously this L'Oreal age perfect facial oil ,just a few drops goes a long way. it's perfect for my sensitive skin . The squeeze applicator is so easy to use. Always go against gravity and within day I saw results and results always make me feel good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried multiple facial moisturizers looking for the right one. I tried the L'Oréal age perfect facial oil was not a very good product at all. When I applied it to my face it definitely felt like oil but it seemed to just sit on top of my skin and it didn't feel moisturizing at all. It was not a good feeling. I would not recommend this product to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was curious about a facial oil ! I love new beauty products so I was ready to try one. If you are at all concerned about putting oil on your face I highly recommend this product. It absorbs very quickly and my face felt silky smooth and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was skeptical putting oil on my face and initially I used too much. But when I found the right amount to use (very little, which is great in terms of how long this product will last), it absorbed beautifully and smoothly. Very nice and unique product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This facial oil is absolutely fantastic! Lightweight, applies smooth and a little goes a long way. It is fast absorbing so it does not leave a greasy film like most products that contain sunscreen. It definitely helped get rid of my flakey winter skin. Also love it is SPF 30 without the sunscreen smell. Will be using every day, year round on my face and chest from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's not my favorite facial oil. I like that it has the added benefit of sunscreen, but it's just too oily for my combo skin. It's a thinner consistency that doesn't seem to sink into my skin like my jojoba oil. I applied it alone and also mixed in with a moiturizer and it didn't seem to make a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I did not care for this product. It is oil. just a liquid oil. It did give me a glow, I feel you could accomplish the same if I put baby oil on my face. It just left my skin feeling like I had a layer of oil on in (because I did). It says it is an SPF of 30. I was not in a sun a lot with this on so not sure how the protection would work for you but You had to re apply frequently. If you have VERY VERY dry skin you may like this product but I did not like it at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Honestly I've used L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil SPF 30 a few times since getting it and just not sure about it. I really dislike the oily/greasy feeling it leaves on my face. I also dislike the smell, it's pretty potent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Thus product has a smooth feel to it. When applied correctly leaves the skin feeling soft and smooth. Defines and fills fine lines and wrinkles. I aquired a few blemishes that may or may nor have been attributed to the cream. Overall I am pleased with the product and will continue to apply it.

"I got this oil in the mail about 2 weeks ago and boy let me tell you.....I use this oil for so many things from moisturizing at night to putting it on my cuticles! This oil is a MUST HAVE, it feels amazing on your face after a long day wearing makeup! I wash off my face before bed and pat dry, then apply the oil..pooof face feels AMAZING! No oily greasy feeling or worry that you'll leave spots on your pillow! Oh and a little goes a LOOONNNG way! Great job L'Oreal new fan here [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is amazing. I was afraid it was going to be too greasy. It was the opposite. The oil absorbs right into your skin leaving it feeling soft and smooth. And add the bonus of sunscreen protection! I love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First off, if your eyes aren't sensitive to avobenzone this might be okay for you. I really wanted to love this product. It's an oil with sunscreen in it. It felt great on my skin, but about an hour later it started to migrate a bit into my eyes. Suddenly, my eyes were stinging and watering so badly, it looked like I was crying. I had to wipe it off and distill eyedrops into my eyes to wash it out. The packaging is in a glass bottle, with a dropper. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Facial oil is a non-greasy blend of 8 essential oils and a broad spectrum SPF 30 sun screen. It has a lovely fragrance and leaves the skin soft and well moisturized. I use it only once before going out & about during the day specially on sunny days. I am giving it 4 ratings only because it is not water resistant. I swim often and therefore had to buy myself a water resistant sun screen. Nonetheless, price is affordable & a product worth buying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is an amazing Sun care product. It makes adding an spf to your daily routine a breeze. The oil is lightweight but adds moisture, no greasy mess! It has a light but fragrant scent, nothing overbearing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am on my third day and i have noticed a slight difference, but not what i expected by any means. I'm going to continue to use this for the full month to see if it is an item that might get better with time or maybe its just not the right product for myself. Lets move forward ans i truly hope it gets bettee for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried this oil now for a few days and it goes on well, you don't need very much, about a drop on the forehead, and one on each cheek. I don't use this for daytime as I prefer a more ""matte"" finish during the day. I used this at night, under my L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Face, Neck and Chest balm, and it feels wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this face oil at night, and again was probably over zealous with the amt. I used. After 30 min. I had to go in and blot my face off as the oil was not absorbing into my skin. It says to use both the oil and the moisturizer but I can't imagine using the 2 products together. My skin was def. softer in the morning and on night 2 I used less and absorption was better. Again i dont think i would use this in the morning before putting on make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The age perfect facial oil is hydrating and the cream is moisturizing however they are greasy and leave my face shiny. They are thick and don't feel the greatest on, they feel heavy. The containers they come in are heavy and not ideal for travel. I want to be able to take these on trips and it's heavy in suitcase. I feel the containers don't need to be a heavy glass. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not a big fan of oils. I'm naturally very oily and dry. This oil actually helped in BOTH areas. Made my skin super soft and hydrated. I'm combination skin, and with the other products in this line, my skin is more even than it was when I was a baby! I'm also big on smells. I was afraid this stuff was going to smell like ""oil"" but it doesn't. Very happy with this product. #PENNYpincherPRO [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I'm always looking for a good way to protect my skin from the sun, this wasn't it, I'm afraid. It really is an oil, and the dropper applicator was an inconvenient tool. It left my skin feeling oily, as opposed to nicely moisturized. It irritated my contacts, but perhaps it's my fault for going too close to my eyes. The scent is lovely, though.

I think you always need some thing to protect your skin from the harshness of the weather and it does not leave your skin oily it also helps when the weather is changing. I live in a place where it is either very hot or very cold and it protects my skin. What I would want to know before I get this product is will it leave my skin oily? No it does not.

"I really like this face oil by L'Oréal age perfect . I was surprised at how quickly my skin absorbed it with no greasy feel. My face and neck felt very soft. I also used this with a moist makeup spong to help blend my foundation and give me a bit more spf coverage. The only thing I didn't like was the fragrance,it's just to stong for the face a bit overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this product. I'll definitely buy it!! Before I used the off brand of face products, you know, whatever was cheapest, but with this I can really tell that you get what you pay for. I think this is worth the money and my skin looks and feels great!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far not a big fan. Thought is was a bit different for a sunscreen. Smells ok, but feels greasy. Do not like the way it leaves my skin feeling. Not sure about how well it works as a sunscreen yet though, stay tuned! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used the eye cream for three days now. I put it on in morning and again In the evening. I love it. I can see a difference yes only after three days. The only thing I dont like is the smell. Dont get me wrong its not a strong oder, but it gas that I dont know that smell. But I will most definitely buy this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wow, this stuff goes a long ways. You don't have to use much of this. It's smells really nice also. I used this while driving around with the sun on my face and it really works. I burn pretty easy and with this on, I didn't even turn pink. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have always struggled with my skin. I am very sensitive to fragrances and my pores tend to clog easily. I was very excited to see this contains a broad-spectrum SPF 30, but is also hydrating because that means one less product I would need on my face. I, however, do not care for the greasy feeling left after using this product. I wear glasses and they are sliding down my nose... Not pleasant. Perhaps it needs to soak in overnight.

This is a fabulous way to moisturize and protect yiur skin with spf30! I live in Florida and spent a lot of time outdoors in the sun and wind.

I love this facial oil. It does not feel oily at all. It is very light and smells nice. It definitely moisturized my skin and did not irritate at all unlike most facial sunscreens I have tried.

I have never experienced a facial oil like L'Oreal Paris' Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil. This was super easy to apply (just a few drops goes a long way) and it absorbed by the time I had the lid off my foundation (WOW!). It had no greese feel afterward. It left my skin silky and it has SPF 30 in it (BONUS!!). I would highly recommend this to anyone who gets the flaky winter skin. This solved that problem for me.

"I used this this morning and it was an instant glow and a daily nourishing moisture for my face, I am on the go and this was the perfect solution. My skin has never felt so good and a day without make-up was wonderful. #thanksL'Orealformakingmefeelbeautiful [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the new L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil SPF 30 to protect my face when I went outside. The sun in Florida does a lot of damage to my skin. Who doesn't want something that has SPF in it and moisturizes your skin at the same time!? It moisturized my skin and I liked that my face was being protected at the same time.

"Being only 37, I was concerned the oil would be too much for my skin. But I was wrong! It's amazing! It absorbs right into my skin. I'm oily in the T zone and dry everywhere else. Does not leave me feeling greasy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Normally I do not like to put oils on my face as it makes me break out. The golden oil allowed my skin to be very soft & supple without any acne. I also liked the fact that the oil is very light weight and does not make my face feel weight down. I definitely plan on continuing to use this daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this cream. Works really well. Not greasy or oily. Has a pleasant smell. Although I wish it smelled a little better. From the start this product offers moisture & noticeable firmness. Would purchase in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the oil is very nourishing for my face and it hasn't left I feeling greasy or oily like other I have tried in the past. It blends in so well and almost leaves a glow on the skin. The dropper is so easy to use and accurate [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Even though this is an oil, don't let that fool you. It is not greasy at all. I was afraid to put oil on my face, I thought I would break out. Just the opposite. I use morning and night and it feels great. At night I use it with the golden balm. In the morning, I use it under my makeup. It makes my makeup go on smooth and even. My fine lines are disappering. Great product for women my age, close to 50. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I did not think I would like it, but after giving it a try, I did! It is not oily and does go well under makeup. The fact it is a sunscreen is perfect and my husband is now fighting me for it...perfect for men! I think this will be very popular! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Of the three products I was given to try, this was my favorite. It is a lovely skin oil, it absorbs quickly and doesn't leave your face greasy, just soft. And it has sunscreen, an important feature for this redhead. I live in Minnesota, and our skin gets soooo dry in the winter. I would have given it 5 stars if the smell wasn't so strong, as most Loreal products are. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When I first saw this I was concerned that since it was oil it might leave my face looking or feeling greasy. It doesn't! My skin absorbs it quickly especially if I apply it right after washing my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is one of my favorite L'Oreal skincare products! It makes my skin glow. I have learned that if I add a drop to my favorite foundation, the foundation goes on more smoothly. I can also use it to sheer out those long-wear foundations that last all day but can look masklike -- not a good look for a 61 year-old. The SPF 30 is a great added bonus.

"I have been known to shy away from facial oils thinking they will be too heavy. But I LOVE This. This oil is no exception. It feels oily for the first few minutes, then seems to disappear leaving my skin very soft and moist. I love that it includes sun protection. I would recommend it.

"Now that it is cold in Texas, this is the perfect skin oil with spf. I reach for it in the morning before I go outside to protect my 60 year old skin from the sun and wind. It keeps my skin soft and supple with no breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Was as advertised and gave a lovely glow. Unfortunately I had a reaction when I used it with its companion products and so I had to discontinue but I would recommend that others try it for themselves. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product itself is very good. I love the lightness of it on my face in addition to the great fresh smell. It definitely serves a good purpose but I probably wouldn't purchase this for sunscreen as it says to use once daily. I would like to have something to put on my face at night, too.

"I became a big fan of facial oils with my first use of L'Oreals Age Perfect Glow Renewal. Now, after trying out Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil, I'm even a bigger fan. It's amazing to me that you can put an oil on your face and it soaks right in without leaving your skin greasy feeling. And the bonus is, it's a sunscreen! What could be better? This may be my new favorite skin care product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is AWESOME!!!! During the winter months when it gets cold outside and heat is on in the home my skin gets so dry and ugly. You only need a small amount and my skin responded almost immediately. It looks like it would remain greasy but it doesn't; it soaks in so well. The fact that you only need a small amount also means it is economically a good product as well as effective. Kudos to L'Oreal for a great product for mature skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"From the first time I used this I could feel a difference. Even though it's an oil, there is no oily feel after you put it on. I do see a difference under my eyes, they are softer. I never thought I'd use oil on my face, but now I'm glad I tried this and will keep using it for years to come. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like how this product works. I was a little hesitant to use oil on my face but my skin felt smooth and not greasy. My face has a glowing look and with the SPF 30 I am protected from harmful sun rays. I recommend using this. Thank you for such a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this product. Mu aging skin needed this product. It is non greasy, hydrating and absorbs well into the skin. I live in the desert and my skin gets dry year round either from the heat or cool weather. It is always dry . Great product! without breaking the bank! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This facial oil feels so good on the skin and left my dry skin looking moisturized, without looking or feeling greasy. It absorbed quickly, which I liked, and I love that it is SPF 30 (very important to me). I do think it gave me a bit of a glow, as well. Would definitely use again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Light weight and easy to apply. I like the dropper. No fragrance! It gave my skin a healthy glow without being glittery or artificial. The product really delivers on its promises. My skin looks younger and smoother. I don't wear make-up and this works beautifully. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This light oil did double duty moisturizing and protecting my skin as well as softening the lines around my eyes. I was very happy to have the 30 SPF protection as so many products do not. Despite being oil, I never felt greasy and it absorbed into my skin almost immediately. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was my first time to use an oil moisturizer, i was pleasantly surprised, it really did give my skin a glow, without being greasy, the SPF 30 was important to me as i have fair sensitive skin, my make up went on smooth and looked good all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wouldn't usually buy an oil for my skin, thinking I wouldn't like the oily feeling it left. But this formula seems to disappear into your skin quickly, and doesn't adversely afffect your makeup application. I especially like it around my mouth and on the skin under my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked this product. It was kind of hard to get used to applying an oil to my face. It doesn't feel greasy once it soaks in and give my face a nice glow. Having an SPF 30 is a nice benefit as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product I really like. At first I thought it would be too oily but it actually is perfect for dryer skin. My skin drinks it up and leaves my face feeling very soft. The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I don't care for the scent they always put in their products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love, love, love this facial oil! It goes on easily with the eye drop applicator. The applicator makes it possible to NOT spill out too much at one time so it lasts longer. My skin feels soft and silky after I apply the oil. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I did not like this oil at all. It had a very unpleasant smell, every time I applied it to my face it made my eyes burn and my lips tingle. The consistency is not thick enough most of what I tried to put on ran down my fingers. Sorry but I would not purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I feel that the Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition-Facial Oil is a good product. It goes on smoothly with no trace of greasiness. I like that it has SPF 30. I used it for several weeks. I'm not sure I need it along with a moisturizer. I think I would be fine with one or the other. I have a problem with dry cuticles and I used this oil on them and I think it helped that problem. I also used it on the backs of my hands to give a moisture boost. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how this rich feeling product was quickly absorbed into my skin. It works well with the other products in the Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition line. It's perfectly for dry winter skin and really helps to keep it moisturized. Since it is not a heavy oil I think it would be great year round and would be really helpful for skin that has been out in the sun. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really like using face oil and did like this product; was easy to use and like the fact you don't have to use a lot to get the benefit of it. Love the SPF 30 - didn't have to worry so much about remembering to use spf. Only downside is the smell - not a fan but otherwise a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked this product. It is a lightweight oil that goes on easily and isn't heavy feeling at all. It has a light fragrance that I found to be very pleasant and it left my skin feeling soft, moist and smooth. My complexion usually does not do well with oils, but this one works very well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Oil as a trial. I was a bit leery to use it, since I didn't want to add too much oil to my skin. However, it was, as advertised, non-greasy and lightweight. At my age, 68, I don't expect wrinkles to miraculously disappear. But I do want facial products to leave my skin hydrated and soft. This product delivers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The oil and the daily moisturizer made my skin baby soft. I had never used oil on my face, but the combination of the oil and moisturizer made a velvety palette for my foundation. Very pretty result. The only thing I didn't like was the scent of the oil. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was rather skeptical of using an oil on my face, since I don't have extremely dry skin. But, I am in love with this product! My skin looks and feels more supple and more like it did when I was younger. The directions suggest using it only during the day, but I often use it at night, too, since its moisturizing properties feel so good. During the day, used in conjunction with the Hydra Nutrition Day Lotion, I've found I need less foundation and the effects of the product last all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the scent and feel of this oil, however I didn't feel like it improved my skin in any way.My skin did not break out which is a plus. I will keep it and try it in the sun as an oil that is also an spf 30 is a big plus and I look forward to trying it in the spring/summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for a couple of years now. It gives my skin a natural glow and a softness that I like. I am a 72 year old woman and can highly recommend this product!
