I love with moisturizer especially now that it has an SPF of 30 in it. I've been using the Regenerist line for years and will continue to do so. I'm 58 and look like I'm in my 40's thanks to using the right kind of skin care.
"I have been using Olay regular daily moisturizer with SPF 15 and it is good, but a little thick with that sunscreen feel. Not this Olay daily moisturizer, goes on much smoother and love the higher SPF 30, great product."
It doesn't make my skin ashy and doesn't smell like sun screen. A winner!Great under make up!
It makes my face smooth and tight and youthful a must have for your face health.
Really works to make my skin stay smooth and bright tone.
Bought this coz I watched positive reviews of this product and I thought it's the best moisturizer for my skin..
"I absolutely love this moisturizer! I've been using it for 3 years now. I love that this doesn't break me out, and it has SPF to protect my skin from sun damage and skin cancer. It is my go-to moisturizer before I put on my make up everyday. I'm 28, and I had some fine wrinkles. This cream has turned back time and my skin is absolutely radiant. So thankful I started using this in my 20s! Worth every penny."
This product has two benefits: sunscreen and wrinkle control. I love it.
I love that this moisturizer has SPF 30 especially in Texas when the temps go as high as in the 100s. I purchased this because of its sculpting power and so far I love it! #contest #influenster
Love the product
First I must say I'm a huge Olay fan. I love that this has SPF 30 so I can wear it in the daytime. The only wrinkles on my face are smile lines around my eyes. I've been using this cream for about 2 weeks and I feel like I see a slight difference. I have dry skin and I apply two pumps of this and my face feels moisturized all day. This cream didn't break me out or irritate my skin. *I recieved this product free from Influenster.com for testing and review purposes. All opinions are 100% my own.*
"My face feels tighter ,baby smooth and i have noticed a slight decrease in my fine lines and wrinkles, it's not greasy smells great and has a broad spectrum Spf 30, it so convenient to slip into your bag not bulky like other sunscreens and the pump works great no clogging . I suffer from Lupus so more skin care with spf works for me I am pleasantly surprised and will continue to use this in my day to day skin care regimen .I was able to try this out for free but this review is my honest opinion."
Great product - good to have the sunscreen - use it every day around my eyes and forehead - seems to be holding off wrinkles nicely :)
"I use this every morning. It's the first product containing sun protection that doesn't break me out! Super convenient that I'm getting my sun protection and moisturizer in one product. Has a pleasant smell and leaves my skin feeling nice, not greasy. I'll definitely be repurchasing! #contest"
"I do love this cream a lot! but i have a question about it....Please if somebody knows informe me... is this product non-comedogenic and oil-free? it is not stated in the description and i have sensitive skin, I've been using it for a while but occasionally i have tiny pimples and I'm trying to fnd out the cause...Help!"
"I have been using Olay Regenerist Microsculpting Cream for about 6 weeks now and the improvement to my skin has been remarkable. My face always feels hydrated and the fine lines seem to be diminishing. And as a further benefit, the SPF 30 makes this product perfect!"
"The first time I used this product I did see a clarity that was not there the day before, I've seen a difference after a week of using this moisturizer. Definitely a certain brightness and ""waking up"" of my skin. It seems as though a dewiness in on my face now. I love my skin care routine now and look forward to applying my moisturizers every morning and every evening."
"I have been using this since it was reformulated. I couldn't use the original version, it was too heavy, and it made my eyes water. This version is perfect for me! It goes on so smoothly, leaving a gentle dewy glow. Not tacky at all. I apply this over the Micro-Sculpting Serum. Usually SPF products, even SPF15, irritates my skin, leaving it red and itchy. This does not irritate my skin in the least. I love this product so much, please don't stop making it!"
"I have been using Olay in the past 30 years and I absolutely love its products, especially the line of regenerist. This product is extremely effective. But compared to the last version of regenerist SPF protection moisturizer, I found it a bit dry in the winter."
"This product DID NOT soak into my skin! Dried to a weird consistency, almost like a hard film, after putting it on and my face looked puffy after using it. I really wanted to like this product but think it's awful! Info: I am a woman, am 51, and have dry skin."
"I bought this thinking I was buying the true Regenerist Microsculpting Cream with sunscreen added. Instead this is basically sunscreen, minus some of the key ingredients found in the true Micrsosculpting Cream, like hyaluronic acid. I don't dislike the product; if you are looking for a good sunscreen for your face, this works. I needed the real anti-aging stuff, though, and feel a little duped by this packaging."
I am very confused about this product. Is it meant as a sunscreen with multiple applications required throughout the day? I was looking for an all-day moisturizer with an anti-aging component that I could wear under makeup. The instructions say to reapply after sun exposure and the feel is so light and dry that I am not sure I am moisturizing my skin. Can anyone help??
"I've been using OLAY products since i was 30, now i'm 55 & recently had a basil cell removed from my face. The Doctor recommended that i use a 30 or more SPF on face & body. When i told her i use OLAY products she was very Happy & so was I. I moved up to the Regenerist Products now & LOVE ALL MY OLAY PRODUCTS!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product really works on my skin. I am planning to try the fragrance-free version with no spf, and the ingredients for both products vary. Putting aside sunscreen factor, would I have difference experience in term of combating aging? *since there are both micro sculpting moisturizers, the other one with no spf and fragrance-fre"
"I love Olay products in general but can only use fragrance free. When I saw this product contained sunscreen I was delighted and bought it immediately. I was shocked when I applied it as to how fragranced it is. Yuk! Why would I possibly want to apply this much perfume to my face? I was horribly dissapointed and unable to use it. Please Olay, skip the fragrance, it's so unacceptable these days!"
"This is my favorite face spf-love the niacinamide and light texture! But wish there was a fragrance free option because I've gotten it on my lips and it tastes like licking a perfume. I'm also concerned that the avobenzone in this is unstable since there is no octocrylene to stabilize the avobenzone/octinoxate. Love it otherwise, though!"
This stuff is AMAZING. Even on the second day I was noticing a difference with my skin and it is not greasy at all. Big pros for it actually working and having a high spf. Only con is the scent. I personally do not like the smell but its not a huge deal breaker. Will definitely be buying this once I'm finished the bottle. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I'm loving Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30. Even though I think I'm fairly young its never too early to start using SPF. This summer with all the swimming and fun in the sun, Olay Regenerist kept my skin moisturized and hydrated. My face didn't feel tight at all. I don't have wrinkles or fine lines but I can tell by the way my face feels that it is also a preventive measure in reducing them from the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I loved using the olay regenerist cream. It felt great, and because I have very sensitive skin I was even more excited that it did not cause drying or a rash. I would reccommend this product to family and friends (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Texture feels creamy, but doesn't leave skin feeling hydrated. Felt an oily top fee on surface of skin as if the product doesn't fully absorb. SPF didn't seem to be a problem, did not encounter any burning or tans. Didn't really notice any major differences in the appearance of my complexion (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This cream had the perfect consistency. It goes on light so you don't feel like you're being weighed down. It absorbs quickly and I can put my make up over it almost right away. My face feels moisturized, less dry! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
My skin glowed with this new skin cream. It smells great and you don't have to use a lot! I really enjoyed trying it and it will become part of my new routine! My friends noticed my skin too and how good it looked! My skin is so soft and smooth! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
This is the 3rd type of facial moisturizer I have tried in recent years that contains an SPF and the first available at regular retailers. I must say that I am impressed. There was very little greasy residue and I could apply make up almost instantly! No clogged pores or breakouts and the benefits or an anti aging compound to boot! I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I really liked that this product did not make my skin oily. I have really bad combination skin and most anti aging products leave me with acne. I'm not sure if I'm expecting to much from a cream but I have seen a minor change in the texture of my skin but definitely liked the moisture in it (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I love a facial moisturizer they makes your dry face feel hydrated but also feel like you have no product on. I didn't have many wrinkles to begin with but the moisturizer seems to help hid them a bit. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Firstly Okay is a great brand! However this cream was nothing special. It was nice and creamy and smelled lightly fragrant and was easily applied. But it left a film on my face, and if I would rub my face, the film would roll and ball and stick to my finger. I didn't use alot, I didn't rub hard, and this was after a couple hours of putting the lotion on. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I put the cream near my toothbrush and was usuing it for a while dag by day. Skin feels fresh and silky. Even with the make up foundation. I didnt get any red spots on my face or the dry skin. I love it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I tried the Olay Sculpting cream. Went on very well and I enjoyed the smell of the cream. I liked how the pump with the bottle gave just enough cream no excess. I personally didn't see the results and made my skin more oily. I quite liked how it have sunscreen so I can be used in the summer out side without dry skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I used the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream for a week and it started giving me pimples. I stopped using it for a few days and the pimples went away. I used it again to see if it was the cream, and the pimples came back. I found it very thick to apply. It felt more like an actual sunscreen than a moisturizing cream. It did moisturize, but it clogged my pores. I wasn't able to see if it reduced my wrinkles as fast as they mention. I had to interrupt my usage of the cream. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"More than impressed with the Micro-Sculpting cream, definitely have noticed a more youthful tone to my skin, I use this product daily and even co-workers have asked what I am doing different as my skin looks so good. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I have tried the Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream. And other then being a pricy moisturizer I saw no change in my skin while using it. For me as a 1 income house there are more cost effective ways to spend money. I will not but this product. I love Olay I just don't love this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been using Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream since I have received the item from BzzAgent. I have heard of Olay before, but I haven't heard of this cream before. I love that it has SPF 30. This cream is light and did not affect my skin, which sometimes gets sensitive to new products. It was easy to use and is something that I can consider buying in the future. Thank you, BzzAgent, for another great product to try! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I recently had the opportunity to try Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, SPF 30 free, through BzzAgent. I honestly didn't notice a difference in my skin. And there was a very fine line between too little to spread, and too much that my skin felt greasy. I will continue to use this bottle until it's, but I won't be buying it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I haven't done any facials for the last two years but when I used the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I've noticed within just the first two uses my face looks radiant and clear. Very light weight and has a non greasy and non sticky feeling perfect for any day time use. Penetrates the face quickly so you can put make up right away specially if you are a woman that's always on the go. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"not a fan of Olay (except deodorants) and would have never bought this product. dry and sensitive skin which i don't find olay suitable for. however, i did like the feeling of this cream for the hot and humid summer days we had. smells nice, feels good. probably won't be using in dryer/colder times, but found it pleasant for the summer and would use again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I love the Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream! It has a light, pretty scent and a smooth creamy texture. As someone with dry skin in some areas and oily skin in others, I really felt that it worked for both. My skin looked more hydrated, refreshed and youthful after just a few uses. My skins texture seemed to improve as well. My favorite feature of all though is that it is SPF 30! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I've been using the Olay Regenerist SPF 30 moisturizer for a couple weeks now. It's a very nice cream. Goes on a bit slick but absorbs pretty quickly. The smell is not overpowering like some other creams. I like that they added the sun protection since it seems we need it everyday no matter the weather. It does the job well and I would recommend this moisturizer to everyone! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I really wanted to like this cream but couldn't. The plan was to try it for a week and then compare my day 1 and day 7 results. The cream was nice and thick and I only needed one pump to cover my entire face. It didn't feel thick on my skin and it smelled pleasant. The downside, within a few hours I broke out along my forehead, chin, and nose. I would not recommend this to anyone with sensitive skin. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've tried the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream with SPF 30. After a week or so of use, I can already see big improvement on my skin...it feels smoother and softer. The lines seem less visible and I feel younger. I highly recommend this product. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Initially when it first came out of the bottle, I was worried that it would be very thick an heavy. Surprisingly, it was very spreadable and actually very light. The scent was not overwhelming and subtle. It left my skin felt soft and smooth after. Overall, it is a nice product that I will try again in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
On day one I loved it! By day 3...not so much. Although I could see improvements in my face ... I always felt heavy with it on. I never used much - 1/2 of a pea size amount at most but always felt that it was 'caked on'. It is not a product I will be continuing to use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I wasn't sure what I was going to think about this product but it pleasantly surprised me. It was a bit heavy for my skin, but absorbed well and left my skin feeling quite soft although a little bit greasy. The product smells absolutely heavenly. I didn't notice a huge difference in my skin, but I also don't have too many wrinkles... yet. I think I would definitely buy it in the future. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I've been trying out Olay's Micro-Sculpting Cream for the past few weeks and I'm impressed! It moisturizes my skin, doesn't irritate or cause breakouts (which I'm prone to) and protects me from the sun! It has a pleasant, non-overbearing scent and it works really well under makeup! What more could you want... I haven't noticed any improvement in wrinkles etc yet, but mind you, I'm 26 and don't have a lot of wrinkles to minimize. I'd recommend/repurchase this product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This is a great product ..I get compliments on my skin all the time just after a few days i really noticed a difference! It always makes my face feel very smooth and soft. It is not super heavy or greasy at all. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
Unfortunately I was really looking forward to this product but I couldn't use it as it made my skin break-out with red spots and itchiness. I do have sensitive skin so I tend to use Olay products as they are usually really good. This one just wasn't for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I really enjoyed trying this product. I know that I should be using SPF in my cream everyday, but this makes it super easy. It doesn't have that typical strong 'SPF' smell which I like. My skin is nice and smooth no, so it's been a good change from my usual cream. I like that it's a product I can buy easily, and it isn't a specialty trip like my usual cream is. I will be adding this to my list for when I run out! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Both products are amazing, I like that the hairspray still leaves your hair soft and manageable! I noticed a big difference in my skin after about 10 days of using the cream. Skin appeared and little tighter and healthier! Definitely recommend both products!! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I would definitely use this again. The cream has a soft floral scent and I am told that it deeply hydrates, leaves skin dewy, and improves tone and texture over time. I will have to keep using it to see if I notice a difference. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really like the way my skin feels when I apply Olay Regenerist micro sculpting cream , it feels smooth and moisturized but I don't really see any difference in the fine lines. I was working outside quite a bit and thought it offered really good sun protection. I use it morning and evening and do like the way my skin feels after applying it, not oily at all. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I think this product is really great. I started using Olay Regenerist micro-sculpting cream with sunscreen 2 weeks ago and I notice a difference already. The fine lines around my mouth have much less noticeable. I love the fact that this moisturizer contains SPF 30. One less product to apply. I highly recommend this product and will be purchasing it when this container is depleted. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"This is a great moisturizer. I haven't noticed a HUGE difference in wrinkles, although to be honest, I wasn't expecting to. It's a lovely, lightweight cream that absorbs really easily and makes my skin feel hydrated. Love the fact that it has sunscreen added and that I can combine two steps into one in the morning. Be careful not to get it in your eyes though - it feels exactly like getting sunscreen in them.... which I suppose it is. Overall, a great product and I will continue to use it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Great product. I've been using for 2 weeks now and am seeing the benefits. My skin looks smoother and brighter. It feels tighter. At my work there's a device to test skin hydration and over the last week I've seen an improvement on the hydration levels. The product has the classic Olay smell I love. Only 2 small pumps covers my face and neck, so that's a bonus. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Love how well this spreads and dries. My first thought was I'd be through the tiny bottle in a week but just a little amount covers my entire face well, smelling lovely and drying quickly, without any greasy feel. Haven't noticed any visible changes despite using it every morning for the last 3 weeks before putting on make-up, but I'll finish the bottle for no other reasons than that it smells good, has SPF, and feels fancy :) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"SMOOTHER SKIN NEARLY INSTANTLY This product did everything it claimed to do. Instantly I noticed a smoother complexion. Very quickly there were reduced lines and a more plump, yet firm appearance. Definitely quickly absorbed and a non-greasy feel. I really like that it has a SPF built in. Best Part was #GOTITFREE due to Bzz, Olay! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I love this stuff especially that it has the 30 SPF. I put in on and was out for 3hrs in 30degree weather and my face did'nt get burnt a bit. And i love how it makes my face feel and look. I will definetly be buying this again. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
So I'm not a fan of makeup so I'm all about good lotion and spf all the way So first I'm a mom and I run a dayhome meaning no point in makeup lol this cream is wonderful my face feels amazing and soft not greasy or to thick just a beautiful light cream I'm not sure what it's scluped much but my skin does feel firmer I told my mom and friends. About it and they have also had great feed back loving this product (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I liked the claims this product had and in general I love olay products. This one felt cosmetically inelegant and didn't really absorb well into my skin. It felt oily like regular face sunscreen and left a sheen even half an hour after application. I didn't notice any difference in my fine lines. On the plus side, I did feel line it kept my skin moisturized. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I don't have sensitive skin, but this moisturizer made me break out like crazy! It's also very drying, probably due to the copious amounts of alcohol in this product. I only used for a few days before discontinuing to allow my skin to clear up. Two thumbs down! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I have been using the product for a few days. I do like the smell and SPF, and it is a good moisturizer. It doesn't feel greasy (yay!) but I haven'T noticed any wrinkle-reduction or changes in the appearance of my skin otherwise. I'm in my early 30s, so perhaps the difference just isn't noticeable, so I will keep using it to see if anything changes. Even so, I'm not sure that it's worth the price it retails for (though I'm happy to have it as a free sample to try!) (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I've been using Olay products for years but I had never tried the Olay Regenerist Advanced Anti-Aging cream before. It's been 2 weeks and my skin feels so soft! I love that it has sunscreen with SPF 30 so my face is always protected. My skin feels moisturized! The cream has a nice light scent and doesn't feel greasy. 5 Stars for this product! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I really enjoyed trying the Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. After only a week I could see that my skin looked firmer and smoother. After 2 weeks, wrinkles showed a little less. The SPF 30 helped to avoid sun burns while going out this summer. I even helped me survive an improvised day at the beach! The only downside for me would the strong scent of the cream. The fragrance is really present but it smells nice. Overall I would recommend it! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I am still loving this product. I have been using it for over two weeks and my skin feels soft and silky. I love the smell! Although I don't know if it is doing anything for my wrinkles ( not that I have many!) I guess only time will tell :) I will keep on using this product. #GotItFree (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"Pretty great sculpting cream. I think at first I was put off because I was expecting a moisturizer.. which would be lighter than this. It felt a little thick and clay like at first. Once I got past that, I enjoyed using the cream. Huge added bonus that it has SPF 30 sunscreen in it, so you don't have to put on multiple products. Makes my skin feel soft and smooth, and protected! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I find this very nice and smooth going on, feels light and absorbs quickly. I have tried lots of products over the years and normally break out badly in a rash with anything with sunscreen in it. I haven't broken out at all with this product. It has made my skin softer and more resilient in a short time. The scent is OK, not fabulous. While I am enjoying the product I am unsure as to whether I'd pay the price for it at the store. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I had stepped away from using Olay of Olay for awhile and it has really become a top contender in the mid market facial business. the cream is smooth and lightweight - spreads easy and best of all contains a 30spf. After a few days of use my face and neck felt smoother and looked brighter. Not to mention having a built in sunscreen both protected my skin and stopped me from having to add sunscreen to my face. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I chose the Olay Regenerist moisturiser as I liked the look of the packaging. I also am happy it has SPF 30 also. The cream felt light on my skin. It absorbed well and my skin felt hydrated after application. I would definitely recommend this to anyone concerned with wrinkles and hydration. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have used oil of olay products all of my life from the time i was 18.i am now 54.i have bought several products.this is very oily.and leaves a residue on your skin.i have tried several of the newer skin care products from oil of olay now.just a very disappointed customer.sad really.because i have loved all the older products.just seems like things have changed with oil of olay [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So far so good. This cream goes on smooth and feels weightless. It also has a nice scent that is not overpowering. I have not been reapplying every 2 hours like it suggests because that is crazy. I have been using it once a day for 9 days now. The claim is noticable results in 30 days. I have taken a before photo and hope to post when done. #gotitfree (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I have been buying Olay products most of my adult life. I was recently given the Olay Regenerist to try from Bzzagent. You really can't compare this product equally because it compares to very high end products. I've bought a lot of high end products over the counter and online. This Olay is non greasy, goes in smooth and feels and acts like a high end cream. The only thing I would change is that the scent is somewhat strong. Other than that, I love it. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I liked this cream at first sight. It smells good and it feels good and absorbs fairly quickly. I did find my T-zone a bit oilier than usual but I assume it's due to the SPF, which I would normally wear under my regular moisturizer. I did find the cream hydrating and currently use other Regenerist products, so I will consider adding this to my regimen after I've tried this a bit longer.

I am absolutely loving the olay micro sculpting cream. It smells amazing and keeps my face feeling fresh! We spend a lot of time outside so I like to put it on in the morning and my skin is protected and smooth. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I am absolutely in love with this lotion that I received from Olay and BzzAgent! It's so nice and light, it doesn't leave any oily residue. And after using it for a week, I can definitely see a change in my skin, it looks so much healthier and brighter. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really enjoyed this product. It left my skin moisturized, plump feeling, and dewy looking. I like how it contains sunscreen so I don't have to add SPF in an extra step. The packaging is great as well. It's sleek, easy to travel with, and the pump gives the right amount of product. The one drawback is that it has a very slight sunscreen smell, but it doesn't last after initial application. I would recommend! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I feel that all Olay products are very nice. This cream was moisturizing although not enough for my dry skin. It was skin smoothing, as far a ""sculpting"" and wrinkle reducing I would say I haven't noticed much of that yet and I am about 2 weeks in. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream is a girls best friend! Now that I am of a certain age I need the help of face cream Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I was surprised at how quickly my wrinkles started to fade after only using the cream for a few days. I love the soft and smooth texture of the product. The lotion absorbed quickly into my skin. I will buy it, and I would highly recommend this face cream to anyone who daily uses face lotion. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I enjoy the moisturizer. The texture is great and a wonderful consistency. My only complaint is that the recommended skin routine is cleaner, serum, eye cream and then moisturizer. It make my morning routine much longer! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I really loved the DNA superstructure cream, my face never felt greasy and my pores looked smaller and my skin looked fabulous. I have been using the Micro-sculpture cream for over a month and I am not impressed at all. My face feels greasy it doesn't seem to absorb into my skin and my pores look terrible. I hope you reconsider and bring back the DNA Superstructure my skin is begging you please ."
"I can't wait to put this on my face every day! It gives me a light reflecting type of glow, it makes my face feel soft and gives me a dewy look, with a smooth texture to my skin. Normally I'm skeptical of facial creams, but this one is definitely a winner! I love that it has SPF in it too! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"OLAY Regenerist is a great light cream for daily use. It doesn't feel heavy or greasy on your skin. You can use a very small amount to go a long way. It also contains SPF 30 for sunblock. It seems to be odorless as well, so if you have any sensitivity to scents it would be a perfect choice for you. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
I absolutely love this product. One use is all it takes to see this moisturizer work. I have really back acne scars and after just one use they weren't as visible. And all you need to use is a pea-sized size amount.this is also a product that you don't have to special order you can find at most retail stores. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I have tried this product for few days and am really enjoying this. I have let my mom use the product as well and she is liking it too. I am very excited to be able to use this product or future use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
I love this product. It really feels refreshing on your face when you apply it. The only thing is the first time I used it I put a lot of the product on and my eye teared up cause it was like too refreshing but then it was ok. Probably just put a lot too much on so I learnt my lesson!! It really moisturizes and I feel wrinkle free :_ (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)
"I love this product. It is very effective at moisturizing my skin without a heavy feeling. Nice light scent and is great base under my makeup. It has been a very welcome addition to my beauty routine, especially given the dry, hot summer we have been having! My skin looks great! (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"Smells great, only 25 but I hear it's never to early to start preventing aging! I have very fair skin and am always a little lax about the sunscreen, but diligent about ,moisturizing, so two in one is great for me. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"After trying some of the most expensive amino-peptide lifting creams, this Regenerist cream is the absolute tops for me! I don't have to be concerned if I'm doing my best for my aging skin because this not only makes by skin look fresh and luminous, it gives me added confidence that I look my best. Olay has been looking after skin for many decades, and this cream reflects their dedication to our skin (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"This product did everything it claimed to do. Instantly I noticed a smoother complexion. Very quickly there were reduced lines and a more plump, yet firm appearance. Definitely quickly absorbed and a non-greasy feel. I really like that it has a SPF built in. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I am juste start the product however, I feel a slight change to dark circles. The color is a little less dark. I'll continue to use it to see if it works in full. I can't give a perfect note, but it appears to act. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I seldom use the cream with sunscreen cause it normally is oily, and make me get some zits. After i using micro-sculpting cream on my face, i notice it right away it is not greasy. Besides, my face absorb really fast. I don't have many fine wrinkles so i can't tell if it reduces the look instantly. And it really smoothes my skin's appliance. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
"I like the soft scent of the cream which wasn't over powering, it's a light refreshing scent which is important. The cream itself is silky on my skin and not tacky after its applied. My favorite thing about it though is that it doesn't make my skin break out, it has softened the skin on my cheeks which can sometimes feel rough. I think this is a great alternative to a more expensive brand moisturizer. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)"
This Product is amazing! I am 35 years old and have already seen the changes on my skin through my mid 30's I needed a good Anti Aging/Moustirizer cream that was good and cost effective and this is it. I started to see the results after 2 weeks! No more flaky skin plus my completion seems radiant. I will purchase again & I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I must say that I have a very sensitive skin to start with so I am very careful about what I use and hardly ever use any cosmetics. I think this stuff does make the skin around my eyes look smoother and lighter, and it certainly moisturizes without being greasy. I'm pleased with the results and certainly the price!"
"A little dab will do you. Is not heavy creme but light and goes on real smooth. I cover my face, neck and chest each day before going out doors. Last all day and it takes so little amount and the bttole seemds to last a long time. Skin is softer and less wrinkles with each use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream with Spf 30 for several weeks & I love this stuff. My skin feels softer & smoother & looks great. I love that it has SPF 30 which is good for my fair skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was 12 when my Mum first introduced me to Olay complete. It truly was the epitome of Beauty creme back in the 70's. I have stuck with them as I introduce my daughter to the line and myself to new, revolutionary cremes and moisturizers. The Regenerist micro-sculpting cream with SPF30 streamlines my routine and makes me smile, albeit without so many lines! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was looking for a lightweight and non greasy cream with SPF 30 to use daily under makeup, but wouldn't feel greasy or heavy and this is the perfect cream for that. So lightweight I barely know its there, perfect sunscreen protection without the greasy shiny aspect that alot of SPF creams have. I love it and highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used this product along with other Olay products for many years and have seen a noticeable difference. My Mom used the original Olay lotion for years and I definitely will continue to use the various products on a daily basis !!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Goes on with ease, and you need only one pumps worth for the entire face. You can actually put foundation over it without having to apply one or two more products over it in order for your foundation to go on smoothly, and.... there are no balls that form. Gives your face a lift and youthful look. A great new product. Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I live in Southern California, the land of the sun. I NEED good sun protection and I WANT a good moisturizer for my aging face. Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream with SPF 30 Sunscreen does both beautifully. And even though I'm in the sun every day, my skin looks great. Thanks, Olay, for the best moisturizer I've ever used! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The micro-sculpting cream is amazing! The good news: It leaves my skin feeling so soft and I truly believe its fills in the small lines and crevices I have at age 72. The bad news: My husband won't keep his hands off my cream. He says it help with the dryness, particularly on his forehead. I highly recommend this product, but buy two--one for your husband and one for you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream has been a great moisturizer for my skin and has helped to reduce fine wrinkles. It also has the Spf30 which helps to protect my skin from further sun damage. The cream is not greasy, makes my skin feel soft and works great under my makeup. I don't go a day without applying this great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the Regenerist micro sculpting cream for little over 1 month now and my skin not only feels smoother but looks it too. As soon as i put it on my face and neck I feel the richness of the texture, the beautiful scent is calming, and the effects are amazing. The only brand I trust. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love Olay best products ever I have been using Olay for years and I love it. They beat any other product out there I won't change for nothing thanks so much Olay you are the best. I don't look my age I look 10 to 15 years younger love it thank you my face is radiant and glowing people say I look great love it I look and feel great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I feel I am really doing something good for my skin when I use Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. Not only does my skin feel softer and smoother, I love the fact that this cream comes with Spf30 because I am outdoors a lot of the time. This is a product I really recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Regenerist line was recommended by my dermatologist. I've used this cream for years and truly believe it has helped to fight deep lines and wrinkles. And now, as a bonus, it contains sunscreen. It's perfect! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay since it was called Oil of Olay! That was many many years ago and I am always complimented on my skin. I am 62 now and have been using the micro-sculpting creme for a number of years and love the way it feels on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using Oil of Olay for over 40 years. When the Regenrist line by Olay came to market, it was an easy decision to try it. I've been using the ream with SPF 30. I love ho light it feels on my skin! There's no heavy, greasy feel. No unpleasant fragrance. I'm eager to add more from this line to my daily regime! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My new favorite regenerist product. I've been using this line for a few years including the night cream but this is now my ""go to"" day product for summer. Not greasy on my face and good sun protection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have always used Oil of Olay product and now that I am older love all the regenerist creams. I have had several skin cancers over the years, but never on my face because I always us the cream with spf 30. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As a 50+ person who still has oily skin, I love having a single product that acts as a serum and a sunscreen, so I don't have to layer on several products. The scent is very nice and the product is comfortable and effective. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this cream for 4 years now and my skin had improved a lot. Before my facial skin was dry ,wrinkled ,saggy and with brown and liver spots.Wreckles are all over my cheeks and neck but after using this microsulpting cream day and night my skin changed and my daughters and friends noticed and gave me compliments that I looked good and young with my age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
this product does not feel greasy. i love the texture of it - i have sat for hours out in the sun and does a great job of protecting your skin. I also like how it feels after you apply your makeup. i have had several compliments on my skin since i started using it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the best moisturizer I ever tried. This is non oily ,so I really liked it. It stays all day long. You can apply foundation on top of it. I have used my cosmetics from the department stores but I found no difference between the branded & this one . I have & will always recommend Olay Brand to my friends & relatives. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how smooth the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream feels on my face and neck. I previously used olay regenerist regenerating lotion and find the Micro-Sculpting Cream hydrates my skin much better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been a user of the Regenerist line for years and was so excited when Olay came out with a daily micro-sculpting cream with sun screen in one. Great product that absorbs quickly and allows my make-up to go on smoothly. It backs up its claims! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love Olay products. The regenerist cream is wonderful. It goes on smoothly and smells lovely. It always left my skin looking and feeling good with no greasy after feeling. Plus is has SPF 30 which is great since I live in a sunny climate. I received this product free for testing purposes and all opinions are my own.
"Used for over 4 weeks and my skin has tightened and the small wrinkles around the eye area and forehead appear much better. I have fair, sensitive skin- I used this every am underneath my makeup and I had no issues with sunburn, no rashes or breakouts from this product. Has a nice smell too! *I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. I was not compensated for this post; however, I am creating this post as part of a contest. All opinions are my own."
"I am pretty happy with this product. I have noticed a difference in my skin texture, visibility of pores and smoothness and fine lines, since trying this and I will be buying! It feels nice and not greasy as I expected it to for some reason and I love that it has a sunscreen in it! (I'm a sunscreen nut so this is wonderful!) ** I received a free bottle of this product from influenster in return for my honest review. All opinions are my own. **"
I received this product for testing purposes but the review is my own personal opinion. I just started using this product and I absolutely love the way it feels on my skin. The scent is very light and it also has sunscreen to protect my skin as well. I'll definitely be purchasing.
Great protection from sun damage (spf 30). It makes your skin feel silky smooth. It's also easy to apply. It's best applied to moist or damp skin. It enhances it to absorb easier. I am a happy customer and would suggest it to everyone. I received this product for free for my honest opinion and I love it.
This moisturizer is very nice. It's not too heavy or greasy but it moisturizes well. I love that it has sunscreen. I haven't used it long enough to notice any other effects other than it being moisturizing. I received this product for free to test in exchange for my honest opinion.
"I love this product! Olay are the best OTC products you can get, in my little ol' opinion. This one has sunscreen so it definitely has a thicker, more hydrating consistency but I have super dry skin so I love it! Someone with oilier skin might want to use more sparingly. But, to feed my skin and protect it from the sun at the same time -- win-win. I will definitely be repurchasing when I am out. (I was provided this product for review, but opinions are 100% honest and all me.)"
"This is a light moisturizer that sits nicely beneath makeup. I really love the fact that it has SPF 30 in it, meaning I can combine it with some of my non-SPF foundations. The moisturizer also has a nice scent, which lingers all day too. My only gripe is that I don't really think that it is good value for money...I think there are moisturizers currently on the market that are similar for a lot cheaper! I received this product free for testing purposes."
"I havent finished my 4 weeks that it recommends you do to see the differences, but i do see a diffference in the redness of my cheeks. I leaves me feeling soft and smooth. Not oily or shiny, which is a huge plus. Great product that i will continue to use."
When I was given this product complimentary for testing purposes I was skeptical bc usually any face products I try to use leave my face oily or cause me to break out but after using this product for a few days I found that it left my skin feeling softer & didnt break out my skin at all. After using it for a few weeks I can say that it has improved my skin & I will not be going back to prior face products.
I was given this product as part of an Influenster campaign and I never thought I'd like a face lotion this much. I love that it has SPF and the scent is seriously great. I will absolutely be buying this again and I highly recommend it! Large bottle too!
"I used this product and it was great I suffer from dry skin and it worked so well I bought another one is a bit expensive but so worth it. Smells great, love the feeling, I would recommend to anyone it was a great product. I try it for free but all opinions are my own is a great product."
"I love the soft, silky feel Olay lotions has on my skin, leaving it feeling moisturized but not oily. With this product I enjoyed the added sunscreen element keeping my skin safe. The only problem I have with this product is it's price point. I feel it's a bit pricey for the amount you get. I tested my Olay product for free, but all opinions are my own."
"This is such a wonderful product! I love the way it makes my skin feel and it smells great. Its smooth, easy to apply and makes my skin look so much younger. Its a perfect size and worth the value. I would recommend this product to anyone. I received this product for free and all views are my own."
"I have to tell you that this is by far the BEST product I've tried from Olay. There are two little ""frown lines"" beginning to form between my eyes after a mere week of using the cream, they were greatly diminished. This is one product I'll be adding to my daily skincare regimen. The Microsculpting Cream is also great because it absorbs quickly (feeling almost like a makeup primer) and the scent is light."
"This micro-sculpting cream smells amazing and feels great on my skin. The bottle isn't huge but a little goes a long way so it should last for a while. This doesn't feel oily and goes on smoothly, leaving my skin feeling firmer, soft and more vibrant! The SPF30 is a huge bonus for me! I received this product for free from Influenster but all opinions are my own."
"I am in need of some anti-aging products in my skin care routine, I'm starting to see small lines and age spots all over my face! This product smelled great and was light to the touch, I also loved that it contained SPF. This cream blended well into skin and my makeup was applied as normal over the top with no issues. * I tested Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 30 for free, but all opinions are my own!*"
"This makes the DRY skin on my face feel soft and I can feel it tightening when I first put it on, it also tingles a bit.This cream is absolutely perfect for days like today when I don't plan to wear makeup and would provide the protection I would get from makeup. It isn't oily which most people probably prefer. I received this cream for free to evaluate and this is my honest opinion of it."
"This cream is pretty lightweight, so it doesn't overwhelm my slightly oily skin. It wears well under my makeup, and I love that it has a higher SPF. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the scent, but fortunately it doesn't last. I received this for free for testing, but the opinions are my own! :-)"
"Not only does this product feel luxurious and nice on the skin, but it absorbs quickly and works great underneath a full face of makeup. I did notice that I became more oily throughout the day than I normally would if I wore this underneath my makeup, however it's a small price to pay for the improved texture in my skin. This product was sent to me for review by influenster, but all opinions are my own."
"My skin's fair, oily & sensitive. Most days, I don't wear powder, just foundation as concealer - this doesn't add shiny-ness. I live in FL, so I use powder more as it gets hotter, & this is great under whatever make-up I wear. SPF 30 sunscreen is fantastic! I've worn this in FL sun by & in the pool plus on the beach, & I've yet to experience pink-ness! (I've never taken time/effort to re-apply as recommended). I tested this for free, but opinions are mine. I'll be buying for cont. use daily."
This moisturizer is fantastic. I have been using it every morning after I wash my face and before I put on any makeup. A little goes a long way. The texture is very smooth and light and the smell is wonderful. Its also great that there is sunscreen in it. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes but my opinions are all my own.
I have sensitive skin and so I have to be very careful about what I use on my face. As I'm getting older I realize it is very important to you something that does have a built-in sunscreen. This product is not only amazing but it really does help my skin to feel protected throughout the day.
This product worked well. Wasn't too greasy for my skin and e joyed using it . Wasn't too heavy either and enjoyed that it has spf in it to help out with my easily burned skin . I tested this product for free for testing purposes and all opinions are my own!
I was nervous about this product but really ended up liking it! My face didn't feel oily at all and I think it really helped to make my skin look better! My skin looks and feels more even after using this product. It is great for summer too because of the SPF level. * I received this product free for testing but all opinions are my own.
"I was lucky enough to receive this product complimentary for review purposes, but all opinions are my own. I love this moisturizer! As someone who's super fair, I always have to wear products with SPF. This was light and didn't make me feel like my pores were clogged. Highly recommended!"
"Pro: Lightweight feel Did not break my face out with use Easy to wear under makeup Cons: Smelled like sunscreen Did not notice any significant improvement to my complexion, moisture level, ect I received this product as a tester for free. All reviews are my own."
"This SPF 30 cream was safe to use on my face, seeping in almost immediately upon application without leaving any residue. It has a nice light-weight texture which is easy to wear under makeup or to apply before or after your favorite moisturizer. I received this product for free for review purposes via Influenster."
"I am coming up on 30 and am FINALLY starting to see the benefit of proper skincare. When I tried Olay Regenerist *(provided to me by Influenster for an honest review) I was weary because my first thought with sunscreen is ""oily"", but I was pleasantly surprised. I did not have an oily residue and the smell is wonderful!!! Also, after 4 hours in the sun, no burn! I wish this was big enough to use on my whole body. HA! Loved it!!"
I am a face moisturizer junkie. I have tried so many that I love and hate. Okay never disappoints. I found this moisturizer with spf to be thick and highly moisturizing. The added benefits of the spf are great for wearing under foundation that lacks any or enough spf. It has a very pleasant scent and great feel.
I've always been a fan of Okay products and this cream does not disappoint. I've been using it for a few weeks now and already notice a difference in my skin. Fine lines seem to be fading and it leaves my skin feeling moisturized all day. I also love that this product has spf 30! Winner. I did receive this product for free in exchange for my honest review.
"I've been using this lotion for almost a month now. While I don't see any less wrinkles, I would say my skin is smoother overall. It is possible this lotion is preventing wrinkles from appearing. I do like that it is a lightweight moisturizer I can wear during the day, under my makeup and not have the feeling my makeup is melting off my face. (I tested this product for free, but all opinions are my own)"
"This smells amazing, smooths on amazing, works amazing and I highly recommend! I was skeptical of some of the claims I do admit, however it actually did make my skin feel smoother, healthier, and better protected. I tested this product for free but my opinions are entirely my own. I WILL be buying more of this when I run out!"
"At this price point and small size, I wouldn't use this as my regular sunscreen--you'd have to use too much for coverage. This is a perfectly acceptable moisturizer, but I can't say if it really improved my skin's texture or not. I received this product for free but my opinion is my own."
I have used this product for a few weeks now and I love how it makes my face feel. I use it as a moisturizer and primer before I apply my foundation and it works well for me. I haven't noticed a lift or younger-looking skin. But I attribute that to the fact that my skin didn't sag or look more mature before I started using it. I received this product free for testing purposes but all opinions are my own.
"This stuff isn't cheap but it is very much worth it. The cream just feels like quality. A little bit goes a long way. Its smooth and thick, but not greasy. I have sensitive skin and it doesn't irritate my skin at all. This leaves my skin feeling soft. After a few days, my skin did feel firmer. The scent is not overpowering, its light and airy. The SPF factor is great, especially for my fair skin. I tested my Olay product for free, but all opinions are my own."
"You should wear SPF every day, but some don't want to add another product on top of moisturizer & anti-aging products. Check this out! The SPF coverage is decent & while the texture at first can feel odd it absorbs as fast as my other moisturizers & doesn't really have an after texture. 1 pump covers my whole face easily. Having a pump makes sure you have a controlled amount of product & keeps the product sanitary. I received this product free for testing and honest review via Influenster"
"I love the way this product feels on my face. I did apply at before going out in the sun but my nose still got burnt but not near as bad as it normally does. I didn't realize this until I was actually posting this review, but I was thinking this product didn't work but the more I realize how bad my face could have been burned by going off of what my shoulders looked like, I am very pleased with this product and will definitely be buying it and recommending it"
"This face cream makes my face feel super soft and smooth. I don't have many fine lines or wrinkles but, I firmly believe that's due to always wearing a moisturizer/sunscreen/spf since my teenage years. The cream has a pleasantly light fragrant scent. It rubs into my skin easily and doesn't make my face feel oily or sticky. I have sensitive skin and this cream didn't burn or cause my face to break out or turn red. I received this product for review and all thoughts and opinions are my own."
"While my skin felt soft, it was a little oily and it didn't reduce my fine lines as I was hoping. I'm not fond of the fact that I have to reapply it every 2 hours though especially with the amount given in the bottle, you kind of go from a decent amount to not so much, but it's only been a week and a half, maybe it will improve. The scent isn't overbearing but that was really the only plus that I could find."
"I don't normally use ""drug store"" products, but this one surprised me. I love how smooth it goes on and doesn't leave my skin greasy. It smells really nice and fresh, too. I did notice that after a couple weeks of regular use, my face looks fresher and somewhat more toned. No additional breakouts or other skin irritations, and I consider myself to have sensitive skin! I tested this Olay product for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I've been using this everyday since I got it as a moisturizer and sunscreen. I love that it feels hydrating and yet not heavy. My skin feels naked, like it's just a better version of my own self. I keep going back to this product over and over. I think the packaging is nice too and the price isn't bad. It's really important to me that it has such good sunscreen too, you definitely need good SPF everyday! I got this product free for review from Influenster."
"I have quite dry dull looking skin. I have been applying this every morning since it has sunscreen in it, it helps protect my skin every day so that's an added bonus! I love that it has a pump, it makes it much easier to use and apply. The smell of product isn't overpowering and I enjoy the smell. It does good for helping my dryness it doesn't dry me out anymore and helps with what I already have. It doesn't break me out either. It has helped my face look more radiant!!"
"I liked this cream, but it unfortunately broke me out. I'm also a HUGE Olay fan. They have awesome stuff. It won't make me hide from their other products. On the up-side, I just have sensitive skin, and this stuff goes on smooth, and non greasy, I think it just matters on your skin type. I may try it again in a few days/weeks. I received this product for testing purposes."
"I wish I could like this product but I am sensitive to scents on my skin, especially the face. It has a little perfume scent to it so I was afraid of getting a rash. The lotion itself is great. Its thick and moisturizes great. The SPF is a great benefit!! I recieved this free for testing purposes complimentary from Influenster.... all opinions are my own."
I have younger skin with very minor wrinkles ( if any) but I do have uneven skin from acne. This product has helped make my skin so sooth. Smells amazing. The sunscreen does not sting my face like other products. Hydrates skin with out feeling oily. Absorbs quick into the skin versus sitting on top. Wears well under makeup or alone
"This is an amazing product. I don't have many fine line or wrinkles for it to take care of but I do live in Arizona so my skin is almost always dry, and this really helped improve the texture plus as a nice little added bonus it has 30spf. I did notice in 7 days that my skin did feel a lot better, both by touch (it was smoother) and by there not being tightness around my lips and nose. I do recommend this product! I did receive product free for testing services but all opinions are my own."
This product works well to hydrate and protect from the sun's damaging rays. It doesn't feel heavy or overly greasy. It smooths on well and doesn't have an overbearing smell. I would recommend this product. I received this product free for testing purposes.
"Sticker shock, this product is expensive. However, it works!!! Leaves your face feeling smooth and certainly protects against sun burns. (I even missed a spot to prove it). This product doesn't have a strong smell making it nice for everyday wear. I was given this product free for testing purposes, the opinions are my own."
"I have enjoyed this product so far. I like the scent associated and also how soft it leaves my skin. I have noticed minimal ""tightening"" but I think as I continue to use it I will notice more perks. One huge plus is the SPF, I am always nervous about facial burns. I have extremely sensitive skin but have not had any issues or breakouts with this product."
"This product was a new addition to my routine. I usually just use a regular moisturizer with spf, but this one seemed to smooth my skin better. I used it after a shower and before my makeup. I have used it for about 2 weeks now, and my skin does feel smoother, the small lines around my eyes are still there, but it may take more time. Overall i recommend this product, even if it's just because my skin feels smoother. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest review."
"I was already using the one without the SPF 30 in it - so this is an added bonus. It doesn't have any off-putting smells and goes on smoothly and absorbs quickly. Be careful not to apply TOO much because then later when you rub your skin, you will get a residue that comes off. My forehead is where I am noticing the most results. I have a very dry forehead and it ages me a LOT. I received this product for free to test but my opinion is mine alone."
"I received this product for free via Influenster to test. I would have to say that I do enjoy how soft it leaves my face feeling. A little does go a long ways. As for it protecting the sun, I am sure it does just fine but I have not been able to be in much sun here in MI with a rainy spring."
"I am obsessed with this stuff. It is so moisturizing and there is a noticeable difference in my wrinkles. I like to apply it directly out of the shower, focusing around my eyes and neck. It really decreases the puffiness and fine lines. 5 stars! I received this free for an honest review."
"This has spf and does NOT smell like sun screen! Before applying makeup for a party or somewhere I know I will be sweating or have my makeup for a long period of time, I use this because it is pretty pricy. But it works so great and it makes your makeup stick on so good. After applying foundation and bronzer you will still smell the product and trust me it smells so amazing. I tested the Olay product for free, but all opinions are my own."
I use all the Regenerist collection & I have to say they did it again. This sculpting Cream makes my skin look bright and healthy while the sunblock is protecting my skin all day. I love how Smooth and healthy my skin looks without any make up with this Cream. I highly recommend this product.. I LOVE it..
"This Olay Cream has become part of my daily skincare routine! I love that it has just the right amount of moisture for my face, without that greasy feeling, plus my skin looks healthy and it protects my face from sun damage! I tested this product for free and this is my honest opinion."
I can't switch up my facial moisturizers due to allergies but I did try this on the backs of my hands. That skin is like your face and I liked the idea of the SPF there also. I can absolutely feel a difference and I will continue to use it twice a day on my hands. You need the tiniest amount and it goes a long way. I received this product for free to try but all opinions are mine! :)
"I may only be 26, but I spent my life outside most of the time. I already have sun spots and places from past deep sun burns. Now I'm keeping up on skin protection! This product is great because it combines hydration, protection, and sculpting all in one product! It helps me cut back on my morning beauty routine and is a great value. I can already see a difference this spring in the lack of sun damage! I did receive this product to try for free but my opinions are my own!"
The best time to start an anti-aging regimen is in your 20s so that's what I'm doing. I received this product for free but my opinions are all my own. I have normal-oily skin and noticed that towards the end of the day it was a bit shinier (why I gave it 4*) so take that into consideration. I love that it has SPF in it! It has a soft but great smell and it goes on like air. It feels so good to put on after I clean my face! I've noticed my skin tone is more even after using this product.
"As a redhead in her 30's I am concerned about sun damage and freckles! Freckles in my teens and early 20's were cute, now they are sun damage. This product goes on smoothly, feels light and rehydrated my skin without a greasy feeling. A lifelong fan of Olay, I'll buy this product ASAP! I received this product free in exchange for an honest review, this did not influence my opinion."
"I just got done with a run of a play, which meant I'd spent two weeks abusing my skin. Too much makeup, too much sweat, too much scrubbing, bad food, too much drink, and far, far, far too little sleep. Receiving this product (for free) to test, was a great help. Good scent, good texture, good results. I wish I had the full line -- I will have to invest and get the full benefits. I recommend this, especially if you need to make up for not taking care of yourself for a while."
"I recieved this product for testing purposes via the Influenster program, however all opinions are my own. I heard so much about this product, I was so excited to try it! The formula is thick enough that it feels hydrating to the skin without feeling too heavy. The spf is nice addition, allowing you to go out in the sun to garden/cut gras/relax and keep the skin hydrated without worrying about burning."
"My skin tends to be super dry, and if I weren't pregnant (and my skin weren't going nuts on me), this would easily be my go-to daily moisturizer. It feels smooth and soaks in, leaving only a slight product feel on the surface of my skin (thanks to the sunscreen). (Disclosure: I received this product for free in exchange for a review. This doesn't affect my opinion.)"
I have been using this product for a little over two weeks and I have notice definite improvement in the texture of my skin. I have really seen a difference in the lines under my eyes and my overall appearance. I use this in the morning before my foundation and at night before I go to bed. I normally don't spend much on skincare items. I did receive this complimentary for product testing but I would definitely consider purchasing this.
"I have been a fan of Olay for years as my mom used it growing up so I was excited to try this product. It did not disappoint. I love the scent that is not too strong and the fact that it contains SPF, so I can use it daily under my foundation. It also absorbs quickly and does not leave my face feeling greasy. I tested this Olay product for free through Influenster, but all opinions are my own."
"I love this moisturizer because it goes on so smoothly and also for the SPF factor. I don't have many wrinkles (yet!) so I can't comment on the wrinkle factor but I do notice a difference in the moisture level of my skin. I like the smell a lot, not too strong but still has a pleasant scent to it.I got this product as a free trial from Influenster and I really enjoy using it as part of my makeup/skin care routine and would recommend to friends."
"I really love the feel of this cream! It's a nice formula, almost whipped in texture. It doesn't feel too heavy on the face, which is great for me since I have combination skin with a lot of oil around my t-zone. I love that it includes spf as well! The only con I have is that it's overly-fragranced for my taste -- that's just unnecessary for a facial moisturizer! I received this product for free for my unbiased, honest review."
"I LOVE the scent of this. It doesn't smell like icky sunscreen or boring old moisturizer. Is it weird that I love that I'll smell it randomly throughout the day? I also love that it isn't greasy, like a lot of lotions/moisturizers with SPF can be. It's a perfect base for foundation. *I received this product for free to review."
"It took a couple days for me to see some results, but the creases on my forehead are less noticeable. It feels really nice. It is not greasy like most products that have sunscreen in them. I put it on before I put on makeup. My makeup doesn't melt off because of it which is really nice. I think it is expensive. I can't say I would buy it since that doesn't fall in my budget. I tired this product for free, but all opinions are my own."
I love this product and have actually purchased a spare for when I run out. It leaves me skin glowung my husband said. It makes my skin feel smooth and doesnt leave a residue or make my face oily. I received this product conpliments of Influenster in return for my honest feedback.
"I was excited for this product to try it, since I had just ran out of a similar product from my regular brand. Sadly, this didn't do anything really! No tightening of pores, no wrinkles disappearing. And the fact it says to re-apply every two hours.... Shows me it REALLY doesn't work. Skip on this one!"
"I'm an Olay addict, and I was so excited to receive Olay REGENERIST MICRO-SCULPTING CREAM WITH SUNSCREEN BROAD SPECTRUM SPF 30 in my Influenster P&G VoxBox for free in return for an honest review. I've been using Olay for years, but this might be my new fave. Smells great, smoothes on easily, absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling soft and supple."
"I love the SPF addition to this product. After using this product for a week I do see some difference in my skin. The packaging is great too, I love the pump instead of putting my fingers in a jar everyday and risking cross contamination! It does have a fragrance, so might not be a good choice if you have any type of allergy to fragrance. I do have sensitive skin but it did not irritate. I received a sample in exchange for feed back, however the opinion is my own."
"Okay, this stuff is amazing! Once I started using it, I almost immediately saw results. The lines in my face are less visible and my cheeks and jaw area look less saggy. I even had people tell me I looked younger while using this! I tested it by not using it for a few days and could tell a big difference in my skin. This has a nice, light scent and SPF 30, yay! I've tested this product for free but all opinions are my own and 100% honest."
I received this product courtesy of Influenster VoxBox for an honest review & honestly...I'm loving it! Been using it in my morning skin care routine. Applying it to my undereye area. I use it right below the orbital bone to a little above & extend it to the outer corner of my eye. I swear I can tell a difference in the appearance & smoothness of my undereye area. Its a cream product & has no noticeable smell. I'll definitely purchase this product after given this opportunity to review it.
"There are few face creams that I would recommend, but that isn't the case with this product. After the first five days I began to notice an improvement in the firmness and texture of my skin. I also love the sunscreen protection, because when I work outside my face doesn't burn at all. The only problem I have is the scent, which can be very overpowering. An unscented version would be awesome. (Disclaimer: I tested this Olay product for free, but all opinions are my own)."
"being so fair, SPF is an absolute must for me. this product is really nice to have, I just wish it wasn't so heavy on this skin. I grew used to it though, so it didn't bother me after a little while. I received this free from influenster to honestly review."
"This is the perfect facial moisturizing product. Olay has done a great job, it makes my skin look and feel great while providing my with SPF30. Its a great combination product that keeps my skin looking and feeling younger, while at the same time protecting me from the sun. Such a great product, I definitely recommend! I received this product for free but the opinions are all my own."
"This product was really nice as a night cream or a cream if I wasn't putting on make up for the day. I liked how smooth it went on and didn't feel heavy, but it is a heavier cream. I prefer a very light lotion or moisturizer with spf for under my makeup each day, but I would use this during a day at the pool or beach or before bed each night. I received this from Influenster to test for free."
"I am very picky about moisturizer in that I don't want ANY greasy residue after the product has dried and soaked into my skin. So glad that Olay Regenerist doesn't have that! I was previously using mens moisturizer because I have had trouble finding a good women's product that wasn't sticky and filmy. I also put it on my neck and upper chest, as that is often forgotten with SPF and I don't want that skin getting damaged either. I tested this Olay product for free, but all opinions are my own."
"This product leaves your skin feeling so soft! My skin feels smoother and younger after only a week of use! I'm not sure whether it is wishful thinking or not, but my skin see,s to already look and feel younger! I received this product free to try in exchange for my review, and I am quite impressed!"
I received this product for free to test and review. I am glad I received it. I love Olay products! Every time I have switched I always go back. I have had this for a little over one week and I already see a difference under my eyes. Smoother skin . It is great that theis product is non greasy and helps concealer go on perfect! It works. Wonderful products as always
"I am in love with the way that this cream feels on my skin, it is light but so moisturizing and absorbs very quickly. I have fair, sensitive skin and this is gentle and provides a good amount of SPF protection for everyday use. I received this product free to try but all opinions are my own."
"I'm happy that Olay came out with a nice product with a high SPF, but I'm unsure of how to re-apply every 2 hours with wearing it under makeup. I wish they could up the longevity. That's a lot of upkeep that probably won't happen. It is lightly scented and not too bad, and the texture is nice on my dry senstive skin. I got this for free, but all opinions are your own."
"I'm not a fan of sunscreen on my face. But I burn easily due to a health issue and a medication so now I cannot go without sunscreen. This moisturizer feels good on my skin, without the heaviness of usual sunscreens. I don't detect a sunscreen smell. I'd be happy to use this every day! I got this product free for review and this is my honest opinion."
First of all I love that fresh clean scent and I love that you can't feel it on your skin after you put it on. I love everything about this product and I love the level of spf. I got this free from p&g through inflienster to test and review and I am all about it. Love it.
"I have been changing my skin care products to ones that will hydrate and improve my skins look and feel. The micro-sculpting cream from Olay will be a new product in my lineup - it has done great in the past few weeks that I've used it. I'm impressed with the quality and results I get with this product. I did receive this product free for testing purposes, all opinions are my own."
"This stuff has a really nice smell, and I love the thickness of the texture. I'm not sure if it's really doing anything for my skin texture yet, but so far I've been loving trying it out! It's a thicker cream, so it feels very luxurious. To me it is a bit pricey, but for a thicker cream such as this, I expect to pay a little more. I received the Olay Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, but these opinions are all my own."
"I tried this product as I am very fair skinned with dry skin so I needed something that hydrates my skin while protecting. This was absolutely great. It was creamy, felt so amazing going on and really did a good job. I feel it could definitely be lower priced so it can be affordable for all income brackets. Overall though, I do recommend this product especially if you have dry and fair skin like myself. I did try this product free but all my opinions are my own."
"I love this cream!!! it's not too harsh on my skin but my wrinkles are already diminishing after just a week of use!!! My only complaint is that my skin is oily and there is no oil-control in it. Otherwise, I love this cream!!! I tested this Olay product for free, but all opinions are my own."
"I haven't used Olay products in quite some time, I was apprehensive about this product because I naturally have oily skin, however, this left my skin feeling fresh and looking radiant! Plus the added bonus of SPF!! Yes! *I tested this product for free, but all opinions and reviews are my own."
"I really like this product and I feel that I noticed a difference after a few days of use. My skin just seemed plumper and less saggy around my neck and on my face. I like that I can use it as a moisturizer and apply product over it. I also like that it contains sunscreen, even though they say to reapply every 2 hours. I really like the smell and feel on my skin and it isn't greasy at all. I received this product for free to review, but all of the opinions are my own."
"Unlike other SPF blended moisturizers, this one doesn't make my face shiny so I don't worry about looking like an oil slick as the day goes on. My face stays well moisturized and it wears well under makeup. The moisturizer smells amazing! I haven't been using it long enough to see if it helps with my fine lines but I really enjoy it so far if only for the fact that it has kept my face from drying out throughout the day! I tried this product for free in exchange for my review."
"OLAY REGENERIST MICRO-SCULPTING CREAM WITH SPF made my skin feel so refreshed! A long weekend with little sleep left my skin feeling dry, but this product gave me the hydration it needed to go back out into the sun again. A great light formula with SPF as a bonus! Please note I received this product complimentary for testing purposes."
Let me start out by saying I would buy this cream just because it smells so great! It's also a huge bonus that this product contains sunscreen and helps with aging. This will be my everyday facial moisturizer this summer. I am very grateful that I have found a lotion that smells so good and doesn't clog or grease up my face! I received this product free for review.
"Anti aging and sunscreen are my two key must haves at the beginning of every spring. We aren't getting any younger ladies! I love the feel of this product, not too heavy or oily, and it's a fantastic value. This product could easily cost 3x more from a high end brand. Highly recommend adding this moisturizer to your daily routine!"
"Received this product for free in return for an honest review. This product is honestly fantastic!!! It makes my face feel incredibly soft and smooth. I'm prone to sunburn across my nose and cheeks, and this has prevented it without the oily feeling of a sunblock."
"I got this in exchange for an honest review. To be honest I don't care for it at all. Its supposed to be lifting/ firming, but it left my skin feeling oily and greasy. I normally like Olay products and they are fairly effective, but not this. It just left my skin looking gross. SO THIS IS A PASS FOR ME."
"First thing i noticed about this product was the nice packaging and bottle, the cream itself has a very nice scent and is easy to apply. It goes on smooth and even, and it doesnt make my skin oily or shiney. Its sme is very refreshing, a great addition r o my morning routine. * I recieved this product as a sample for in exchange for an honest review. This revies is my own personal opinion after using thus procuct"
"Perfect formula for sun protection! I'm always looking for great skin care products with strong spf. This fits the bill for sure. Goes on smoothly (not like some lotions with sunscreen) and absorbs quickly. My skin felt tighter and well moisturized. One negative I found is the smell....it's very strong. Otherwise, this is a good product! I received this product free to test, but all opinions are my own."
"This week I received a free sample of it and I loved it! I usually use facial moisturizer with spf and let me tell you that this one is the best that I've tried. I pump it twice for my face and neck. It doesn't feel sticky or greasy at all and smells fruity, unlike the usual sunscreen smell you get with solar protection moisturizers. The smell lingers for a while and it doesn't bother me, I actually like it. I use it under my makeup and when I have none I reapply the cream every 2-3 hours."
At 1st glance I was very surprised with the slim bottle and amazing smell. I've been using it and have definitely noticed a difference in my skin. It's super soft and feels firmer. My skin doesn't feel oily which I was a little worried about trying free from Influenster for testing purposes .I will definitely be purchasing once I'm out of this.
"Excellent feel and weight, love the softness of my skin, I apply it everyday the first thing in the morning and it lasts all day, I really love the scent and the SPF30 is a big plus! Also, the pump dispenses just the right amount of lotion. I'm in love with it! ""I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own! """
I absolutely love this product. It smells amazing and feels great on my skin. It goes on very easy and a little goes a long way. It is also a very good size and one bottle will last you awhile. I was able to try this for free but I will definitely be buying this when I run out!
i wasnt sure at first..the price was a bit high but i got it free from influenster to test and review ....i tried it before bed and woke up with much firmer skin. and pores were minimal too...i have been using for 3 days and totally in love with instant results!
"This is a silky smooth cream that sinks into your skin making the skin firmer and smoother and it's added sunscreen is a major plus! Great start your day step in moisturizing the most important part of your body, your beautiful face! Keeping it beautiful with Olay is where it's at! I received this cream free of charge for testing purposes and all opinions are my very, very own! Awesome product as always!"
Worked how it was supposed to. Felt great going on. But by then end of the day it kinda felt heavy on my skin. Oily heavy. It could also just be bad timing of the month and hormones. But it did what it was supposed it. Malden my skin feel great after I washed it again.
This product is fantastic. I use it every morning before i head to work. It is a great moisturizer and it will even help protect your face from sun exposure. Not to mention I love that it is an Anti-aging moisturizer that hydrates your skin as well. The best part is it doesn't leave your skin feeling oily. It smells amazing. Not to over powering just a nice fresh clean smell. I did test this product for free but these are my own opinions.
"For someone like me who doesn't use a sun screen , this product is perfect because it not only moisturizes and firms the face but it also has SPF 30 . After just one use i loved how my skin felt. Already recommended this to my mom. Although I got this product for free the opinions are my own."
"This moisturizer is really light and I love that it has the wrinkle prevention and SPF30. Watch out if your skin is sensitive or you use other products as it can sting a little bit. It goes away and didn't irritate my skin but the products within it must be strong. I will continue to use it and see if my skin gets used to it. The scent is very light and fresh. I tested this Olay product for free, but all opinions are my own!"
"I am so incredibly in love with the cream and the feel of this product.The product itself is light and creamy, it blends in smoothly and effortlessly in my skin. I have seen a reduction in the circles under my eyes!! Thank you Olay for this wonderful product. I received this product to test for free, but the above information is all my own personal opinions. I hope they help potential buyers!"
I received this product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. This particular moisturizer is very good. I haven't noticed huge differences in any repair...yet. But I do love the non-greasy moisturizing effects and I'm happy that it now has SPF 30 in it. I will continue to use it in the hopes it will be effective. I also have to wonder if I need the complete system for this product to be effective.
"I love this product as a moisturizer-it hydrates, lays well under makeup, and doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy. I've used it under makeup and as a night cream, and it works both ways. The price is a little steep, but worth it for something that moisturizes and has SPF. (I received this product for testing, and although free, I was in no way compensated for my review. My thoughts are my own.)"
"Most sunscreens that I've used tend to leave my skin shiny and greasy looking. This product does not leave my skin shiny at all. In fact, after applying this cream, my skin looked fresh and very matte. My foundation was easy to apply and looked great."
"Prefer this serum over the cream, and it definitely works well on the fine wrinkles when applied."
Been using it for years. Makes my skin feel hydrated and protects from the sun
It smells good.
I have been using this product for years. I am almost 60 and no one ever guesses my age most people guess my age to be 10 to 15 years younger than I am. Combine this with some retinol products and it's a win-win.
"A great daily moisturezer to use after facial serum. The SPF is good enough for me during the winter months. During the summer, I would add a separate sunscreen."
I love everything that Olay makes they are a great company and know what their doing when it comes to skin care ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
but a good friend of mine use thisfjrom the first day until now .and she love it I saw the result it really works and her skin really soft and made a different..so I'm gonna try this one day..im wondering if its good for an Asian brown skin like me?

My Skin has lost red spots and feels tighter. You do not need much at all and the pump is a great idea. It made a difference in a very short time and would definitely continue to use. (This review was collected as part of a promotion.)

"Feels great on my face and I love that it contains SPF because I don't have to wear an additional sunscreen too. I tested my Olay product for free, but all opinions are my own."
I let my mom try this and she likes it. She lives using sunscreen to help prevent hyperpigmentation. I got this for free to try for review through influenster.
"I really like using this product because it makes my face feel soft, doesn't cause breakouts or my skin to be oily, and protects my face from the sun. However, I have seen no difference in my skin since using it."
"I love everything about this product. I like how it makes my skin feel, how it looks and I love the smell. If you don't like facial products with a strong scent, this is not for you. But if you do, buy it."
"I love love love the Olay Regenerist line in general (try the eye cream also!) and this was a welcome addition. I will always go back to this line! I tested my Olay product for free, but all opinions are my own."
I've been struggling with oiliness and this cream helped with that! And my skin feels more firm and supple. I received it for free from influenster for reviewing purposes and these opinions are my own.
"I love this product! It is light, effective and didn't clog my pores. I am outside a lot, so I like knowing that my skin is protected without sacrificing my skin. I received this product for free from Influenster for testing purposes."
It smells very nice . It goes on very creamy. I feel it's not very expensive either . I liked how it had an easy pump. I havnt had it too long but I did notice result. My skin feels super moisturized and it's nice that it has an SPF
"I love this day cream for several reasons - it goes on smooth, works well as base before makeup, it provides SPF 30, it's not irritating and doesn't have an overwhelming strong scent. What more can you ask for!?"
