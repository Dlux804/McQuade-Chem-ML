"I love this cream! When you apply it after your cleansed skin in the morning it glides on evenly and absorbs in your skin leaving it feeling fresh, supple, and glowing. I liked how it had a very light scent. I've been using it daily and my skin looks so much brighter without the use of cosmetics."
"I am in love with the Earth to Skin Super Fruit Citrus Day Cream! First it smells so fresh and clean. It's consistency is very gel like. It only takes a little bit of cream to cover the entire face. It feels amazing on my skin, absorbs nicely without leaving any residue behind. It leaves my skin feeling super soft and looking dewy. I really love this day cream and can't wait to buy it for my mom!"
"This is the first gel cream that I have tried. I really like how well this gel was. It is very light weight and moisturizing. It leaves a nice dewy look to my skin. A little bit if this cream goes a long way, so you really only need a small amount. I think too much would leave a heavy feel. The scent is also really nice and refreshing. I can't wait to see how my skin looks after a few months use."
"I love this day cream! It doesn't make my skin feel oily or like it has something heavy on it, and instead feels very refreshing and soaks in quickly. My skin feels softer, and I already think it's helping with my skins texture, along with reducing my fine lines. Super impressed with this, and will continue using for sure!"
"I had a great experience trying out, Earth to Skin Super Fruits Citrus Day Cream. This is a very light weight gel, it goes on so smoothly. I also loved all the ingredients and benefits. This moisturizer is amazing and I will continue to use it. It really makes my skin look brighter."
"When I first tried Earth to Skin day cream I thought it was a little sticky but when I had it on, it dried nicely and felt good on my skin, and not sticky anymore. I thought it smelled good, the bottle was was small enough for travel, and it was easy to open. I may buy again."
I definitely love the scent. It smells like melon and definitely refreshing. Also it feels hydrating and not too dry or wet after application. Feel like the skin is hydrated too. It works well for oily skin too since it got absorbed pretty fast after application
"I love this citrus day gel cream! It's made with Vitamin C, Lemon Peel Oil and Orange Fruit Extract. This cream claims to brighten, illuminate, and leave skin radiant. I've being using it for about two weeks now, and I really like it. It's lightweight, and is not greasy. It's also absorbs quickly into the skin leaving it hydrated and moisturized. Overall, I really like this day cream, it leaves my skin soft and glowing."
I received this product free for my honest opinion.
"I would need more time to post the exact honest review of this particular product, because, as far as now, I have been using it for a couple of weeks only, I do really like the citrus scent and the texture of this gel-cream but I cannot comment on the actual effects. I would have to use it for a long time to do so.:-) THANKS!"
Earth to Skin Super Fruit Citrus Day cream smells amazing! I love this lightweight day cream first is it very lightweight and goes on very smoothly. I love the citrus scent it is fun to use first thing in the am. I noticed fine lines were less noticeable within a week.
This cream starts off with a bang because of the lack of ingredients such as parabens and sulfates. The cream has a light and natural citrus smell that I love. It glides on smoothly and is quickly absorbed by my skin. I have combination skin and this cream did not make my skin oiler.I've used it twice daily for a week and my skin feels smoother and looks brighter. I'm impressed with this Day Cream that has natural ingredients and does not test on animals. I will definitely buy this especially after seeing its price!
I fell in LOVE with this cream. It was not too thick and did not dry tacky like I initially thought it would due to it being a gel formula. But it sank right into my skin and left it glowing. It got rid of a dry patch I had near my eyebrow within two uses. I liked the very light scent and the feel was incredible. I've been using it daily and my skin looks so much brighter without the use of cosmetics.
"The Earth to Skin Super Fruits Citrus Day Gel Cream with Hyaluronic Acid has a nice fresh smell that is not overpowering. If you are not used to using a gel-cream it takes a few days to get used to it. It takes a bit longer to dry and until it does your skin feels sticky. However, once it does dry your face will look and feel hydrated and radiant."
"I really liked using this product, as it made my skin super soft and it was gentle on my skin. The scent is one that would make me use it everyday because of how delicious it smells. After a week of using it I noticed my skin was glowing and didn't look blah anymore."
"Such a lightweight, gel like consistency. It adds moisture without making my skin oily. I love that it has hyaluronic acid too, which is great for skin. It seems to nourish my skin well. Not only that, but it has no parabens or sulfates, which is so much better for my skin. It's a natural day cream. I have semi sensitive skin and it is very gentle."
"The gel-like texture is really nice and does not feel heavy or pore-clogging when on your face, which is a big plus for any skin type. It smells fantastic, even though I do try to avoid fragrance in most of my skincare products. It did soften my skin, but I did not see the brightening or illuminating effects that it claimed to have. Still, it is good if you are looking for a natural skincare routine."
I absolutely love Earth to skin! It has a great scent and leaves your skin feeling so soft. You only need a very small amount. It goes a long way and this is a really great value. I also love that Earth to Skin doesn't test on animals! I would definitely recommend this to all my friends and family!
"My skin feels so soft and smooth after using this. I also feel that it made my skin look brighter and more radiant. It kept my skin feeling hydrated all day. It doesn't leave a residue and is very easy to apply. I really like the texture of it, as well."
The Earth to Skin Super Fruit Citrus Day Cream is an amazing product. When you apply it after your cleansed skin in the morning it glides on evenly and absorbs in your skin leaving it feeling fresh and supple. it leaves a fresh refreshing scent that is not too over whelming. It has no greasy feeling just right. I definitely recommend. really great product.
"The scent was my favorite part about this cream. When applied the gel texture felt heavy on my skin and never fully absorbed. This isn't a product for me, but it could be wonderful for someone else."
"My skin looks awesome now, it was dull and had dry patches. It is now smooth and soft and actually looks healthier now to be honest, I love this stuff."
This day cream left my face feeling smooth and brighter. It has a very pleasant smell that is not overpowering. I use this in the morning under my makeup.
I liked the light gel texture of the Earth to Skin Super Fruit Citrus Day Cream. If you put too much on it didn't absorb and got sticky. Also I would like it with spf better. My daughter also tried it and liked it.
This cream smelled good and made my face feel soft. I don't like to put heavy moisturizers on my face in the morning so this cream was perfect. It's lightweight and didn't clog my pores

"I do like it! However, I have other creams and washes that work just as well or better. It does have a nice scent, and I was happy to test it!"
It has done an incredible job calming my acne prone skin and it also has more naturally derived ingredients than other gel cleansers.
