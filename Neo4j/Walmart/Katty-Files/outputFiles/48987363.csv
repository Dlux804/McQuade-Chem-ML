"I thought I would try ""just another cream that claims to solve dryness and flaky skin"" I did and it works on myself like no other expensive creams I have tried in the past.I use to put on the creams and make up and have flaky skin. Now, this cream, makes makeup stay creamy on my face. Just love it. Now, I am anxious to try eye cream."
I got this because I needed a good moisturizer. I normally don't prefer the feel of creams but I really needed one. This one is light and comfortable. Smells good too!
"With the cold weather hitting New England, I decided I finally needed to start using moisturizer. I'm 50 and haven't used facial moisturizer before because my skin was always oily. Now, I know I should have been using moisturizer all along. I picked up Age Perfect Cell Renewal Night Cream and Age Perfect Cell Renewal Day Cream at CVS the other day. After one use, my skin was soothed, soft and the roughness is smoother. I can't believe how healthy my skin looks after just a few days."
It is still a new product that I am testing but so far so good.
Does make my skin softer where dry spots were a problem
I would therefore recommend this product.
"I recently bought this for my mom who is 47 years old and she loves it! After using it for just 2 nights, she was astonished at how tight and brighter her skin is. She is raving about this product to her friends and convinced them to try this product out. My mom's face is less wrinkly, but not only that but her face is more nourished and hydrated!

"The cream is thicker than most creams I used buy hey, it moisturizes my skin...The smell don't bother me either.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a fan of Age Perfect Glow Renewal for years. It perfected my skin. It made it glow, softened my facial lines, never made my eyes burn and lasted all day and when applied at night it lasted all night. The Hydra Nutrition product is stiff and sticky and my skin does not absorb it at all. Even tried using it on my feet and and it did nothing."
"I received a sample packet and tried this. My skin doesn't feel as dry and my foundation didn't ""roll-off"". I put a new product on one side of my face to test it so I can't tell if there is a difference yet - need a few weeks. My only complaint is the fragrance - L'Oreal you don't need it! My expensive products don't have it, get with it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first time I applied this cream, I used a different brand serum first then applied it. It didn't spread well or absorb, and I had flakes all over my face. So the next night I used my Loreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal serum first, and then applied the cream. The same thing happened. I could never use this as a Day cream. I will use the rest of the jar only at night and never purchase again."
"This is a great, simple product that's not greasy, overly bearing fragrant or heavy. As someone with combination and sensitive skin, this cream is a refreshing welcome to help keep things balanced with my complexion. After running in the outdoors under the sun for the past four years, my tight south Asian skin also needed some help. Perfect for all skin types and for those of us in our 40s."
"I bought this after trying so many other VERY expensive brands that promised quick results with none to see. I have used this for 3 weeks and I can see so much change in my skin. Firmness, dryness decrease, and age not showing on my skin as it used to. In my opinion this is the best skin nutritional cream I have ever tried. HEY! All other companies I want my money back. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is so perfumed that I cannot use it..tried two times...even my husband complained!
Smooth cream that feels light and non greasy. Excellent under a tinted foundation. Worth the money.
"I was use to the Glow Renewal Cream which was perfect for my skin type. Then it was discontinued. This product is sooo thick its hard to use. Then it dries sticky. Poor product. Need Glow Renewal ""CREAM"" back not oil!"
"At nearly 71 years old, I just love this cream. I can feel it working - greaseless, yet rich in product. I am so glad that I decided to give this a try!"
"I had a great out come from this cream. Happy that I was able to give it a try. Work wonderful in my skin. For the price I almost didn't want to try it but so, happy I did!! As a esthetician I could be very skeptical but it works better then other cream that claim better results to mature skin. I highly recommended."
I love this cream it leaves your skin so soft and wrinkles are less visible
Wonderful for older lady who prefers softer younger looking skin!
I can't use many products on my face I tend to break out so I used this on my upper chest and neck. I loved how softened my skin looked. Especially on my upper chest from all those years in the sun. It has a really nice fragrance. Affordably priced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the non-greasy texture and felt like it penetrated the skin but my goodness, the strong cheap perfume fragrance is just too much."
"I been buying this product from 3 months ago, don't plan on stopping either [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It feels like it's tightening, and it goes on smoothly, but it doesn't absorb all the way and feels like a mask when it dries."
I like this cream but I have to use another cream on top of it to mask the scent. It's a little strong
"I adore the "" age perfect "" line so i am going to buy as much as i can, im sure the night cream will be amazing , since i love all these products"
My skin is so dry and I couldn't find anything that helped! This is a miracle!!! My skin feels so soft and all my dry patches are gone!!!
I received this free to try. I love how smooth it makes my skin feel. Would recommend to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this product due to the thickness of the texture. I give myself a nice massage with this product. I even apply it to my neck, chest, and hands. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Even though I am still in my 30s my skin is terrible due to too much exposure to tanning. A friend suggested this cream, so I decided to try it. It works great my skin was no longer dry, but instead felt soft and moist. this product smells good too."
"We recently moved from humid Hawaii to the dry desert in Utah. I was concerned that my face would age quicker here. Luckily, I discovered L'Oreal's Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition and use it day and night. It leaves my skin very smooth and hydrated. No longer am I scared of Winter. Bring it on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Age-Perfect works wonderfully on my menopausal skin. It keeps my face moist without feeling greasy and sets a good base under my foundation. I love its creamy texture and thickness, which seems to really help weather-beaten aging skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very happy to discover the Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Day/Night Cream. I have noticed my skin looks softer and more hydrated. It is the perfect moisturizer to use at night. I wake to skin feeling moist and not dry. It is a good texture to wear under makeup during the day as well. This cream compares to the higher end products sold at the department stores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product has a lovely creamy texture and I was concerned that it might clog my pores. To my delight however I found my skin felt silky soft, lines were softened and the product is non-comedogenic. I am very happy with the results and will continue using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this product! As a more mature woman, I have noticed changes in the texture of my skin. This moisturizer greatly reduced the signs of aging and when worn under my foundation, created a much smoother appearance. Totally recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I turned 52 in January of this year, and as we know time marches on and unfortunately left those lovely little lines and crows feet across my face. I've been using the Hydra-Nutrition Eye Balm, Day-Night Cream, and Golden Balm for just over a month now and I'm completely impressed. The area around my eyes seems to appear brighter and the lines less noticeable. YEAH! I've purchased Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition products for my mother as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm hooked on this line of skin care products. They smell and feel amazing. My skin is looking so much better including fading age spots and evening out skin tone. I never was great at taking care of my skin but I will never go without this product note that I've tested it out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked this face cream, especially during these harsh, dry, winter months. The cream is rich and has a lovely texture and wonderful light fragrance. It is perfect for dry, mature skin. Noticeably hydrated skin after I applied morning and night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been wanting to buy this to give it a try and so glad that I did. No other product compares
Moisturizes and has helped control my oily skin. Very thick and smells great.
I bought this a month ago and it is a good product.
"I'm so glad that I found this. It's not sold in Walmart stores anymore and I really like this cream, and the price was really a bargain."
"This cream is nice, if feels good on my skin and makes my lines appear smoother. It's a bit thick, so it sometimes leaves flakes on my skin but otherwise pretty good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It has too much fragrance for my liking. I prefer the balm to this. I like that these jars do not have the extra secondary 'lid' inside, not sure if it is supposed to keep the cream fresh but they always end up with cream all over them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It works. I bought this cream because it said on the box ""ANTI-SAGGING"", I did NOT believe it. I figured it's not going to work and I will persuade myself to buy one of those expensive 5 minuted wrinkle removers as you see on TV. However, today is the second day I am using it and I see a noticeable improvement. btw, there was no difference on the first day of using it. Just wanted to share this info."
"I can't believe that after just 7 days my 49 year old skin looks better than when I was 30! My skin was dry no matter what I used. No longer, my face is silky smooth and the crows feet that I have were getting deeper. Now you can barely see tyhem. And what dark circles under my eyes? Those are gone too! After just one week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This Day/Night cream was easy to apply. It had a nice scent, but a little too strong for me. It didn't leave my face greasy like some other products I've used. The jar is really pretty so you can display it on your vanity. my skin feels very smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I want to tell you I have been using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Day/Night Cream for the past 10 days. I am so impressed with this product, the results I've already witnessed and how my face feels hydrated all day - not dry, dull and lifeless. The cream is so rich and creamy, you don't need to use very much to cover your face and neck area. I like how my face feels hydrated all day - even in freezing temperature weather. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It has been a good product so far. Looking to see what happens over time. Helps my skin tone. I need the moisture this provides. Looking forward to the future corrections this product will make. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely loved this product. The whole line makes my skin feel so fresh and clean. My skin is lighter and it completely cleared up my dry skin. I haven't been using it for very long YET, but I can see subtle differences in fine lines around my eyes. I can't wait to see the results in a couple more weeks. I have already recommended this product to friends and definitely plan to buy this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for a little over two weeks now. Pros: My face looks and feels much softer. Cons: Within the first few days of using it my face broke out. But to be fair, my face breaks out with any change to my regimen. Overall I will keep using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the cream primarily during the day. I feel the texture of the cream is very nice and spreads easily. I do find the smell a little offensive and got a few headaches while using it. I prefer the L'Oreal Golden Balm to this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this product for a week so far. It has a creamy texture and a pleasant smell. I thought it would be too greasy and heavy, but it smooths into your skin and doesn't leave a greasy feel at all. My face did breakout a bit, but I am not sure it that was the cream or not. It's too early to tell long term affects and I plan to continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This Day/Night cream is very luscious and smooth. It made my skin soft and lightened. The scent is very appealing, and not too strong. My face does not feel greasy, but does feel velvety. I will definitely use this everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have beem using the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Day/Night Cream for the past two weeks and what a difference it has made, my skin is smoother, more even, and absolutely radiant!!! My glow was absolutely perfect for my new years party and three of my friends commented on the absolute change in my skin! I told them its all thanks to the L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial cream!!!! Yayyyyy for my glowing skin!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This day and night cream is a great start and a great ending to my day. It feels silky smooth and is really easy to apply. Go great even under my makeup in the morning and doesn't leave me shiny. Has also improved the look and feel of my skin. Overall I love using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is great for older skin. It blends in well with my skin type. I applied it twice a day and just the way the container explained and it did great. Made my neck very soft and it has a great fragrance to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I Loved the Day/Night Cream. My Only issue is the fact it states non greesy? The Product itself did exactly as the package states...also love the packaging by the way but back to business. I did find it was a little heavy. Still a great product though ! Would I purchase. Yep , sure would and fully intend to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my favorite of the four products. The cream itself is not oily and is odor free. It has made my skin so much softer in only one week. Before using this cream, my skin around my nose and chin was so dry, now it almost feels like silk. I have not noticed any more firmness, just softer skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I would want to know what other think of said product and whether or not they would recommend it. I used this product for 10 days, the first thing I noticed was the pleasant light fragrance. When I began using the product on my face it absorbed wonderfully. Within a few days I noticed that my skin was much more hydrated without having an oily feeling . I would highly recommend this product to family and friends [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started out using this morning and night, but just decided to use it at night because it was a bit heavy to wear during the day. It does absorb quickly and wasn't too greasy, but it is a heavier cream which is better for me to wear at night more than the day. I have sensitive skin, so it was good that it didn't irritate it at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin hasn't felt this soft and subtle in years, I though since im turning 56 that i would just have to get used to icky skin, well not anymore! this has done wonders for my skin, no more dry feeling its so soft like a babies bottom :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have continued using the Day/Night cream since receiving it, and I like it. It leaves my skin with a soft, smooth feel and its not heavy, or oily feeling on my skin. Its taken me a while to get used to using it, as I don't usually wear make up and lotions but I feel that it is worth it in the long run. I will try and use the oil and other products more as well, but so far I really like this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE this moisturizer. My face felt smooth and silky, even at the end of the day, and I have dry skin at 44 years of age. I have tried several moisturizers that don't last through the day as well as this, so I am very happy to have tried it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the L'Oreal day and night cream works really well. Once I started using it, I could tell after a few days how well hydrated my skin was. I expected the cream to fill heavy or greasy and it was neither. It is lightly scented but not too much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My face feels so moisturized. I have really dry skin and allergies. I've noticed a difference that I don't mess with my eye area as much after applying. My allergies make me scratch. My skin doesn't itch. Liking this product as I'm getting older and should pay more attention to my wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Loved this product!! It felt so decadent and rich. I received my samples during a visit to MI during winter. My skin usually is very dry and drinks up any moisturzers I try, but this cream was so rich I instantly felt comfort!! Without being goopy and greasy. My makeup went on so nice and even and had fantastic staying power too!! Little goes a long way also!! Highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this cream! I wasn't sure it was supposed to be for both day and night. I wish the directions were a little better. Overall this cream smells great and comes in great packaging. It left my skin smooth and more even toned. It is thicker than some and I was worried about possible skin irritation and clogged pores but it's been fantastic! My skin feels healthier than ever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been trying the cream for more than a week, I feel very heavy and does not spread widely on the face, you have to apply enough to cover the whole face, I have not seen greater change I guess I have to wait longer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a great product. It makes my face soft and smooth, all day and night. I have used other brands, but none have kept my face feeling good. I like how thick, not runny or thin this is. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin feels amazingly soft after using for the last five days. My dry patches on my face are gone and it feels so much softer. I also love that it didn't make me break out as I have very sensitive skin. My skin also looks healthier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Is a light cream, so is really good to use it during the day. The fragance is good for someone around over 40, I dont thing the fragance is good for someone on the early 30s. It works really well! You feel your skin more firmer and softer. The size and packaging is perfect. I like the design. It would really help if it has like some reference about what ages should be using this cream. Because is not the same the skyn of a women around 40 than a women around 60. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am loving this cream! It has a nice light fragrance, so it doesn't overpower with a perfumey scent. It absorbs quickly and leaves your skin feeling smooth, not smothered. After 3 weeks of use I have definitely noticed a softening of some fine lines I had near my eyes. I'm hooked on this and will be trying the other products in this line for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So I think that Loreal age perfect has given us a great gift (to all women) I for one am very pleased with the day and night face cream,I love the smell, the way my skin feels after,seems like my wrinkles are not that noticeable. So I say that every women should feel beautiful and take care of herself and Loreal is helping us. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that the L'Oreal Paris age perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Day/Night cream is amazing.It leaves my skin feeling so smooth.I use it twice a day, morning and night I look forward to using it. The cream is smooth its self smells good and doesnt leave a oily after feel as other products do. I would highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Does a great job moisturizing, but when I used after a shower, then put foundation on, make-up streaked. Took a long time to absorb, better to use at night, so it will absorb and not interfere with make-up use. Only needed to use once a day. It leaves skin smooth and soft, not greasy. Smell is pleasant, a little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the smell of the Facial Day/Night Cream. I also loved how easy it was to apply and how moisturized it made my face feel. It never felt greasy or too oily as some other products have. And it kept my face looking radiant all day long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Anti-sagging Ultra-Nourishing Moisturizer left my skin feeling smooth and gave it a nice glow. The fragrance in the moisturizer was very strong. This line of product is geared for mature and very dry skin and maybe the reason for the strong fragrance. I'd prefer to see less fragrance and a more appealing color to the containers and bottles used for this particular line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Wow! Another great product that I just can't say enough about. Amazing smooth texture leaving your skin soft and shiny. The cream is light and goes on smooth, the smell is so light and not over powering. I highly recommend this product especially to woman with very dry skin such as myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think I have found the perfect product for my dry , getting older skin. The Winter months always seem to leave my skin dry and dull. From the first use I noticed a difference in how my skin felt. Soft, moist but not oily! After a week of use a colleague asked what I was using because my face looked so good!! The best!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved how smooth it made my skin feel. I recommend this product to my mother and she loves it also. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the scent. It was a little too powerful for me. Wish they made a scent free product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a great day and night cream for my aging skin. I was impressed by the swift and yet light complete coverage - a little product goes a lon ways. The package is also very informative and showed me how and where to apply the cream. The cream was soft and absorbed quickly, there was a light scent but it was pleasant. I noticed visible results after a few applications. I look forward to continued use and ongoing improvements. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think these are wonderful products. I have never used the oil and was somewhat unsure of using it but it really doesn't leave a oily feeling. My skin feels so soft after I use it, not a oily soft but a soft soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is perfect for the cold weather. It leaves my skin hydrated all day and doesn't turn my skin oily at the end of the day. It doesn't make my skin feel oily after makeup or a workout. It works great with the eye cream. The cream smells great too!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like how thick this cream feels, particularly as a night cream during the dry, frigid winter months. My skin feels moisturized, but not greasy. It absorbs quickly, but my skin still feels hydrated when I wake up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the way this day/night cream goes on. It is very smooth, however my skin is too oily for this cream. It left my skin a lot more oily than it needs to be and I had a shiny face all day. I may be able to use this more during the summer. I do feel that someone with the right skin type would really love this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was really thick. I felt like it took a long time to absorb so it would be best for very dry skin. I was worried about it contributing to acne since it sat on top of my skin for awhile. It does smell great though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have normal skin. It isn't dry, even though we are in a climate that has very dry winters. I used this for about a week, and it was just too thick for me. I actually broke out from using it. It smells lovely, my daughter actually complimented me on how great my skin smelled when using it! I gave the product to my mother, who has dry skin. She loves it! She said it leaves her skin soft and not itchy from dryness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the ease of using this product, but with naturally oiler skin, I felt that this cream actually enhanced oil production, it also didn't do anything for my dry winter patches. The scent is very strong as well. I will most likely not use this product in the future or recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am 49 and was beginning to feel like a 60 yr old, my face was dry and lacked moisture, well let me tell you I have been using this product for about a week and I can clearly see the difference, my face has a glow to it that wasnt there before, and it dosent feel as dry and tired as it used to look before, i am excited to see how my face will look in about 30 days, it is a little bit heavy but once applied it dosent feel heavy. I love love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this L'Oreal Paris age perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Day/Night Cream is worth trying. It is rich and creamy but not heavy. I have been using it for about a week now and I look forward to putting it on. It has a very light scent that does not bother my allergies. I also have a breakout issue with products and have NOT experienced any using this Day/ Night cream. My skin feel refreshed and young. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this product in corroboration with L'Oreal's Age Perfect golden balm, eye cream and facial oil, and loved it. I have been using these products for the last four days, my skin feels tighter and smother. I have very sensitive skin, most beauty products cause me rashes, not this, not even a single clogged pore. A great product over all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L""Oreal Paris day and night cream really works wonders. I've been using it for almost 3 weeks now and I feel young and. Radiant. My skin is so soft and don't look dull. It really brings the color and makes your face look like a million bucks. I would recommend L""Oreal Paris to everyone this stuff is wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cream is heavier so for daytime use it doesn't sit well if you put your make up on but is better for an evening cream. It has a nice light citrus smell and soaks into the skin nice without being greasy but is still a bit heavier for even daytime use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First off, I want to talk about the scent. It is perfect. Not overwhelming as many facial products. It is just a light blend that doesn't cause you to regret putting it on. Next, the feel of the cream is refreshing and not overly thick or greasy. L'Oreal has formulated a superior product based on these two aspects alone. But the cream is also a stand out and massively hydrating. I was very pleased with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Day/Night Cream is a truly great product. My skin looks healthier and more moisturized. I noticed a difference almost immediately in the way my face felt. It is smoother and softer. The product seems very thick in the jar, but goes on smoothly without looking or feeling greasy. It also has a really nice scent that isn't overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only used it a week and my skin is firmer and not droopy around my eyes. I look and feel younger. I can even go without makeup, which is usually, and the old scars are not as prominent s they were at first. They are getting better each time I use it. It is fantastic! It's well worth the time and money. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product! I will definitely be purchasing more when I finish this off. Very moisturizing, it feels great and smooths in very nicely and quickly! Doesn't leave you greasy feeling, makes my skin really soft and smooth, it looks more rejuvenated. Very simple for those who don't want to spend much time or effort, very easy to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm always hesitant to try face products, having sensitive skin that breaks out to most things with scent. This product, while having a fragrance, did not break me out! My skin is smoother, noticeably after 2 days and keeps getting better! It also evened out my dry/ oily confused skin so it's soft and smooth all over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin has become really dry after I turned the big 40! I also have a big issue with black circles under my eyes. In a quest for new products, I decided to to L'Oréal facial care line. I am so glad that I did!! The products are not greasy and don't have a noticeable smell. My face is hydrated, feels smother, and the black circles are less noticeable. I definitely recommend using these products and I will continue to use them myself!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The scent of the product is light and fresh. I love the smell of this product! Though the product smoothes across my skin very well. However, the product takes a while to absorb all the way into my skin because it sits there, then disappears. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"December 30,2016 < yhliking, After I have tryout all the products that I receive. This products has improved reduces the fine lines around my eyes and my skin feeling soft, smooth and refresh my eyes for brighter, firmer and youthful looking. I love this product.

What a difference a day makes!! I love this product I feel so refreshed in the morning and makes my skin so soft and supple.. I was looking for a product that actually softens fine lines on my face and this one has won me over.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
So I have been using the product for a week and so far this product is keeping my face moisturized and soft. The cream it's self is a little thick but smells good. The other brand I used before this one is not as thick but it made my face oily. This product does not. So far so good. I am enjoying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Another great L'Oreal product. My skin was so soft and smooth after using he facial day/night cream. With winter drying out your skin this will keep your skin moisturized. My skin is always dry this time of year, but not that's not a issue with this cream. I'll continue to use this until it's gone and definitely will purchase more after its gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just turned 40 and still have oily skin, so this cream was a little to heavy for me. I tolerated it at night, but it made my face look slick (not dewy) during the day. It was definitely not the effect I was going for, so I discontinued using after two days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm giving this 4 starts because the product was great. It made my skin feel wonderful. I have picky skin though and had to go back to my old stand by beauty routine because my skin wasn't agreeing with the product on my face. Now I am still using it on my neck and my skin looks amazing. I would recommend anyone to try this because it seems to be a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this cream when my face was very dry from the winter air. It has been fabulous. It has moisturized my skin without feeling greasy. It doesn't make my face itch at all. It was very easy to follow the directions and to put on. This will last a long time, because you only need a little bit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think I may be forming a habit. I have never used moisturizers and such because I usually end up red and blotchy. Since starting this a week ago I can feel a difference in my skin. I have sensitive skin and have had no poor reactions. Usually I get red and puffy even with just a moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have only been using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Facial Day/Night for a few days now and its great i love it!! my skin tends to be a little dry or im always in need of some extra moisture. It does contain oil and i am loveing useing it as i do have dry areas on my face and i can see some difference it goes on smoothly and smells Amazing!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Have been using a little over a week and I love it! The cream has a light clean smell with a hint of girlie. Seemed heavy on my skin for daytime but started only using at night and seems much better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Facial Day/Night Cream is simply put, fabulous! It is so easy to apply and light & airy. Having naturally oily skin on my face I was worried it add to the oils, bit it was the opposite!! Used with L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition products, it's become the first & last thing I do every day. My skin just glowes now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way this facial oil quickly absorbs and makes my skin glow. The sunscreen is an important benefit. I like not having to add an extra step in my morning routine. I apply this facial oil after cleansing my skin in the morning. My makeup goes on nice and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product! I have used it for one week and already see results. I use it every morning and evening after I cleanse my skin. My face and neck feel so soft. My skin even looks brighter and smoother. This day/night Cream has a rich texture without feeling greasy. I feel that it is a nice addition to my skin care routine. It definitely helps my dry dull winter skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am using the face cream at night and during the day. My face is feeling very soft and my lines around my mouth have softened. I enjoy the smell of the cream and was surprised that my face didn't break out. Usually any kind of face cream with a perfume odor makes my face break out. The only problem I have with the face cream is that it is slightly heavy for a day cream. It feels a little heavy on my face and does not blend well with anything I put over it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Facial Day/Night cream works just in few days! My friends still asking me what I have done to my face because my skin looks nice. There are NO more wrinkles on my forehead. My answer is ""Thanks to BzzAgent and L'Oreal because I have received this creams for free! So I can try it."" My friends ready to sign up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I also loved the Facial Day cream. I have such dry skin in the winter and this was a GREAT product to help with that. However I did not like the scent of this product (some could be because of my pregnancy as I get very sensitive to scents during it) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am amazed at how great this product is. I have had people tell me that I am glowing. And I know I owe it to this product. I have been using it for a little over a week. Can't wait to see the difference when I finished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product from L'Oréal is great. It really works. My face is softer and not as dry in only a week. I cannot wait to see how I will look and how my face will feel with continued use. The cream is light weight and a little goes a LONG way. I really am liking this product. Good job L'Oréal for a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Smetss great, hydrates well.it has a yellowish tone. I tried many facial moisturizers but this takes the cake it really moisturized I tried many facial moisturizers but this takes the cake it really moisturized and hydrated my skin. I have very dry skin. I used it right after I washed my face. Would defiantly recommend to moms in their 30s 40s. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do like the feeling of this product, and it is a thick cream that feels good going on the skin. However, I am very sensitive to fragrances, and this product really bothered my allergies. I wasn't able to use it more than a couple of days, so I can't give it a great review for that reason. I would encourage others who do not have this sensitivity to try the cream, because I think it would have worked well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this product. I have even discovered a new use for it. I put a couple drops on my palms and fingertips and run it through my hair, it helps tame the dry split ends and makes my hair smell fabulous. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very dry skin, especially this time of the year. After using this product I was so excited to find my face free of dried skin and it was so soft! Plus this cream smells really good as well. You don't need to use much of this product either to moisturize your face or neck! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is top notch! It goes on smooth and doesn't feel greasy. I apply at night after a shower and usually do not need to re apply in the morning. My face is still moisturized and smooth the following morning. My skin is extremely dry in some places and I still do not need to reapply. This is a wonderful product for dry skin or even patchy dry skin. Apply where needed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The day/night cream felt a big greasy, probably because I applied it after using the Age Perfect facial oil and the Age Perfect eye cream. Once all of the products absorbed my skin felt very soft. The product smelled really good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Let me start by saying I am not a skin care fanatic. I wash and moisturize. That's it. Until 2 days ago. I am on day 2 of using L'Oreal's Age Perfect Hyrda-Nutrition Facial Day/Night cream. My face feels AMAZING. All day and night hydration that is so good it's making me realize how dry my lips really are. This cream is working the moment it hits your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this moisturizer. I can both see and feel it working. My forehead has always been a trouble spot with dry, flaky skin . Since I have begun using this L'Oreal product, I have noticed less flaking and more smoothness to my skin. I will definitely be purchasing this and using it as part of my skin care regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's now winter and my skin always gets itchy and dry, especially around my mouth and chin.I have been using the L'Oreal day and night age perfect face cream, and I have seen a big change.My skin looks and feels so much better it's soft no dry patches.I loved this applying it after getting my eyebrows done great on sensitive skin.scent is mild and very nice.

"I'm normally not a fan of moisturizers. They usually leave my skin feeling oily or worse, sticky! But this cream was a pleasant surprise. And maybe it's my imagination but I think my wrinkles are less visible with just one use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"All indications are this cream would be super heavy as it provides a mega dose of oil and moisture to your skin but it's not! I almost didn't try it because it stated it was for ""mature"" skin but I'm glad I ignored that and gave it a shot. I'm only in my early 30s and still get breakouts. The cream proved to be light feeling on and absorbed quick. It makes an obvious difference to the feeling of my face. It's easy to use under makeup and at night. Don't hesitate to try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Trying this for the first time, I fell in love. It makes my face feel soft, smooth and has an amazing light clean scent. I use it at night before I go to bed, also put it on in morning after washing my face and before I put my makeup on. Although I am worried about a dry face, I do not like my face to be greasy after using a moisturizer, this doesnt leave that greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I only have it a 4 out of 5 because the smell of this one was the strongest. I have super dry skin and it helps seal moisture in. With this product I don't get the dry tight feeling like my face is going to crack off like I often do during the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the L'Oreal -Age Perfect Day and Night cream and I like the silky skin after I've applied it. Why use 2 different creams when u can have just one. The scent is very nice too! I've used it with make up and it also goes well. The cream felt a little thick but just massage it on your fingers and it applies well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is fabulous. I can see where it is helping hydrate my skin helping to slowdown the aging process of my skin. My face actually looks fresher. Also it feels good when applied not greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal facial oil. It had very little scent. The top is like a medicine dropper. You jusr squeeze and you are ready to apply. I didnt care for it as an oil. Although once put on the greasy feel disappears quickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product. It has a light fragrance which is lovely, yet it's not overpowering. It feels so buttery and absorbs in the skin easily, but it's not greasy, which I cannot stand. It did leave my skin noticeably softer and it stayed soft. I found myself touching my face for hours after putting it on and it was still soft to the touch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is great...packaging is very expensive looking. Once opened the cream is very luxurious,! Once placed around eye , I feel with continued use it would plump up my skin where crows feet are starting. Did not feel greasy . I will definitely be telling my ""mature"" friends to buy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how it feels on my under eyes and it make my skin feel rejuvenated. It's not too oily and it make my pores smaller and my skin feel ithgt. It also smells really good. Thank you for this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This day/night cream is a really great cream especially as a base cream under my foundation, as it makes my foundation go on smoother and takes less foundation as well...this cream is in no way greasy feeling because it absorbs quickly...the entire product line is just really awesome and I plan on purchasing when I run out...if you're reading my review then don't hesitate, go ahead and try!!!

"nice texture but does not seem to make much difference in the condition of my skin. though I am 64 yrs old my skin is not dry, in fact it is normal to oily. so this product may work for those whose skin is dry and mature just not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have very dry chapped skin and this product penetrated deep into my skin refreshing and making my skin feel soft . I could still feel the softness in my skin the next morning. The burn from my skin being chapped was gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is super rich and creamy and goes on smooth to your skin. Living in a cold climate I need all the moisture I can get on my skin! This product does not make my face feel greasy and has not clogged my pores. My only con is the smell. It is a bit too fragrant for my liking, but found that is goes away after awhile. Overall I will continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love love love the scent of this cream. My husband also mentioned how pretty it smells. It was very moisturizing. It was thick and creamy, but not too heavy for my daily activities. I used this product in my morning routines. I am usually make-up free and this cream enhanced that fresh look! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thanks to L'Oréal Paris & BzzAgent for sending me this free product to review! It was part of my nightly face cleansing routine. After cleansing my face I applied this as a moisturizer to my face, neck and chest areas. It is extremely rich with moisture. Normally during this time of year my nose area gets really dry and this has been able to keep this under control. I would definitely purchase this product on my own after I run out of this free product for review! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the same moisturizer for several years. After I tried the Day/Night cream, I don't think I will go back to my old one! It left my face feeling so much softer and more moisturized after only one use! My liquid foundation went on better and doesn't look flaky like it usually does. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Day/Night Cream is the BEST cream I have ever tried. I kept waiting for the feeling to go away, but the entire day I can feel it moisturizing my face. It keeps it from feeling dried and cracked. It helps it to feel smooth and silky throughout the day. I kept rubbing my cheeks and forehead beause I couldn't believe how good it felt on my face. I even got my husband to try it for the dryness on his face and he said it felt very good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ok, I must say I love L'Oreal, so much so that when I got these items I literally jumped for joy. I love this cream. Its moisturizing enough to use in the day or the night which is great. I prefer to use it in the morning before I apply my makeup because it helps with priming my face. It has precious oils, so if you have dry skin then this will be a miracle for you. I am so loving this line of products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A nice cream, but a little goes a long way and if you use too much it will feel just greasy and hard to rub all the way in. With the right amount applied skin feels nice and makeup goes on nice over it. I didn't notice much of a difference looking at my skin after 2 weeks though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
use this everyday and night. Makes my face soft and moist. love using this cream by L'Oreal at night. It makes my skin feel very smooth and doesn't get oily on me. It's a great product and I know for sure that I'm going to use it for a very long time--maybe forever!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Paris Day/Night Cream had a nice light scent. You only need a small amount to cover whole face. When I used before I went to bed the first time the next morning left face feeling greasy but when used after that didn't experience that again. It is also a great moisturizer. I have tried numerous products for dry skin and have not lasted. I love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was a little hesitant in trying the product but once I did I noticed a difference right away. After weight loss I have skin sagging on my neck. Now Its tightening up after using it just a few days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Best product i have ever tried loreal is an awesome brand makes your skin so silky soft fill of moisture and helps with puffy eyes and dark circles .Havent tried the sunscreen yet button i no it will be as great as the moisturizer cream for your face and chest.

"This was a good cream. I wore it both before bed and during the day. My face was not oily in the morning after wearing the cream all night. It made a good base to go under my makeup during the day. Feels a little heavy going on, but does not feel greasy on your face. I didn't give 5 stars because it does have a cosmetic type smell to it that I don't prefer. I would rather it had no scent. Other than that it is a good moisturizer. I don't think it is pore clogging. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great product. I have never used anything on my face at night before bed besides regular lotion. The Loreal Age Perfect is amazing. My skin really did feel rejuvenated the next morning, not sticky or wet, but hydrated and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the cream for several days now. I can tell it has already made a difference in the fine lines and wrinkles. It goes on smooth and isn't greasy. { love the product and will continue to us it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
With winter weather raging outside and heat running constantly inside the moisture has been sucked from my skin leaving it dry and itchy. L'Oreal Hydra-Nutrition has been a blessing with giving me the moisture back. It is very light going on and not greasy feeling. It has a light pleasant sent. I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product! When you apply it, in absorbs nicely into the skin without any greasy feeling. It is very lightly scented with a pleasant fragrance. I could tell a difference in the appearance of my forehead wrinkles almost immediately! It really does help with the appearance of lines and wrinkles, but I also love the fact that I can use this product for both day and night. Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the consistency of this product and it goes on smooth and hydrates well. My skin feels so smooth. I am not a fan of fragrance in my lotions so I would definitely continue to use this product if it was fragrance free. Great for dry skin but not if you are sensitive to smell.

"This was my favorite product the loreal paris age perfect hydra-nutrition facial oil spf 30, just a little and it worked magic. I loved the peppermint like fragrance, and the way it made my skin feel. Would purchase for sure, it didn't make my skin feel overly oily like I thought it would.

This product makes your face feel smooth and soft and hydrated. I love the smell of this. Just leaves your skin feeling incredible. Just make sure your face is dry before applying otherwise you get a greasy feel. Because of that it loses a star. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have horribly dry skin on my face especially in the winter. I have never been able to find anything that would keep my face hydrated all day and night. This product is a life saver! A little goes a long way so you only have to use a small amount to get the desired results. L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Day/Night cream definitely lives up to the name! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am usually a skeptic of beauty products and their true ability to get results but I am going into this L'Oréal campaign hopeful! After using it for only a week I can say I feel the softness each time I apply the cream and the smell isn't a turn off! As for results, I haven't seen any difference in visual appearance...Fingers Crossed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this product. I have combination skin and in the winter it feels a bit dryer. I can see a noticeable difference in my skin while using this product - it is so much softer. Because I have combination and because it is not listed as non-comedogenic I will probably limit its use to the winter months and then pass it on. It has a very mild fragrance which I can tolerate easily. If you have very dry or mature skin, I think this product is for you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Day/Night Cream. It feels rich and creamy. It goes on very smoothly leaving a Natural Glow. I use this with the other 3 L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I would go out and buy this cream it is honestly one of the best I've tried out and I've tried out quite of few but I think I found a true match for me. I think this product is great! Since I began using it about a week and a half and I and others have noticed a glowing smoother skin. I like the pleasant smell and it's silky texture. It's very light doesn't feel like I even put it on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The day/night cream works well as a moisturizer both in the morning and at night. I prefer to use it in the morning as absorbs pretty quickly. If you have slightly oily skin this should still be okay (I have oily areas) and I didn't have any issues. This cream helped with not only my dry areas but my blotchy areas improved. If you have really oily skin, it might be too much moisturizer, it is best for those with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using it the first night so it has been 5 nights and my skin feels so refreshed and I can feel the difference every morning. When I look in the mirror I see a clear and clean face and neck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin has changed so much now that I have hit my 40's. It had become dull and very dry. Exposure to cold and dry air hadn't helped. After trying this moisturizer my face feels and looks normal again. It has helped bring back my suppleness and brightness. It is a very lightweight moisturizer but dont be fooled the surge of moisture you get is amazing! I Highly recommend this moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
this cream is wonderful really felt my skin becoming tighter renewed feeling when used at nighttime .. i would suggest this product this to any women . A little amount goes along way for sure . bang for the buck !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The day/night cream was ok. I'm not a fan of the smell. It's too perfumey (not a real word). When I wash my face before bed I don't want to necessarily put on a cream that has a sent to it. If you want a light and airy moisturizer for overnight, this is a good product. Just keep in mind it has a perfume smell and may aggravate your allergies.

"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Day/Night cream left my face feeling smooth and soft. It has a light, pleasant scent and absorbs into my skin within minutes with no greasy residue.

"I deals with dry skin around my nose area. But after using the L'Oreal Paris Anti-Sagging Ultra-Nourishing Moisturizing Day/Night cream, my face feels great!

This cream hydrates very well. My skin gets very dry in the winter and this moisturizers just enough. It doesn't get greasy. I just use very little as it goes a long way but has worked in preventing my skin from getting flakey in the winter. It absorbs quickly and I'm able to apply makeup right over without feeling oily.

The oils and minerals in L'Oreals age perfect hydra-nutrition day/night cream are so refreshing look at the packaging!!

Happy skin happy me . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I will definitely be purchasing this again! This cream is very thick, covers well, and moisturizes amazingly! A little bit of the cream goes a long way and it has a very slight pleasant smell to it. Your skin feels very soft, even after sleeping all night! I have started using it in both the morning and night for super soft skin. It doesn't have an oily feel that some other creams have and make up goes on well over it. I have sensitive skin and it has been great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
What a great idea! For years I have used both a day and night cream. That is until now. I live using one product for both day and night. This moisturizer is light enough to go under makeup and rich enough to wear at night. It absorbs quickly into the skin and worked great under my foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product so far is amazing.. the packaging instructions were easy to understand. I used it right out of the shower and it seemed to use the shower moisture to add to the already moisture it brings.. my face doesn't appear to be oily and feels heathy.

"I recently received my L'Oreal facial kit and I felt so special opening it! The gold and white boxes were so feminine, it was a gift to myself! I love, love, love that the fragrance is suttle and clean smelling. The cream is also very light weight and made my skin feel soft and smooth. I'm very excited to pamper my skin each morning and evening! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the density of this face cream - it has a very luxurious feel while applying. Absorbs quickly and helps makeup apply smoother. My skin definitely felt smoother, softer and plumper after using. Only thing I did not love was the fragrance, it was stronger and lingered longer than other products I usually use. But it was not strong enough for me to discontinue use. I will definitely keep using, especially under makeup when I am feeling extra dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I'm not a fan of putting anything on my face before bed, but I was pleasantly surprised by this product. It felt light, and very breathable. In fact, I actually forgot I had put it on. I've used it for two days now and I feel like my face looks brighter and less tired. And with a teething toddler, I am not getting much rest. I wake up in the morning and wash my face, feeling like each morning my face seems to have a bit more youthful glow to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It doesn't take much. If you use just a little too much you have a greasy feeling. It does absorb well but it isn't something I would want to put on and leave the house right away and you don't want to use in combination with the other products because you have a greasy feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Before starting to use this every morning my skin was extremely dry and flaky, probably in part due to the cold winter weather here in the north. I began using this every morning after washing my face and my face has never felt better. There is no more dry flaky skin, only smooth fresh looking skin. I have sensitive skin and used a few other brands before which seemed to only make my skin worse but this product has worked wonders for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This moisturizer is great. I was a bit concerned because the second ingredient is mineral oil, which can clog your pores. Fortunately, this is not the case. It's very moisurizing and has a light, pleasant scent. It's a bit heavy, but melts into my skin fairly quickly. The packaging is attractive, in a heavy glass jar. A little goes a long way.

"I started using L'Oréal's Day/Night cream in late December when my skin was so dry, no moisturizer seemed to help. This really did the trick and gave my skin a nice glow.

I was reluctant to try the Facial oil at first thinking it would be to slick and my makeup would slide off...but i must admit I LOVE IT! The Facial oil is lightweight and completely absorbed in my skin almost immediately. My skin felt smooth and clean. I live in Florida and with an spf of 30 i am in love!

"I like this day/night cream because it helps with the dryness issue I have during the fall/winter months. The dryness of my skin has significantly reduced. My skin looks softer since I started using it. However, I gave it four stars out of five because it's not easily absorbed and feels like greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have always used generic lotions in the past but L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect products changed all that. You know how they say their is no difference between generic and the real thing. You are never too young or old to learn something new. L'Oreal Paris is an A+ product, my face and eyes have never felt brighter, softer and it has only been a few days. You will not regret using L'Oreal Paris products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

My skin felt firmer, and there was less dry spots which I frequently experience in the winter months. A step above and beyond as far as anti aging products go. Two thumbs up L'oreal you are amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the smell of this cream, and it's light buttery texture. My skin feels hydrated and soft after every application, it's perfect for winter skin care. I'm excited to try the rest of the products, after sampling the face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am now doing my routine a little different than before i wasn't doing anything going to bed without wash ny makeup off and not moisturize at all because I thought I didn't need to until recently ive notice that im getting older and aging so now my routine is using this moisturizer and glowing feeling really good about my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This stuff!! Yes please!! Ok, I'm really one that needs instant gratification and I totally got it with this product. It was so smooth, it wasn't greasy, and my skin felt so soft the next day. It made me want to keep my skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This stuff is amazing. Smooth and creamy.Upon using it a few days though it does have a hint of fragrance. Enough so that people around me asked if i had lotion on?Almost like perfume scent. It rubs in smooth and creamy and has a hint of color,that fades. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this cream for 5 days/nights. My skin typically gets very dry in the winter, but I have noticed a marked difference since using this cream. My skin looks healthier, feels better and I love the smell! I would definitely recommend for anyone who needs a little extra hydration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Day/night Cream, I would especially buy on my shopping list all the time.My skin is soft and not dry and i feel it nourishes my skin and improves it day and night bringing back my youthful skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I found this product to be very hydrating, it left my face feeling greasy and sticky. I don't feel this product would be good as a base for makeup but, possibly, if it soaks in enough over night, my skin will feel soft and smooth and the greasy sticky feeling I have now will be worth it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a very rich bodied cream as a great nighttime option. I used a much lighter layer for daytime use. It does have a strong fragrance...much more than I noticed with the balm and eye cream which is why I gave it 4 stars. So far my skin feels silky & generously moisturized after onky 24 hours. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was hesitant at first with this being labeled for mature skin and envisioned someone in their 80s smearing layers of this on, but I was pleasantly surprised. I use retin-A and it is drying and can cause peeling, and my skin just soaked this up! It's only been a few days but I haven't noticed my skin being abnormally oily at the end of the day or any breakouts. So far I am very impressed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is beautifully packaged and the jars are chic and sleek. The product smells great too! I immediately tried this product and was pleased that it wasn't greasy and smelled pleasant. I can't wait to see the lasting impacts from daily use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am 42 years old and I loved this product. I didn't think that I would like it since it's for mature skin, so I thought. From the moment I put it on, I felt the moisturizing. I live in Florida and even though it's not that cold during the winter, my skin was feeling kind of tight. This helped make it feel smooth and hydrated. Loved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. It moisturizes with out feeling heavy or greasy. It did not make my skin break out. I noticed a difference in the way my skin felt after using it. I would recomend this to anyone who struggles with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"L'Oréal day and night cream is wonderful l, immediately after putting cream on face and neck you can feel the moisture lock in. I plan on continuing to use this product the rest of my life to keep me skin moistened and younger looking! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that this product works really well. It's not very greasy and oily, and has a pleasant smell. Right away I noticed how moisturized my skin felt & looked. After a few days I did notice much more firm skin. So far, so good. I will purchase this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked it so far, it has a nice light, refreshing scent and its not greasy or oily feeling. I will definitely keep using it morning and night and see what happens. I have been window shopping for a similar crème and wasn't sure what to try, so I was really happy to get this one!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cream is non greasy it goes on real easy ,my skin is smooth and glowing radiantly, the cream smells fresh and revitalizing its like I just washed my face and still have moisture in my skin it is fabulous. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked the way the oil felt on my face but the fragrance was very strong. I was also happy with that it's Broad spectrum SPF 30. My skin felt very smooth. I didn't notice a change in appearance. I think I would definitely like this product more if it had a milder smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I love the consistency of this lotion, it is smooth and does not feel heavy on my skin. I have rather sensitive skin and I do not notice any reaction with use of this product. The odor is pleasant and I would definitely be a fan if it did not contain Parabens. I am a label reader, and the list of ingredients in this is rather daunting. Would be perfect if it weren't for several ingredients that I try to avoid, Parabens being the biggest. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is perfect to moisturize before bed, i can attest that my skin when I woke up felt very smooth and silky, did not leave it oily and your face looks very shiny. I highly recommend this to anyone who moisturizes on a regular basis for any skin type [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved using this product first thing in the morning , after cleansing my face. I loved using this product last thing in the evening, after cleansing my face. It not a lotion or a cream. It's a balm.... What makes this texture so nice to use is that it isn't oily or greasy on the face and neck area. It melts into your skin. My skin feels so smooth after application. My complexion has a nice glow. Love it !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just received my buzz box today.. So tonight I'm using it for the first time I'm in love with it already my face hasn't feel this good in a while.. I will be recommending this to my mom and cousins.. I will keep everyone updated.. I'm going to try it in the morning and then tomorrow night.. I'll post again then [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

So call me crazy but the best-kept secrets are non-conventional uses of beauty products. This is definitely one of them! After suffering from severely dry skin on the top of my foot I tried the day and night cream it's the only thing that's worked so far for my dry skin on that area ! What a difference in minutes ! Hurry winter is here you need this !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"With the weather so cold in New England, clearly our heat is making a muck of our skin. I tried this product last night and my dry flaky nose was smooth and soft! I immediately saw results but as of this morning my dry skin was back, though not as bad but I did see results. I will continue to use daily and report back with an update. Day 2 after application the dry skin is gone again. My skin feels soft and does not feel plugged with gross oil. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product! After several weeks of regular use, my skin looks and feels nourished and healthy. This luxuriously rich cream has given me soft, silky smooth skin and an overall glow. Works better than more expensive department store brands I have tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Another great product from L'Oreal! I was asked to try this and am so happy with it. My skin is so much softer and not so dull looking. I've only been using it less than two months, and I've had a few people ask me what I was using. I will continue to use this product. Thank you for asking me to try it! It's priced very reasonably, also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I loved the luxurious feel and scent of this day/night cream, I found it to be too moisturizing for day use. If I used it during the day, my skin was oily and looked sweaty. I opted to use this one nights when I didn't have dry patches on my face or hands. It's perfect for your hands too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Day/Night Cream has become my favorite moisturizer. Menopause has me constantly trying to figure out what to do next about issues like acne breakouts, super dry areas, large pores, and thinning crêpe skin areas. After I started using this product, most of these issues are ancient history. My skin really feels and looks much better. I get so many compliments that I look youthful and glowing. That is proof enough for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great cream for day and night use. Feels fabulous going on and seems to have made quite an improvement in my forehead lines. The only negative is the smell, a bit old lady'ish. I prefer fragrance-free products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the product day and night. I live in Southern California and my skin benefited from the rich moisture. I needed to use an added sunscreen in the day& for me that was a drawback. It made my skin feel very soft. It made my skin feel smoother [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oréal Age Perfect Day Cream is a keeper! I was pleasantly surprised by the rich buttery soft texture which makes my skin feel velvety smooth. I have been using the cream for 30 days and I think it re-toned my skin. It looks brighter and it just takes care of my skin all day long. During the winter months I suffer from very dry and redness prone skin but the cream balances the moisture level and my redness is not as severe. Loved it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Rich, creamy moisturizing product which is very good for my dry, mature skin! Quite thick but glides on smoothly without tugging at my skin. I would have preferred it to have no scent but luckily, the slight fragrance did not make my sensitive skin react badly. This was given as a free sample but I would purchase if it runs out."
I have been using this product for 3 weeks now and the result is amazing. I feel the long lasting glow from the inside and looking youthful from the outside. Recommendable product for a younger looking skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream is really thick. At night it's great--helps my skin stay hydrated and looking fresh. During the day...it's a little bit too thick for me. I like a little bit lighter feel to my moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product! it feels great going on, smooth and very moisturizing. You don't need a lot, a little goes a long way. I feel that my skin is more moisturized than with the other products I have used. A lifesaver in cold Wisconsin winters! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a new favorite! Rich moisturizing cream, it keeps my skin soft and helps to smooth out the fine lines on my face, neck, and chest. There is no ""sticky"" residue feeling left on my skin that I sometimes got from using other products of this type and the best part is my skin looks healthy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Day/Night Cream did not impress me. It has a heavy, muddy feel beneath my finger tips, as if it were resisting being rubbed over my skin. I tried this product for several days, because if it worked well for my skin the consistency and feel would not be a deal breaker. I could not see or feel any appreciable difference in my skin quality. It did an adequate job hydrating my skin, no more, no less. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So impressed with this line of products. This is a quality moisturizer that penetrates the skin barrier and effectively moisturizes dry skin. Moisturized skin is huge in helping to combat aging. It has an elegant consistency and rivals any high end product. Love it and the price ! Only complaint is I would like to see it come in a tube versus open cap jar container. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was a nice cream, however, it was very thick. I found that after a couple of uses I needed to leave my skin damp for it to go on smoothly. If I didn't to that, it wouldn't absorb very well. My skin felt very soft with continued use. One thing I didn't like is that when I put on my foundation (BB Cream) over it, it seemed to flake around my eyes. Also, if it's to be used as a day cream, shouldn't it have sunscreen? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My new favourite Day / Night Cream! I've been using this product exclusively at night for about one month. It's a thick, luxurious cream but not greasy. I use it on face, neck, and upper chest area for maximum effect. My skin feels firmer and supple. My extremely dry neck are feels so much softer and moisturized. I've found as my skin becomes more moisturized, that I do not need to apply as much cream for the best results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was given this product to use in return for an honest review. I have always used Olay products. This cream really impressed me with the way it moisturized my skin. I have normal skin but can be dry in certain areas. It went on great and felt great on my skin. Very impressed with the results. It did not cause any breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this as a day cream and have found it to be excellent over the past five weeks that I have been using. It sinks into the skin leaving the skin soft and supple. It is great under makeup. I recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this cream along with the Golden Balm and I really liked how they made my skin feel very moisturized all day long. Additionally, my skin appears to be a bit brighter since I've been using these creams. And they smell really nice -- even my boyfriend noticed! However, I did not notice any difference in my wrinkles, unfortunately. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I live in Southern California and it's very dry here, so I have always used a moisturizer. I am very happy with Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition. It is a little heavier than the cream I was using, and it is a better moisturizer. It smoothes easily into my skin, and it smells great, fresh and clean. I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have had dry skin my entire life. Now that I'm 53 I notice that my skin requires intense hydration. This is the cream for you if your needs are the same. My skin not only appears more supple - it actually is! It beats the previous Age Perfect cream I was using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have extremely dry skin and have been looking for a moisturizer that actually works for years. I was so impressed with L'Oreal Age Perfect Day/Night Cream. The new buttery consistency didn't feel greasy at all and my skin has not felt dry since the first day I started using it. I also really appreciate a company that produces good products for middle age women. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this moisturizer for about 4 weeks now and I really like it. It is a nice creamy weight for my normal skin and absorbs without feeling greasy. My makeup is going on smoother and staying on longer. It has a nice light smell that is very pleasant. My husband even noticed and thought it was a new perfume. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I went to a party for my son, where I saw friends that I have not seen for 13 years and two of them asked - what are doing - you look exactly the same, you haven't changed one bit? I have to attribute it to the Age Perfect Day/Night Cream. That's what was different...and what a great endorsement for the way it helps nourish my skin. I think it plumps out the skin so I thought my face looked 'fatter' but apparently others did not think so...I'm pleased. Go for it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very dry skin especially in the winter and when I apply this moisturizer, I can feel my skin taking it in like a sponge. After using it for several weeks, my skin feels smoother and softer. It works very well under makeup too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this day/night cream. It has a light and creamy texture and a lovely light scent. Highly moisturizing without a hint of greasiness. My fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeble and my skin feels great all day. I love it! I would definitely buy this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked this cream, it was a little bit greasier than what I was used too. I do not use foundation, just cream blush....and this cream made my blush just glide on. Overall it was a good moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This daily moisturizer is so thick I was afraid it would cause a breakout, now that my skin is thinner, it just felt rich and luxurious. I love the smell and it is creamier so it doesn't tug on application. My skin is soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Have been using this for about two weeks. My skin is softer and smoother. This product keeps my face moisturized all day! Pleasant smell and texture. The pores on my nose also seem to be less noticeable. Love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product to review via Vibrant Nation. After using it for several weeks I noticed my skin felt more supple. I'm in my 50's and have normal skin - neither dry nor oily - and the balm seemed to just sit on my skin without being absorbed. It felt a little weird on it's own but made for a good base for makeup primer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like how this product does not contain a SPF – I don't always want that ingredient in the product that I'm using. The product is a little too rich for my skin for daytime use. It made my skin feel a little too dewy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have very dry skin and I need lots of hydration, especially during the winter months. After using Hydra-Nutrition Day/Night Cream for several weeks, I've noticed that my skin is firmer and I don't have dryness or flaking. As I age, I need a moisturizer made for mature skin that deeply hydrates and this one does the job and then some. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This Age Perfect cream makes my skin feel younger. It adds much needed moisture to my dry aging skin. I really feel that I look younger from using it. It provides a nice moisture that last throughout the day. It has a nice thick consistency that absorbs nicely into my skin and doesn't feel heavy. I feel like it lifts my skin when I put it on. I use it every morning and at night before bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is awesome. The first 5 days I saw an improvement In my skin texture. My skin was very moist and dewey. Within two weeks my neck and chest had fewer line. Another plus was it didn't affect my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I live in the Sonoran Desert where the weather is sunny and dry and not good for skin. I have used this cream for a month now and notice a big difference in my skin. It feels soft and supple. Being a thick cream, it goes on smooth and disappears quickly leaving a moist barrier from the sun. I will definitely continue using this cream!"
"This cream has an elegant feel and leaves a subtle golden sheen on the skin. My skin is a bit dry, but I found this product to be too oily feeling for me, and the scent is too strong. I prefer to use it at night on my neck and face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product, it feels great going on, not greasy, yet very moisturizing and the light fragrance is nice. You don't need a lot, a little goes a long way. My skin is more radiant and definitely more moisturized than with the other products I have used. I will continue to use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Skin felt so smooth and supple and retained the moisture all day without feeling heavy. I felt like the texture of my skin improved with the coordination of the day cream. night cream and eye balm combination. While improving the elasticity of my skin it also feels comfortable and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am a longtime user of L'Oréal creams, and Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Day/Night Cream is one of my favorite products. I use it every morning. It is easy to apply and soaks into my skin quickly. It has a luxurious feel and leaves my skin silky to the touch. I have to wait very little time after applying it before I can put my foundation on, which is a big plus. I would definitely recommend this day cream to my friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried so many skin care products for my very dry skin. I am 56 and my skin has been so dry it burns and hurts throughout the day. The Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition for mature VERY DRY SKIN has been the answer. My face drinks it up. My face is comfortable and looks healthy. I do not notice the fragrance people describe in other reviews at all. I love this product.
"i am only 34, but years of unneccesary stress has made my skin sag abit . Heavy eyelids, and drooping jawline,but i have always scrubbed, moisturised my face and i dont smoke or drink. I noticed, that it's looking older now, so i decided to try Age perfect. ,It has made my skin look smoother, and it fills out finer lines around my face. I dont expect a miracle, but it is SO worth the money!! so if you're like me, still in your 30's and looking older before your time, try it!! smells good too :)"
"I purchased this product to give my skin more moisture and a firmer feel and that is exactly what I got! The bonus was the fragrance. I would love it if L""Oreal could capture this fragrance in a body wash I could use in the shower. The asking price for this product is ideal."
"Love the weight of this. Also appreciate that it does NOT have SPF as my sensitive skin ""rebels"" at that additive. Would have considered this as permanent replacement for my usual more expensive department store line. But the added fragrance is a deal breaker. Overpowering. And for those of us with sensitive skin, it is an irritant. Don't understand the value of adding it in to this product."
"I bought this cream for the first time. Previously I used the Day cream. This is more like a butter or balm. It does the trick, but I regret not researching before purchasing. I read the complete packaging only after purchasing. This does not state that the cream is non-comedogenic (I typically will not use unless it is), and it also does not contain SPF. Disappointed, but can only blame myself!"
"I have battled very dry skin for years. I work at a luxury retail store and have tried everything. I finally found one that works, but it is very costly. I saw this L'Oreal product advertized in a monthly fashion magazine, and thought I would give it a try. I love it! My skin does not have that tight dry feeling, and I look dewy and fresh. I use it morning and night. I love the price, too."
"I have been hooked on the ""Age Perfect"" line of moisturizers for quite a while mostly using the ""Pro-Calcium"" Then I discovered the new ""Hydra Nutrition"" and WOW!....my skin feels like silk and so youthful. I was so surprised when a couple of my friends commented on how great my skin looked and I have recommended this product to so many now. I even have my husband using it at night. So thank you, thank you for a wonderful product. Keep up the good work. Rivals any department store product!"
"I use the entire age perfect line and have for about a year now. The introduction of Hydr-Nutiton Moistuizer really excited me, and I have been using it for about 3 weeks now. I am very pleased with the results, and I truly believe that this product is better than SkinCeuticals A.G.E. Interrupter. Your product provides for more moisture than A.G.E. does, and it has great firming benefits."
"I have used L'Oreal Age Pefect Skincare for over one year. I love all of the products, especailly the Age Perfect Re-Cushioning Serum and the Age Perfect Eye Cream. This new Ultra-Nutrition Cream is fabulous for very dry skin! I live in CA - my skin feels drier in the winter months. This cream is very rich and emollient, and it feels wonderful! It has no SPF, so I use it a.m. and p.m., over the Age Perfect Re-Cushioning Serum - on my face and neck. GREAT for very dry skin!"
I bought last month. I am happy and grateful to the L'OREAL company.
Thicker volume than most facial creams so doesn't feel cold when applying...I love it!
"It is a wonderful moisturizer, for older skin. Have used it for over a year. Love it."

"The only con i would have with this cream is it is a little harder to absorb into the skin as other products; it is quite thick, and takes a bit more application to apply to face"

The hydra nutrition day/night cream made my skin look more vibrant and supple. I used it under my makeup in the morning and moisturizer at night after removing makeup. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This makes your skin so smooth although I had to switch to just using this at night along with Hydra Nutrition Golden Balm. It was a little too heavy to use for day wear under makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I LOVE this product. My skin seems to suck it in like a sponge, so I know I'm getting the moisturizing qualities I need. It works very well with or without makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love it ! Just wish it was unscientific. I'm very sensitive to perfumed things. Need unscented products please! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the moisturizing effect, but cannot stand the smell. I wheeze for the first hour after applying. All skin products should be available in a scent-fee packaging."
"I love the way this product causes my skin to feel but the scent is way too strong for a night cream. Many women, as they age, have problems with perfumed creams. I'd love to see a L'Oreal unscented line of products for 'Age Perfect' users."
"This is the most wonderful moisturixer I have ever used! The only one that actually works! My skin is soft, and much firmer. Really nice, especially for Winter. I just tried it about a week ago and I am sticking with it!!!"
"Luxury Therapy to the max! The texture and aroma therapy melts the day's stresses all away and gives me the strength to face Monday's! Needless to say, Love!"
I've tried so many. This one I purchased last week and already see a change in my skin. I'm excited about this product. Now more for the eyes and lips! Thanks for this product.
"This cream has given my face a new glow! :-) The skin on my face It used to be dried like raisin, bow it looks younger and fully replenished with a new glow."
Very moisturizing. Day/Night cream but couldn't tell if it had any sunscreen in it. Didn't notice any anti-sagging benefits but absorption was the best I've seen with any of the new Age Perfect products I have tried. Again the scent was a bit strong but the moisturizers are top of the line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this product quite regularly for 30 days. I just can't get on board with it. I found it very thick to apply and always felt like I had a mask on over my skin. The real thing I couldn't tolerate was the perfume scent. I like skin care products that are odorless or have a slight fresh scent to them. I would not purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have tried Hydra-Nutrition Moisturizer and would not buy again after realizing the ingredients in this product is also absbored into my body. Not thrilled with the amount of dyes, parabens, an a long list of ingredients that sound scary. I am opting to go with a more natural type of product."

skin feels tighter after applying Age Perfect. I have applied with damp wash cloth but don't know if that is the correct way.
