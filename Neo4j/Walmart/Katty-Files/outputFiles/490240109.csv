"I have had many face mist but at high-end department stores and this one leaves me really refreshed. I have had issues that some leave you sticky. After I started using Garnier SkinActive, I have never felt sticky or residue on my face. After I come back from the gym or even shopping I apply to freshen up before taking a shower. Another way that I use it is by taking it with me. If it comes in a smaller side I would definitely purchase for my purse. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"The mist is definitely Hydrating and does feel refreshing. But I tend to not like the way pump sprays leave mustard on my face, I don't feel an even coverage, I prefer misting sprays for that. So I found this to feel much better when sprayed on a cotton pad or facial wipe for that extra fresh feeling. Which it absolutely did leave me with.

"As others have said, smells great, but it's more like a spray than a mist. They need to improve the design of the bottle so that it spays like a mist rather than a spray. Some of my makeup started to drip off because too much of the product sprays out at once. If the bottle design was changed, this should improve the product."

I spray it at night and under my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice free from PINCHme. The mist comes out very fine and it takes quite a few pumps to cover the face.

I did try for the very first time the Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist . I didn't see a difference in my face.My face still felt very dry. It almost felt almost like a wax on my face...

"I love this product! Garnier leaves my face feeling refreshed and moisturized with a very light scent. I have also replaced my setting spray with Garnier Aloe mist. I live in Arizona so, my face needs moisture very frequently and, I find this product gives me exactly that. I can also spray it throughout the day for a refreshing feeling without it affecting my makeup. I would recommend this product for all skin types! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received a full size sample of Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice from Pinchme.com. This is the first time that I use a facial mist. I Love it. It is refreshing and moisturizing. I usually use it in the middle of the day when I feel that my skin needs a little bust of moisture. I think that I am going to love it even more in the summer months when it is hot, because this hydrating mist instantly refreshes your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I did enjoy Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice. It was nice and refreshing. I personally wasn't a huge fan of the smell, but I can see others not minding it. My only gripe with the product is that it really didn't do anything other than being a scented spray on your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved using this Garnier Skin active hydrating facial mist. It has Aloe juice and makes my skin feel soft. The formula is vegan and made without parabens, dyes or silicones.

"I was excited to try this product, as I suffer from very dry skin in the cold North Dakota winters. I used it on my face, but it didn't really improve upon my usual moisturizer. However, on a side note, I tried spraying it on my back, as it is hard to reach with any type of lotion or moisturizer. Though not as good as a lotion or moisturizer, it did provide some relief. If I buy this in the future, it will be for use on my back. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice was just not for me. I dont understand the need for this product. It did not make my skin feel anymore hydrated l, though I wish I did because I liked the overall vegan friendly, and paraben, dye and silicone free formula. I just personally don't feel the need for this product or any other product alike. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I received my sample of ""Garnier SkinActive"" Hydrating Facial Mist I was really confused at first. Because I did not understand what it was for. So I decided to test it out and see what it was all about. It is very very refreshing & leaves your skin feeling so soft! Not only that you can spray it on your face rather you have makeup on or not. It does not affect your makeup in anyway. This product is very affective & totally worth purchasing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all, the size of Garnier SkinActive ""Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice"" is awesome!! I'm too broke for any Mario Badescu anything, but this will definitely do! I have the driest of skin in the Winter season, and this aids in hydrating and keeping my skin looking fresh and moisturized. It does not bother my makeup at all when set on top, so I'm in love with this product even more. I have been spritzing it on my face even for the fun of it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product totally free to try so I can honestly review it for you all!
"This spray honestly is amazing. I've never used anything like it at all, so I was wary! It works on make up, no make up, straight from the gym. Its great and feels just as it says... hydrating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free sample of Garner SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist from PinchMe. I used it as a refresher a couple of times. It smells great and doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky. Tonight after I washed my face and applied moisturizer, I noticed my forehead felt really tight so I sprayed some of the facial mist on my face and before it dried, I applied the same moisturizer I had already used. After several minutes my skin feels softer and isn't dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice is a great product. I spray it on my face in the mornings before applying moisturizer. In fact some days I don't need to use moisturizer because of the mist. I received this product for free from PinchMe to test and give my honest feedback. I would definitely recommend this product.

"Here in the northeast, the cool weather months are so dry so even though i moisturize every night, halfway through my day, i start to feel dry and itchy again. I'm not into rubbing cream onto my face while at work so this product is a perfect solution. And it smells great as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I've always been a fan of Garnier SkinActive products and was happy to give the Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice a try. During the cold winter months my skin gets so dry and irritated and nothing I've tried so far has ever helped, that is, until I tried the Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice. I could tell a difference in my skin within minutes! It was amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample of the Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist that has Aloe Juice inside from the site Pinch Me. Here in the south it is so hot all the time it is a refreshing way to cool off and has benefits of aloe to go along with it. It is a good way to immediately hydrate you either in the heat or the dryness of winter without any smell and is easy to carry with you. The pretty blue bottle is slim enough to drop down in your purse or leave in the car. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Garnier SkinSctivd Hydrating Facial mid with Aloe Juice is easy to use and leaves skin feeling fresh and hydrated. I love this as my face dries out quickly when I work outside all day. It's a simple spray and go application. I received free product for my opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This face mist is really hydrating! I wish he spray was a little less direct but if you spray it far away you can cover you whole face in 2-4 spritzes. Over all, a great product that's worth your money! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I guess the concept of thosnlrpduct is pretty cool, but it's not very practical. The bottle is too large for me to feel good about keeping in my purse so the only time I'd use it would be at home - but the only time I'd want to use it would be on the go. Even on the go, it feels nice but doesn't really do anything. If you are chronically tired or hungover, I could see how spritzing your face every few minutes could be nice? Other than that, I just don't know how useful it is. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I struggle with dry skin, so this is the perfect product for my daily routine. Garnier SkinActive Husrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice is just what my skin asked for!

I'm really enjoying the Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice. The mist is very fine and soft you can hardly feel it.

I have very dry skin especially during the colder months. Ive tried creams but unfortunately due to sensitive skin they make me red. So Im very picky about what products I use.

"This product met my expectations for a facial mist. It is not any more hydrating than any other spray I have used but the mister on the bottle is excellent. It is super fine and doesn't leave droplets on your face. The product is slightly scented, which is okay but not ideal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Both my mother and I loved Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice so I've been sharing. It makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated better than any product before that I have used. It's gotten rid of my dryness better than any moisturizer I've used. It also seems that my skin sort of glows and looks brighter than usual. I usually like Garnier products but this was, by far, one of my favorite products that I plan to add to my routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved a free sample of Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice from PinchMe. I was skeptical before using this product. It was actually very refreshing though! It felt so much more refreshing and hydrating then just misting your face with water like I'd expected it to be like. I have recommended this to several of my friends. I think it would be great to use in the summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Garnier skinactive hydrating facial mist..... mist or more like stream. For a product that is to be used as a hydrating mist it is more like a streaming mist, have tried it 3 times with results of it streaming instead of misting with is kind of uncomfortable. It kind of makes you feel like a cat being sprayed with a spray bottle to redirect from doing something it is not suppose to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist has a lot of potential. Especially with the craze of hydrating facial mists. Pinchme sent me the full size version which was a great surprise. After a couple of uses, I noticed it does provide a hydrating benefit, no doubt from the aloe. However, I was not a fan of the smell which was a big turn off. It smelled very artificial and almost chemically. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am enjoying this product. I put it on when I get out of the shower because a shower leaves my skin feeling dry. I love the smell and I also like that after it dries quickly, I don't feel like anything is on me, but it does leave me feeling like my skin isn't as dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My first time trying Garnier skinactive and I love it I use it daily. I think the aloe juice makes it more soothing and relaxing on my face. This hydrating facial mist with aloe juice is one of the best things I used so far even my daughter says mom you have to keep buying that mist I'm so happy and thankful for pinchme I received my free sample from them and they did great on this because it's just what my face needs [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice is not for me. I like the packaging. The sprayer is super fine. I love that. Comes out like a fine mist. The scent is pleasant..... The product itself is not for me. I used it a few times and ecah time I did it made my skin feel dry and tight. I didn't like the way it made my skin feel. It was not hydrating at all. I have other face mists that are similar but actually make my skin soft and supple. This one fell short. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've never used any kind of facial mist but after receiving and trying this product, I'm sold. I've been using this product for about a week as a moisturizer after cleaning my skin.

"I received Garniet SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice from PinchMe and it is wonderful!! It's such a light refreshing mist on your face! Much more than I expected! I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because I started to break out shortly after using the product. Not sure if the timing was bad or if it was from the mist. After my skin clears, I'm going to try it again. So refreshing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Garnier Skin Active has a product that I was able to test. It's the hydrating facial mist with Aloe Juice. I really enjoyed this product. I thought it was super refreshing.

I have not yet used it while wearing make up. I do indeed enjoy the mist to the highest. Garnier Skinactive mist is the best I've ever tried. I know I will truly enjoy while wearing make up to give it an extra pop. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like this spay for refreshing makeup. It doesn't do well on it's own (it actually has alcohol as one of the first ingredients so I wouldn't use on bare skin) or as a setting spray. It does great at refreshing makeup though. It melts all my makeup that's separating back down into one later and helps it last that final 2 or 3 hours of wear.

"Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Alow Juice, is a really great product to keep your skin moisturized especially in the winter months. It also works as a good finishing spray to set make up. The scent is natural and pleasant. The mist dries quick and sprays on evenly. This an affordable and comparable option to high end products that are currently in the market. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I thought this product was nice, I don't know that I will but it in the future. It was nice to have a little spritz to moisturize my skin though. I love the Garnier brand and the Garnier SkinActive is pretty nice. The hydrating facial mist with aloe juice was interesting. It almost felt too wet though, which was a bit of a turn off.

"This stuff was cooling and smelled pretty good, but I didn't really feel like it moisturized my face at all. I've been using it since the day I got it and haven't seen any difference. I could see it being useful as a mid-day cooling/refreshing mist, just not anything seriously hydrating. It dries pretty fast as well which is nice but definitely takes a lot to really coat your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice feels so refreshing on my skin. It is the perfect way to rehydrate my skin during the day.

"I received a full size bottle of Garnier skinactive hydrating facial mist with aloe juice from pinchme.com and I'm indifferent about it. I love the idea of it and the scent is very nostalgic, but it doesn't really seem to do a lot for me. I don't wear much makeup, but my face is pretty dry, especially now that it's cold here for the winter. Maybe it's more beneficial with younger, healthier skin? But for being in my early thirties with dry skin, it didn't cut it for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product from PinchMe. Although it was refreshing, I didn't feel that the GARNIER SKINACTIVE HYDRATING FACIAL MIST WITH ALOE JUICE was particularly hydrating. It definitely didn't dry me out, but I didn't notice my skin feeling hydrating. The mist which I liked, especially when using it over my makeup because it didn't smudge or spray big globs unevenly. Overall, not a bad product, just nothing special. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I tried the Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice as a free sample from PINCHme. I tried using this product for several days, but didn't notice any difference. This product is to be used to hydrate and refresh your face. The aloe smell isn't very strong and dissipates quickly. The mist is very light and not hard on the face which is great. I don't see any reason to continue using the product though as it seems like just a fancy way to get your face wet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I get a ton of dryness on my face during the winter, and it's definitely helped keep it softer the past week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While trying the Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice, which was provided as a free sample from PINCHme, I was hoping that this item would really help during the drier months as we start winter. After a few applications, I was disappointed that it doesn't seem to moisturize and is just a glorified refreshing mist for your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice was very refreshing. It absorbed immediately and left my skin soft. It does get on everything when you spray it but it didn't leave any marks on my clothing. I received this product to try complimentary from PINCHme. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I first read hydrating, I did not expect salicylic acid to be one of the ingredients. If Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice did not contain salicylic acid, I would have loved it. It smelled clean, but not astringent and absorbed into my skin quickly. If you don't have any sensitivities to salicylic acid this would be a great product for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice smalls great; however, it doesn't work well for my skin at all. It will probably be great for others, but my skin just doesn't like aloe. Most people use aloe for sunburns, but it makes my sunburns worse. Thank you for letting me to try it though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample of the garner hydrating facial mist with aloe juice from pinchme and I wasn't really impressed by it and really not worth spending money on. It is refreshing but at the same time it just feels as if I sprayed water from my own bottle. Nothing fancy at all [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was skeptical about this facial spray. I've used many high end setting/facial mists and I haven't noticed any benefit. It's like spraying water on your face. With this product my face actually feels hydrated... even after the product dries. Now that I believe facial sprays have a purpose and this one actually worked I will be buying this over and over again. Thank you Garnier! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really enjoyed the smell of this and how refreshing it really was to my face. I have never tried like a facial mist before so this was a first time try for me. After use my skin was soft and supple I did love that also. Over all I would definitely purchase this after trying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Having both dry and sensitive skin, Garnier SkinActive Hydrating facial mist with aloe juice is amazing! It's light and refreshing, leaving my skin feeling nice afterwards (as opposed to tight and uncomfortable). The mist is very fine, too, which I like. I've had a few other facial sprays that feel a bit like getting splashed when you spray it... The only meh thing about this is that the scent is a little strong at first, but it dissipates quickly enough that I'll keep using it until the bottle runs dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product does not dry your skin out, it is best to use after a shower, and usually my skin is dry and rough right after I used hot water. This product is very lightweight does not feel like its on the skin, it adheres to the skin as a skin protectant and the healthy ingredients constantly do their job all day long, and you can sip off the product but I usually forget its on.

"I have super dry and sensitive skin, so I was excited to try Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice. Although it did feel refreshing and the mister was very dense/even, I was wondering how much it actual moisturizing it did since my skin felt dry later on. It also smudged my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin is dry year round but winters in the Northeast intensify that. I have tried numerous face mists that almost leave my skin tight. This is the first one that I have tried and don't feel like i need to reapply or add lotions. I will definitely be purchasing!! plus you can't beat that it is cheaper than the other brands.

"The Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice compliments a moisturizer in my opinion similar to the Clinique spray, but more cost effective. It probably actually works better than the Clinique one because it has aloe in it. I highly recommend using this as a compliment to your daily moisturizer versus wearing it alone. Overall great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice is a nice drugstore facial mist. It's soothing but I'm not sure I noticed significant hydration. However, I like using these types of products as a soother or refresher and for that this product works wonderfully. It wouldn't hydrate your skin well on its own but in conjunction with your moisturizer it does add an irresistible little something special to your skincare routine. I definitely recommend!

This product as much as I wanted to like isn't for me. The packaging is very appealing but the spray nozzle isn't good. This product doesn't mist a large area of your face.

Garnier skinactive hydrating facial most with aloe juice is nice to use but I cant necessarily say I see or feel a difference in my skin because of it.

I've been using the Garnier SkinActive Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice for a week or so now and I really love how hydrating it is! I use it at night before I go to bed and it sinks right it.

"GARNIER SKINACTIVE HYDRATING FACIAL MIST WITH ALOE JUICE is amazing! When I used it, it left my face hydrated and soft. With the winter coming, my face gets very dry and cracks.

"I received the Garnier Skin Active Hydrating Facial Mist with Aloe Juice from pinchME. I really have been enjoying this facial mist. I use it mostly after I do a face mask. I'll remove a mask, mist my face, and then apply my moisturizer. It really helps lock in moisture into my skin, especially with the harsh cold weather. The one negative for me, is the mister isn't the best. You have to spray a lot and spray it close to your face to get a good amount of product out.

When I use the product, it does leave my skin feeling refreshed, however I don't notice too big of a difference in my daily face moisturizing routine. I would say this is a nice product for someone who's looking to feel refreshed in the middle of the day, but I wouldn't say it has a huge significance in moisturizing your skin.

I���m not sure how I feel about this product. There were things I really liked and things I really didnt like about it. I loved the fact that they sent a full size bottle to try! I loved the scent and the packaging was appealing. I did not like the fact that it was a mist. I didn't like the sensation of praying myself in the face with a cold product. I also didn't feel that it moisturized my skin as much as I would have liked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

When it's sprayed on the face you feel this refreshing feeling and it dries quickly, and in top of that it smells really good. It is very convenient because I use it sometimes with make up on. I would really recommend it and its all natural. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love this facial mist because it is so light and refreshing! I use it throughout the day when I feel my face drying out and it doesn't interfere with my makeup. I didn't give it 5 stars because I think that the fragrance could be more appealing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I had never known that Garnier had there own mist. I love using it. My teenager sister also came to visit me an spotted it on my dresser and also started to use it. When she texted me later on that evening to know the name so she could get some, because it left her face dewy soft. Which it also left mine soft. An I use a two face cream regiment. Love the product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It works really well, the down sides are: when I sprayed it on after I did my eye makeup, I had to reapply my eye shadow even though it says it won't smudge it, and the scent is pleasant, but it gave me a headache after a while. I do love that it is light feeling and you can't really tell you have it on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a sample of GARNIER SKINACTIVE HYDRATING FACIAL MIST WITH ALOE JUICE from PinchMe.
