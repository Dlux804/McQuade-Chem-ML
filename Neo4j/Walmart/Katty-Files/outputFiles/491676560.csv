"my daughter has severe eczma since she was a toddler. Many sources, known or unknown, would trigger a flare up. I was afraid that the mask could trigger her skin allergy, but no, it actually eased her skin irritation. Thanks, Neutrogena!"
"I love this mask ! after I used it, it felt like my face had drank a bottle of water. My skin is smooth and hydrated...love it !"
"It was a little tricky to get on, (only because this was the first time I used the Hydrogel Mask) but once on, I enjoyed the cool feeling, after I removed the mask, my skin felt fresh, not dry."
This product will never fail you. It goes on very easily and the removal is fast and easy. Thank you Neutrogena for making another fine product for everyone to use!
I like the gel-like material and that the mask is actually transparent. It has very gentle nice fragrance. Definitely feels wet but it could be more hydrating. Don't expect miracles if your skin is very dry.
This mask was amazing and feels great on the skin!
I bought several mask after watching a Jackie Aina review on Youtube.
Highly recommend this mask! After application my dry face felt like it had drank a glass of water. So hydrated
"I love this mask it always makes my skin so soft and glow, but I can never figure out what side goes on my skin can you please let us know how to use this mask better."
"This is literally the only sheet mask I can have on my face it's not uncomfortable, it's soooo cooling on the skin and makes my skin looks so nice. I don't write reviews normally but I had to for this because it's that good at least for me!"
"I love, love this product! This my go to mask whenever I want to pamper my skin. It's like going to a professional facial salon. It makes my skin feel very soft and smooth and the results lasts a few days! ❤️❤️"
I bought the Hydro Boost Hydrating Mask today and used it tonight. From the moment I removed the mask from the pouch I was impressed with how it felt. Once I put it on my face I knew I found a keeper. It feels so nice on your face and when you remove it your face is so soft and it just glows. I will definitely buy this product again and again. Please consider making a glove and sock using the same technology for my hands and feet.
This is outstanding. It makes me face smooth instead of dry and itchy.
I love this mask. I would totally recommend it. It is very refreshing and soothing leaves your skin feeling soft and rejuvenated. Totally purchasing again...
I just came across this mask. I have combination skin my skin can get really dry. I love how the cooling gel feels! It keeps my skin soft and does not make break out.
This mask is so good...I just finished using my second one and it's amazing. My skin is so soft and hydrated after using this mask. I'll use it as long as neutrogena makes it!
I usually don't write reviews but I am in love with this mask. It sticks to the face without falling off. It is so cooling to the skin and relaxing. My face was glowing after I took it off. I will keep buying this mask!
"I was so desperate for something to help my EXTREMELY dry skin. Nothing worked until this. I can lit-erally feel my skin gulping this moisture up. I like the two pieces, I can make sure I'm lining it up right where I need it most. It is super slippery coming out of the packaging but that means there is so much moisture that is just waiting to get on my skin. I'd definitely recommend laying down and relaxing with this on - no need to worry about it sliding off. LOVE LOVE LOVE."
"I wish I read some of the reviews before I purchased this and used it for the first time. I am not a Neutrogena fan, but I decided to try this mask. It broke me out the next day, and I hardly get acne anymore. It did not even hydrate my skin, and it stung. Will never purchase this ever again!"
The reason I didn't give 5 stars is I didn't realize that the textured side face down and also the mask is in two pieces which made it somewhat difficult to put on. It's been 10 mins since I took off the mask and my face does feel more hydrated and supple. I will definitely buy again.
"I really wanted to love this mask. I use Neutrogenaâs Hydro Boost Hyaluronic Gel (the fragrance free version) and love it. I was hoping this mask was something similar to that with maybe some added ingredients that would be good for dry, dehydrated skin. But to my dismay, when I got home I read that this mask has fragrance in it. I thought I would give it a try anyway. The 2-piece mask was very slimy"
"Just bought the blue hydro boost sheet mask yesterday. The smell is super fresh and light. I have dry skin and the hyaluronic acid makes my skin so soft! I do not care for the 2 piece mask- one piece for the nose and up and one piece for the lower part of your face. It makes it too complicated and it doesnt want to ""adhere"" to your face as well as a one piece sheet mask does. That is my only complaint though and it wont stop me from buying again!"
I bought this today I've been wanting to try. I left the mask on for 30 mins. It brought back a brightness to my face that I had 20 yrs ago. Will definitely buy again. Now I'm gonna try the overnight gel mask. Love Neutrogena products.
"This face mask was amazing ! I love trying new face masks, and this one literally hydrated my face like crazy. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who suffers from dry skin."
"But when I opened it everything slid out with lots of if water like substance. Wasn't sure what side was what so just slapped it on & hoped for the best. Once it dried it held pretty good, figure I used the right side. Love this brand, disappointed with the lack of info & slime but willing to try a different one."
"Like the product but not the design. The product stays in the bottom of the package instead of on the mask. Also the instructions are not clear about which side of the mask to use, and the pieces were stuck together and difficult to apply. The product and price are good but I did not like the mask design."
"The Neutrogena Hydro Boost Mask is large and in two pieces, easy to put on. It feels cool and gooey. But before 10 minutes were up, my face started aching. After rinsing my skin felt smooth and supple. Hydrated! Now, its been days since I used this, and I have an acne breakout. I have rarely ever had a pimple in my life but suddenly I have at least ten pimples. This has never happened to me before. I will not buy this product again."
"I love this particular face mask by Neutrogena. The hydro gel boosting mask revitalizes and transforms your skin from dull and lifeless, to radiant and glowing. Leaves face so soft and silky, clean and hydrated. One of my absolute favorites. Wish I had"
"a buggy fill if these face masks, along with all of the other amazing products Neutrogena makes. Love them all, and I totally recommend this product, and all Neutrogena products."
"I bought this because a friend recommended it, I was so excited! I opened it, I found my"
"Mask folded, dripping a solution, and"
Not on the white sheet. The eyes and mouth are not cut out and it is folded over. Not the best fit for my face.. maybe for others. It did hydrate and cool my face but the hydration did not last as long as I wanted.
"I can never figure out which side should be against your skin (the textured or smooth side). Other than that, I love these masks! You can leave them on for a long time and relax and there's still a good amount of the ""juice"" left in the package that I soak up with a cotton pad and use as a serum after the mask. My skin is always happy when I use these!"
"This mask surpassed my expectations, the formatting of the packaging which not only one piece mask but 2 which I personally loved it's not the typical mask.I had no trouble putting in the mask and it kept in place perfect.I waited 30 minutes and WOW skin was GLOOooWINg, reduced the appearance of pores and the redness from my skin.I followed with the Neutrogena Hydro Boost City Shield facial gel mist and am loving the glow all together !"
"... I can only say I liked it. If it was designed better, I think I could give it 5 stars, but only 3 as is because it was difficult to take out of the package for starters. Once that was accomplished, it was awkward trying to get two slippery to stay in place for 15 minutes. I'd suggest starting over and making this a one-piece sheet mask. That would be a 5 star product in my book."
"I Didn't like that the mask can in two separate pieces. There was a line from cheek to cheek that did not get covered from the mask. When I opened the package, I was not sure what side when on my face."
In addition there mask was too dry. There was barely any gel product on the masks.
"Just like a lot of the other reviewers said, it's super confusing as to which side actually goes on your face and it kind of just slides out of the pack. I didn't realise it was in 2 pieces until the bottom part slid out into my bathroom sink, luckily I had just washed it!"
"It did, however, leave my skin feeling super soft after having a very dry day."
"I'm wearing this mask for the first time as we speak. I've tried several different sheet masks from different retailers over the past month; the hydrogel is honestly one of the most luxurious I've tried so far. Of course, I personally love jelly masks so much more than fabric. And this one smells reeeally pretty. It clings to the face well and has a very refreshing cooling affect. I'm pleasantly surprised :)"
Amazing- i have very dry skin and this made my skin feel and looking amazing. I was confused about which side went on skin. You couldnt tell which side had moisturizer. It show be labeled or color coded because being in envelope ingredience gets squished and distributed all over.
I was so excited to try this mask as I had been searching for a face mask for quite some time. I use other Neutrogena products like the gentle scrub and the white tea & Vitamin E face cleanser that was recently discontinued. I applied the mask with no problem and waited the allotted 15 minutes. I felt some tingling and took the mask off after 15 minutes and my cheeks were ruined! Bumps broke out immediately. I am devastated. I wouldn't say I have sensitive skin but my face is ruined. I am afraid to try other products!
i tried this on my feet lol. I recently had a chemical peel done on my feet which worked but its been peeling too long. 2 weeks of peeling was more than enough to do what i needed and this face mask is what finally stopped the peeling. I was trying everything to stop the dry peeling but nothing worked not even treatments made for the feet. My feet are really hydrated after using this. The peeling has not returned which other products could not resolve.
"I use this once a week and my face has never been so hydrated and nourished. The entire Hydrogel line is amazing. If you have oily skin, like me, this is the best moisturizing face mask. It's non-greasy formula actually assists in balancing my Ph so I'm not constantly secreting oil, that is trying to hydrate my dry patches. I recommend this to all skin types."
Best Product Ever!! So happy that I bought this product!
Love this mask! So moisturizing and smells fresh too.
I love the mask results but not sure which side to use. There is a smooth side and a texture side. The packing is not good so u can't tell what part is stuck to the white backing.
I bought the product a few days ago because I seen Jackie Aina using it. All of my goodness spilled out when I opened it which i didn't like so I had to open another one carefully. I love the way the product smell and how my skin looked afterwards
WHY ARE THERE FLAPS FOR EYES AND MOUTH INSTEAD OF FULL CUTOUTS? MAKES MASK HEAVY AND PULLS DOWN. OTHER THAN THAT STRUCTURAL ISSUE WHICH I DONT LIKE - FEELS AND WORKS GREAT. ALSO AFFORDABLE TO DO WEEKLY.
I got burned by Murad 30 Discovery kit and this just got my face down to a base that wasn't so dry. This mask hydrated my face back to health so I can walk in the winter without feeling gross and dry!
"It may work for some especially ones that don't have sensitive skin like myself, I've tried all of these masks and they've made my skin all dry and flakey. So disappointed ☹️"
Excellent face mask! I ahve very sensitive skin & it's hard to fibd products that won't irritate my skin. This mask is cooling & hydrating. Since receiving in the Walmart beauty box subscription I have purchased many more of these masks at my local Walmart. Extremely glad that they are available!
Left my skin super soft and hydrated without irritating my skin!
I received this mask as part of a beauty box bundle and finally got a chance to use it. I am a BIG fan of the hydro boost gel and this felt like a MAJOR upgrade. Left my skin soft and super hydrated. I will definitely be adding this mask to my rotation.
"I have been using sheet masks for years and this is not one of the better ones. There are not good instructions on which side to use. The mask was stuck in the bottom of the package and the gel was not stuck to the mask, rather left behind in the package. I have used other masks with much better designs. The product is good but mask needs work."
"I have used the Neutrogena Hydro Boost Face Mask that comes in a pod. This one you apply the mask to your face. The pod version, you rub into your skin, go to sleep and the next day wash off. It leave my skin feeling totally hydrated. I recommend this"
product.
"I tried these after seeing some others try them on social media. I love them so much! A little hard to apply, would love to see it become a 1 piece item as well as having the eyes and mouth pieces already removed. It left my skin feeling smoothe and hydrated! Thank you!"
This is the first sheet mask I've ever tried. It went on easy although I do think the nose area of the mask could use a little more work. I also wish the mask was just one piece instead of two. Overall I loved the product though. Left my skin feeling hydrated but not sticky or oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this mask twice now and both times, it left my skin feeling so moisturized and smooth, but without any heavy residue. My only complaint is that it's difficult to tell which side of the mask to put on your face. I have been assuming it's the side that lies agains the white film backing, but there's a clear piece of film backing on the other side, so I hope I'm doing it right...."
I really like this product but the texture makes my skin above my lips itch. :(
"Smells strong after taking off and face stings bad not the good clean sting the my face now hates me, I wanted to love this product."
Love this mask ! I would give 5 stars but it was a mess when I opened the package . My skin felt smooth for days .
"the mask itself isn't cut right as well as made me break out like crazy after, overall will never buy again"
"Complete waste of money. I don't understand the great reviews here. It was a slippery slimy mess. For the most part I love neutrogena, but not these."
"it's annoying to put on. bad packaging. I only received part of the face, not the whole face as shown."
So simple to use and so effective. Your skin feels delightfully moisturize and soft afterwards. Fantastic
We used the masks for the first time and after 5 minutes his face was red and mine was fine. I don't know what caused the redness. He is also itchy and his face is severely irritated.
"This mask did not work for me. I did not like that it came in 2 pieces. It did not stick to my skin and kept slipping off. I also didn't like the 2 different sides, was not sure if it made a difference which side I put on my skin."
I love this mask! I have sensitive combination skin and I've tried a lot of stuff. This gel mask is one of the few products that doesn't burn my face. Plus it leaves my skin feeling so smooth.
Very hard to keep on face you had to lay and not move but kept sliding anyways. Didn't feel any different afterwards either. I mean it's ok but I 0robably would not buy in the future
Gave to daughter. She loved product. Has easy open packaging. Goes on easily stays put and comes off easily. Then just toss. Makes her face feel refreshed and smoother.
i don't know know who packaged this but i could've done a better job with my toes. the mask wasn't even on the paper and i had to dig it out from the bottom by the time i dug it out and untwisted it all the product was on my hands!
"I love these masks by Neutrogena, my daughter brought me some for Mother's Day, they are easy to use and afterwards your skin looks so refreshed, moisturized and healthy, I now use them regularly now."
I buy this item every week. It is is a regular in my skincare routine. My skin feels so refreshed and my dark circle are reducing. My complexion is clearer and i use my foundation lesser.
I like using this... it gives a great glow to my face... feeling hydrated skin after use... definitely would like to use in future and also recommending everyone to use this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I tried this mask for the first time tonight. I'm hooked my skin had been looking dry and the weather didn't help. I was shocked at how refreshed my skin looked once I removed the mask...
"I would love to have given this mask a better review, however this hydrogel mask does not stay on your face long enough to do any good.. I put the mask on following the directions only to have it fall off after 5 minutes. Reappling did not help and I could not get it to stay on.. The product might be good if you can get it to stay on. Very disappointing!"
"I love this item, my skin feels smoother, cooler. Some of the old red marks on my face gone. It feels much better if you leave it in the fridge for few minutes. The only downside is fragrance. I wish this was fragrance free as I have sensitive skin. I use also cleanser and the multivitamin booster."
"This mask is so refreshing, cooling and it's so convenient to apply! The two piece mask that Neutrogena has came out with is beyond functional. They stay in place so well without the gel seeping out the sides. There's also never too much leftover once you take it off. Great product and perfect for a quick quench for your skin or a girls night in!"
"I'm 55 years old but have never experienced dry skin until recently. I put the mask in the fridge for a couple hours, put on some spa music, applied the mask and laid on the couch for 25 minutes. Amazing difference! So cooling and hydrating and helped a lot with puffiness around my eyes. I like that the eye holes aren't cut out. I shut my eyes and put the flaps over my eyelids. Love it and can't wait to try the other masks."
I bought this mask to help hydrate my skin during this dry winter. The package was hard to open. The white paper that was supposed to be on the mask was not attached so the mask was sliding around in the package and I had to unfold it to apply. It does not stay on your face without touching it every few minutes. I do like the coolness of the product. I guess it was not what I was expecting. Will not purchase again.
I bought this a while ago and forgot I had it. But I used it today and I absolutely love it! The gel contours to your skin so well. My skin feels so soft and supple and it helped with the dry spots I had. I'm gonna go to the store and purchase 5 more because I loved it so much.
"This mask is perfection! Easy to apply and was extremely hydrating to my skin! My skin had been drying out so much and nothing was working! I used one last night and it was amazing! My skin felt so much better and when I woke up, my skin hadn't dried out overnight! It was so refreshing!!! Thank you! I went out today to buy the Hydro Boost line! I hope to have equally amazing results! Thank you!!!!"
I received this mask free through Home Tester Club. I really enjoyed the feel of this mask. It was very relaxing and really made me feel good. I try to do masks as part of my self care routine and I really enjoy trying new mask but I will probably buy more of these and add them into my routine regularly.

Neutrogena's Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask was the first mask I've tried and it was an awesome alternative to the mud masks I was familiar with using. The mask didn't drip or slide as I was scared it would and end up in my eyes or mouth. It made my face feel cool and hydrated while I wore it and left my face soft and refreshed without any greasy residue left over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A coworker purchased this for me. I was psyched to try it because it is winter in my skin was dry. After applying mask i felt it burn a little but then it cooled. I put timer on 30 minutes then removed it and went to bed. The following morning my was face looked flushed and felt extremely dry. This mask did not go over well with my skin.
"When I opened the package it was a mess. Both of the pieces slid of the film when as I tried to carefully remove them. I didn't know which side I was supposed to apply to my skin, because it doesn't indicate on the package. Now, in reading the responses to some of the other reviews, I know that the textured side is what you should apply to your skin. Unfortunately I did it wrong and it was a waste of money. Maybe if I tried it again without the mess and better instruction I would know if it works well."
Feels instant relief from dryness and reduced skin burning kind of sensation .....
So far every mask has been torn in half and the white backing falling off
I love how hydrating this mask is! I was pleased with how well it soothed my sensitive skin! I also loved the light smell it had!
My face looked so good I went and bought the facial cleanser and another face mask. Made my face more hydrated and got rid of the bags under my eyes.
Great before going outside to do autumn or winter chores. Protects your face from the drying wind and keepsit hydrated.
Tried for the first time today and unhappy with the gluggy mess that came out of the package. Also didn't know which s ide to apply to face. I don't think I'd buy again
I didn't like them. They wouldn't stay on my face and they are so messy. It was difficult to figure out how to put them on and the eyeball holes weren't even cut out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have super dry skin right now because of the weather, even dermatitis, and needed a pick me up. This sheet mask is awesome! It is so gently, non-irritating, soothing and gave me a boost of hydration. I really saw a difference."
My skin is very dry and this mask moisturized my face so good and my skin looked a bit brighter as well. Very impressed with this mask. Will definitely buy again.
"I love the mask it smells nice and the whole hydro boost line is my new skin care routine and it has never looked or felt better, I recommend all of the face mask and the hydroboost facial cleansers and moisturizer ❤️"
The package was difficult to open. The product was all folded up and not on the white paper as it should have been. Keep slipping off my face. Perhaps you have some bad lot numbers and manufacturing needs to be looked into.
I've been using this two times a week and I've noticed my face never goes dry as how it use to I believe this mask does wonders! Overall leaves my face feeling fresh and hydrated just as advertised. Love using this mask
was a little tricky putting on but then all masks seen to be a little on the slimy side but felt cool once it was on definetley mademy skin moisturer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First, came in two pieces. Was so slippery anf wet put first piece on face, fell off on floor had to throw away. Too wet and slippery was not staying on. Threw it all away."
Terrible product...pieces were separated in the package and the backing slid off as I removed it from the pouch. Kept sliding off my face! Feels like I have a film over face hours after I used it. Not the clean feeling I wanted. Will not buy again.
"Used this product for the first time last night and left it on for 30 minutes. My skin felt SO amazing afterwards. . I'm definitely going to start using these in my routine. I also started using the hydrating boost in the thin bottle last night as well. I get super dry skin, especially in the winter, so I hope this helps! The only thing that made me sad is as soon as I got out of the shower this morning, my nice smooth skin was back to dry :( Hopefully the more I use these products, the better my skin will get!"
"Neutrogena® Hydro Boost hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask is large and in two pieces, easy to put on. It feels cool and gooey. But before 10 minutes were up, my face started aching. After rinsing, my skin felt smooth and supple. Hydrated! Now, its been days since I used this, and I have an acne breakout. I have rarely ever had a pimple in my life but suddenly I have at least ten pimples. This has never happened to me before. I will not buy this product again."
"I bought 2 of these products the other day and I open the first package and the solution wasn't all on the mask anymore now yet it was in the pouch. I tried the second on two days later and open the package and had the same issue. However, the product that was leftmost on the mask helped my skin feel so refreshed and clean. Great product burn disappointed with the solution left on the mask."
"I love it so much! This is the first mask I have ever used just because I trust Neutrogena. But-- how often can I use it? Everyday? Every week? The packaging does not mention anything. It would be a good idea if you include this information. By the way, I love the blue packaging and that the mask is blue."
I am impressed by this mask! I tried another gel mask by neutrogena and it burned and it had way too much fragrance. But this mask smelled refreshing and it also felt cooling on the skin. I do think it made me a little itchy but once I removed it I felt hydrated and bright.
"I like this particular mask because it gives the skin a great boost in hydration. It feels good also. The only downfall to this mask is I can't use it on a continual basis. I have a very sensitive skin and fragrance does not go well with my skin. I would only recommend this to someone that does not have any skin sensitivities or skin conditions like myself. Neutrogena, is it possible to create this same mask without fragrance? Most dermatologist would not recommend any products that contains fragrance to the face."
"I was very surprised after trying this mask. I don't usually trust not professional cosmetic companies. But this mask hydrates your skin very well. Yes, it's not easy to place on the face. It sleeps off, but the result worth it. I would defiantly keep using it and recommend to my friends. Thanks, Neutrogena!"
This mask has been amazing for my skin!! I was using Proactiv MD and I dried my face out so bad my skin was flaking off...I started using this mask and it had my skin cleared back up within a couple of days!! I have continued to use this mask! I cant wait to try the others!!! My skin is so soft and so refreshed after this mask!
"Neutrogena Hydro Boost hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask quenches your skin, deeply hydrates, and leaves your skin supple and hydrated. Neutrogena is trusted brand and I never use any other brand. Neutrogena Hydro Boost hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask is a must"

"OMG this mask is amazing! I loved this one, in particular as compared to the other 2 because it suited my needs the most. In the winter, my skin gets really dry and uncomfortable and this mask was extremely soothing and wonderful! I loved it so so much! This mask is extremely high quality and made of superior materials, don't know how they did it! Would greatly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Neutrogena® Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask was a perfect solution for my dry NY winter skin. It was easy to use and has a pleasant smell which is not too overwhelming. The packet contained a gel that seeped into my skin and making it feel supple and hydrated without being oily. I rubbed the rest of the gel after the mask session into my skin. I woke up feeling great and my skin felt bouncy with more elasticity. Would definitely recommend. A++ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This item seemed to work pretty well as far as hydrating my skin. My other issues with it are that the pieces were too small to make it to the edges of the face and it was difficult to put in on my face according to the instructions because of the plastic sheets.

My skin gets so dry in the winter but I also have sensitive skin so it's a delicate balance to hydrate and slough off dead skin without getting irritated. I absolutely adore this mask! My face felt like it had been thoroughly hydrated and I didn't see any typical peeling of dry skin like I normally do when the temperature drops. Very happy with this mask!

The Neutrogena® Hydro Boost Hydrating 100% Hydrogel Mask is awesome especially during the cold dry season when your skin need a lot of hydration.

"This mask did a fantastic job to make my skin turn from dull & dry to hydrated and full of moisture. It was easy to put on & never slid around on my face, & when I took it off my face looked plump. After rubbing the rest into my skin, and waiting a day, I noticed a very big change in the overall ""glow"" factor as well as my dry dull skin being gone. It's been a week and the dry skin hasn't come back yet thankfully. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the NEUTROGENA HYDRO BOOST HYDRATING 100% HYDROGEL MASK from the Home Tester Community totally for free to try it out. it proved to be one of the best facial masks I have ever used. My skin feels so comfortable and relieved after using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This mask is now one of my new favorites! I love how this makes my skin feel so soft. My face is usually dry and this mask made my face feel back to normal. I highly recommend this product and this is a mask I a going to continue buying for myself. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved how this mask felt on my skin and when I peeled it off it revealed a softer,glowing,dewy and more rejuvinated appearance.I am so pleased with the results from this mask and would love to use it again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wow, I could feel a difference instantly after removing mask!! I bought on a whim and I am hooked!"
Very convenient on the go or really anywhere to use
I didn't feel like it worked well on my skin as well as I thought it would. I did like the scent.
This wasn't something I would typically use and I didn't like it.
Very hard to get out of package and slimy would not biy
I like how it left my face feeling it was a little messy. I think I would buy the product again.
love this mask makes me feel so refreshed and clean will be buying this product more often
"This product is great, it moisturizers plus has a cooling affect. My face felt so smooth after use. Definitely part of my beauty routine!!!"
Absolutely horrible experience made me break out x100 about 24 hours after use and dried my skin out more than hydrating it. So disappointed
This is my favorite mask i have ever used.. i love gel masks in general. This one really hydrates the skin just like the hydroboost moisturizer!!!
Love It - makes my skin feel great and hydrated. And given reasonable price - I can do several times a week. Only thing I do not like it that it is not one piece and there are tabs around the mouth and eyes that weighs the mask down.
I love all kinds of face mask but this one is a little different I like how it has a cooling sensation and it feels like your skin is more breathable and just more refreshed than others
I wasn't in to using masks before but lover this one. Made my face feel cool and refreshed and left it feeling smooth with a healthy shine. Would keep using this product for years.

Cool idea but very messy. The backing was off the mask and messy to work with. Skin felt nice but not worth the hassle of product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I LOVE THIS MASK! Had my face feeling hydrated for DAYS! It smells great and it absorbs into the skin and actually works! VERY Hydrating! Great for the winter months. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When I opened the package, the mask was so slippery it came off the backing immediately, before I could even get it to my face. And why 2 separate pieces? I don't get it. The actual serum felt great and made my face feel hydrated but many other masks out there do the same and are much easier to apply."
"I bought three today Because someone suggested them and i have dry skin and thought this would help, not even minutes after taking this mask off in rubbing the product in it seems like my face suddenly started to peel worse as it went from my nose to under my eye."
It would be perfect if it had no fragrance which is no benefit to skin.
