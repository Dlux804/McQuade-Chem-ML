"All my friends - and even strangers - want to know my secret to flawless, perfect skin, especially when i share my advanced age. This Golden Balm beats the most expensive skincare brand! Needless to say, Walmart has the best price."
This product was a great buy and really does make my skin softer and wrinkles less noticeable. I had received a sample and used it and was pleased with results and thought I would try for an extended period of time. I am very pleased with results.
Better then other famous & expensive creams.
This is the best I have found for the price. Great for 50+ crowd! I break out easily and this did not make my face break out. My skin soaks it up and it doesn't leave a film.
"This neck and chest balm was creamy and easy to put on. The scent was a little strong for me, but I loved the size of the jars and the jars themselves were pretty. I especially liked the fact that this kit came with a product for your neck and chest area because I feel that this is an important area for ageing women and doesn't get included very often.

I LIKE
"I think,this product is fantastic! From it's light, wonderful scent..To how soft and hydrated it makes your skin feel. All you need is just a tiny bit at a time because,a little truly does go very far.( I feel The only down side is:Using more than about a quarter size for your whole face can cause your skin to feel a bit oily.)

"I bought this moisturizer thinking it would lend golden glow to my aging skin in addition to other old age problems such as need to firm skin, smooth away wrinkles but apparently not. It is very thick to apply, thicker than what I am used to, has a nice smell but there is nothing special about it. I did not see any changes in my skin. Will not be buying again."
"Too much scent in it and it didn't do what I thought it would do. Disappointed. Also, too greasy, doesn't soak in very well."
"I can't believe that after just 7 days my 49 year old skin looks better than when I was 30! My skin was dry no matter what I used. No longer, my face is silky smooth and the crows feet that I have were getting deeper. Now you can barely see them. And what dark circles under my eyes? Those are gone too! After just one week. I can't wait to see what the next few days/weeks brings. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The chest,neck and face balm instantly became my favorite. It really has done a wonderful job on my chest and neck. I've noticed how much of a difference in the way my neck and chest appears. Firm and my skin doesn't look so dull as it did before I started using the balm. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using L'Oreal Golden Balm for over 2 weeks now. Maybe its my personal preferences but I find L'Oreal Golden Balm to be very ""oily."" It stays on the surface of my face instead of ""sinking"" in. I'm getting used to the smell but not the fact that as I get ready in the morning the sweat bead gather on my forehead and I find myself needing to blot my face for a hour or so before the issue is reconciled. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I noticed an immediate increase in the hydration level after using this face cream. My skin felt soft and refreshed after each use. After a few weeks of using the product I noticed a more youthful, healthy glow. My skin is healthier after using this product and people at work have even commented on how much better my skin has been looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for a little over two weeks now. Pros: My face looks and feels much softer. Cons: Within the first few days of using it my face broke out. But to be fair, my face breaks out with any change to my regimen. Overall I will keep using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this cream primarily at night. I like its thicker luxurious feel. The cream spreads easily, a little goes a long way. I don't find the smell offensive or that the cream leaves an oily residue. I will buy this cream again and highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is great! I finally have something to put on my face, neck and chest. It has lessened the signs of wrinkles, even in the little time I've had it. I've noticed a huge difference. It goes on smooth and my skin feels wonderful. Feels hydrated especially since its winter and it tends to be drier during this time of year. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Parish Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm Face, Neck & Chest made my skin feel so soft without that greasy feeling. The smell was fresh and clean without being overly scented. The only negative is that after using it for about a week my sensitive skin had a slight reaction. It was such a disappointment because it made my face so hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this products gives great moisturizer to neck and forehead. I used it twice a day and it seems to have eased the fine wrinkles on my forehead. I would recommend this product to the older ladies. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"With the weather in decline , i found the Golden Balm to Be a life saver i just apply this before my foundation keep my skin moisturized and supple all day . Its a great product and i recommend this for daily use, its awesome. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although I have never used a neck cream before, this was a good product. It felt smooth and light. It made my neck feel supple and somewhat tighter. I noticed the wrinkles were a little more diminished. The overall product seemed pretty good. The balm was good as well and it had a nice cooling sensasion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is very dry in the winter, especially my face, and this is very thick cream, which is too thick, even for my dry skin. If you have extremely dry skin, then this would be the perfect lotion for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE this balm. When I got older (I'm 41) for some reason, my chest area was extremely dry, even in the summer. I thought it may have been a product I was using, but it wasn't, just another change that comes with getting older (and better lol) This product not only moisturizes my neck and chest, it smells so yummy, and feels so good on my skin. I apply it immediately after my morning/night showers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the face, neck and chest cream for a bit now and it has made my skin very soft. It's not greasy at all and goes on quick and easy. Leaves my skin feeling great! The only thing I have to mention that may be a dislike to some, is the scent. It does have a very flowery scent to it, so if you are one wear perfume, maybe this product is not for you because it is strong enough to over power a light perfume you may wear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this on face neck chest and yes even my hands dont want them to age so quickly, this product gives you all day moister to your skin and ontop of that it smells wonderful none greasy just soft skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin was super dry and needed a good face cream. I am glad that I got this product because it is really good. The smells is great, it is making my skin very soft. Great to use every night before bed. My only concern is that I noticed that if I use the lotion during the day my face becomes very greesy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I see the word ""balm"" I wondered if it would be thick. The balm is actually perfect for sleep and days without makeup. After a week of using my skin feels very soft and very nourished. It is the winter season and generally my skin tends to be a bit dry so this balm is great and I love the fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the face balm is great for the skin when paired with the night/day cream. You face immediately feels nourished and moist. My skin is usually dry in certain areas but after twonweeks, I can definitely notice that it is getting softer and firmer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall I think the Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm is a good product. My skin feels soft and hydrated without being greasy, however I only gave it 4 stars because the Balm is so thick. I would prefer a product that smoothed over my skin a bit easier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This went on splendidly, however, it did not absorb into the skin as well as one might hope. I did like the texture and it delivered as promised with smoother skin. Also I did notice slight reduction in fine lines. But if you put this on your neck and chest and wear your hair down, your hair will become oily where it brushed against the chest and neck area. That was definitely a downfall. The pros in the end outweighed the cons, but only slightly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This balm is amazing. I love the way my neck already looks firmer after only two weeks. It melts into your skin and is super easy to use. I love that the directions are easy to understand. L'OREAL tells you exactly what order to use their products in. They tell you exactly how to apply [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Face, Neck, & Chest Balm was extremely smooth to put on. It left my skin feeling moisturized and soft. However, the fragrance in the balm is very strong and left my skin irritated. I would not suggest using this product for anyone with sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My neck and chest have never looked better! I am 32 and have sun damage from growing up in south Florida. My chest and neck looked prematurely older than I felt they should. I have been using this for around 2 weeks now and I feel like my neck and chest look much younger than I could imagine! I have the whole system and have been using all of them and am very happy with the results. My skin is softer and glowing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Not only does this product smell great but it really leaves your skin feeling hydrated all day!! It doesn't have a greasy feel like most creams. It also doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy after applying it. It is very light on the skin and PERFECT for the cooler weather that dries your skin fast! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal has just put did themselves again. Golden Balm goes on smooth and leaving skin feeling amazingly soft and shiny. The soft smell and the smooth texture makes you feel so feminine and happy just to know that there is a product out there that works perfectly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product is Amazing!! I was looking for something to help my ""turkey neck"". In two short weeks I noticed a difference!! The lines are less visible. This balm feels wonderful on my skin. It hydrates without being greasy. A new staple in my skincare regimen!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Paris is a common household name among women. However this facial cream is honestly some of the best I have used. During the winter months my skin takes a beating especially my exposed face. Nothing seems to help longer than a few hours. I applied this under my make up. By 8pm my face still felt moisturizer. I will def be using this morning and night and can't wait to see and feel how my skin feels after a few weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the golden balm is super effective in that my skin felt firmer after just a few days of use My skin feels soft and hydrated and it just looks and feels smoother to me I have used this for 2 weeks and have noticed a big change in the way my skin feels and looks I have dry skin on my face and it feels smooth all over no dry spots at all, I love the smell and the texture of the cream , a little goes a long way The cream is silky smooth and so is my face and neck [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First, I like that this has neck and chest in the title of the product. Typically, I neglect those areas in my skin care routine but not with this product. Like the eye balm, this is thick and rich and makes my skin feel healthy after applying it. I appreciate that it's not greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this golden cream on my neck only. My face tends to be too oily, so putting this on my neck is perfect. It goes on great, and I can tell a difference with the way my neck feels. I do think someone with a different skin type would really like this on their cheeks as well. I only out this on my neck though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was probably my favorite product in the age perfect line. It's thick but didn't feel overly heavy. I worked this into my neck and it had a slight tingly feeling so I felt like it was working. Would be best for mature skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for a couple of weeks, and can see a positive difference on the skin of my neck area. It is a very thick product, so I had to stop using it on my face. I have normal skin, not dry at all. This product is too rich for my skin type. It works great for my neck, and the rich formula is making a difference on that delicate area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutelyfell in love with this product. It works for the face, neck and chest. After using for a week I can tell my skin is already softening up. I really like the smell and willcontinue to use. I was afraid that it would be greasy, but its not. 5 stars for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The golden balm is amazing! It has completely eliminated any dry winter patches I've chronically had in the past. It only takes a little bit for my entire face so the product is going to last a long time. It does have a floral scent that I am not particularly fond of, but my skin has cleared up and feels so much healthier that I can ignore it, but it was very surprising to my nostrils at first. I will most definitely be buying this balm again when I run out of my current jar. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm Face, Neck & Chest cream is light and refreshing! I love the way it makes my skin feel revitalized and clean. It is not too perfume smelling and does not itrritate my skin. It goes on smooth and is creamy. It is not oily. It is light and I can't even tell I have it on. Slight discoloration on my neck appear to be lighter and going away. I can't wait to see how much better my skin looks after a few more weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried this product along side L'Oreal Age Perfection day/night cream, eye cream and facial oil and loved it. This was my absolute favorite of the bunch. It make my skin feel so smooth and taut. And leaves such a lovely smell, light and not at all chemically. I have very sensitive skin, to the point I can't wear makeup but this product did not aggravate it at all, quite the opposite it feels great. I defiantly plan to continue using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loreal face ,neck,and chest is the best. I noticed a change within a couple of days. My skin is smoother. Looks healthy,and young. The fine lines are disappearing. The dark spots are fading. I have a healthy youthful appearance to my skin. Definitely will continue to use [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I found the balm to be a bit thick and greasy. While it kept my normally dry skin moisturized, it did not seem to soak into the skin but rather rest on top of it, leaving an oily appearance. I applied my makeup on top of the balm and did not notice any caking though. I would also prefer the balm be unscented. There is no noticeable difference in my skin other than it being more hydrated but other benefits like firmer skin may come with more product use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A nice light citrus smell, soaks in nice doesn't leave the skin feeling greasy, which is a plus. It's a heavier cream, if you prefer a lighter cream, this may not be a fit for you but overall a nice, heavier cream for dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am expecting a later in life baby and it has caused some stretch marks. This product is perfect for that. It might not be the intended use but I would definitely recommend that other older mothers look into this and purchase it to keep their skin looking great. I have also used it on the areas recommended and found that I enjoy the scent, hydration, and ease of use. It is a great product that can be expanded into other areas of skin care. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think Age Prefect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm is great. It helps moisturize my face neck and chest leaving it smooth and feeling great throughout the day. Also making it firmer. Not fond of the perfume smell but other then that I love it. You will too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the Golden Face, Neck, & Chest Balm and it's great. The blotches on my chest are clearing after only one week. My neck is firmer and it doesn't look like I'm forming another chin. I would highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Before trying this line of products, I was never much for taking time for an extravagant beauty regiment. These products are super quick and simple to apply, I am sold. This balm is very nice, it's thick and it blends in so smoothly. My skin looks so much healthier and brighter. I have found myself using it every day when I get up and when I go to bed. This is the first beauty product I will actually take the time to use before bed, well, this and the day/night cream and the eye cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this stuff! I am always skeptical when it comes to trying new face creams. Most of them do nothing but leave my skin dried out afterwards, or completely oily. After just the first use of the eye cream and face, neck and chest balm I am hooked!!!!! I have been telling everyone I know about this stuff! I will continue to use it and spread the word!!! Thanks!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. It was the first one I've tried that didn't make me break out. I love the creamy feel of it and the fragrance isn't overwhelming either. It made my skin feel so soft and silky. I will definitely continue using this product until it is all gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin is changing completely, every time I use the cream my skin becomes more smoother, rejuvenated,healthy looking. I for sure will continue using L'Oréal perfect age from now on. You should try it 2 ,u won't be sorry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product. It seems greasy when you first apply it, but it really moisturizes amazingly well and has not caused me to break out. It really helps me to apply and blend my foundation when I apply this Balm first. I had a small spot on my chest that was really weathered looking from many past sunburns and this balm has already made that spot start looking really healthy and moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the creamiest moisturizer I have ever tried. It glides on so smoothly making your face and neck feeling very soft. With my skin after using other moisturizers, my forehead would start flaking by evening. But not with this product, it has my skin still feeling so moisturized until night. Definitely the best day moisturizer I have ever used. I highly recommend this product if you have very dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I feel like this product is doing what it's supposed to. I do feel some tightening upon application. Unfortunately, since the package says it's geared for mature, dry skin, I think it's not geared for me. I'm almost 40 but my skin is not dry and the added ""moisture"" is having an unwanted effect, clogged pores...in my neck and chest. I wonder if my skin was not on the normal to oily spectrum then I'd be more satisfied with the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm Face, Neck, & Chest is a great way to help feel younger and well moisturized. I am fifty years old and used the product for only one week. I have already noticed my skin feeling tighter and smoother. I will continue to use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This balm has a thick creamy texture and a pleasant scent. The scent is a nice clean scent with an almost a soft citrus after tone. I like that although it's thick it absorbs quickly leaving my skin feeling moisturized but not oily or greasy. Within 5 days of using this is notices a difference in the feeling of my neck area. It wasn't tight and dry feeling. The itchiness I get from the winter disappeared after the first use. I'd highly recommend this product to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This was very creamy and smooth feeling. It glided onto my skin nicely. I really liked the feel of it. It was very easy to put on. There are written directions with pictures. This made my neck look more toned and feel very soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have a new favorite! Of the 3 products I have tried, this is my favorite. I do not have tons of experience with this type of product but so far I am hooked. My skin feels and looks softer. This product has a slightly thicker and richer feel than the night cream but still does not feel heavy when you apply it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I ave trouble finding good creams due to my sensitive skin. This will definitely remain as my day cream! Light but very moisturizing. The smell is also nice. Not overly perfumy. Very subtle womanly scent. Can't go wrong with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been applying the L'Oréal Golden Balm since the day I got it! About 2 weeks I an have seen or felt a noticeable change maybe it too soon to tell. I do have to say the Balm is very rich and a small amount does the job. It has a very pleasant smell and I am going to continue to use and hopefully I will see or feel even if it minimal change. For the price this is a winner it's worth the money!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This balm moisturizes very well and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and youthful. It absorbs well and has a lovely rich texture and nice scent. I use this balm at night as part of my skin care routine it leaves my face, neck, and chest feeling nice and smooth and looking brighter and healthier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using the entire collection of the Loreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition for a little over a week. I think the Golden Balm is the game changer. This is giving my skin the glow that everyone is talking about. I would recommend this collection. It is a must try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this product, it's very creamy and light weight, it doesn't leave your face feeling grease. I've never used L'Orel products before and will definitely continue using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Face, Neck & Chest Balm (1.7 oz) is a great product. Now going into this product It has a very light smell and isn't greasy. It feels nice. I would recommend you use this product alone without lotion. It would make it greasy. Overall I didn't really see a difference with use but I would continue using it. I love how it makes my skin feel soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that after using the balm I feel not only moisturized but also clean. I actually look forward to using it when I wake up and before bed. It has a soft smell to it that is mature. Too many products have a floral scent and this one is not. The glass jars also make it feel expensive and a luxury to use. The packaging is great and enticing, I just wish it fit the jars more instead of the cardboard fillers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was kind of leery of this product at first because it is so thick. I had nothing to worry about. L'Oréal has done it again. A great product. This balm goes on so smooth and feels like silk against my face and neck. It has a little pleasant smell to boot. This balm will definitely become a part of my moisturizing routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream smells great and makes my skin feel super smooth. However it does feel a quite oily. I think it's too greasy to wear under makeup during the day and I'd be worried about what it would do to my pillow cases if I wore it at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The golden balm is like butter for your face has a very mild scent. I tried many facial moisturizers but this takes the cake it really moisturized and hydrated my skin. I have very dry skin. I used it right after I washed my face. Would defiantly recommend to moms in their 30s 40s. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This one is perfect for hydration. It goes on smooth and doesn't not make you makeup look bad. I have been using this product in the morning and at night and can see the difference in my skin.

"I have been using the Face, Neck and Chest Balm for about four days. It says you can use it day and night. I prefer to use it just in the evening. It's a little heavy for use in the morning. I think it's a good night product especially in Minnesota in the harsh cold of winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am in love with the L'Oréal Age Perfect Eye Cream and Golden Face Bam. They are a new must in daily skin care routine. I love I quickly the eye cream gets rid of the puffiness under my eyes. The Face balm give me that beautiful glow that I get compliments on. It's only been a short time but I can see a difference in my skin already. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I chose to only use this product for my neck and chest because I was already using three products (Age Perfect eye cream, Age Perfect facial oil and the Age Perfect day/night cream) on my face after washing. Like the rest of the Age Perfect products that I tried this worked well. Noticed a change in the texture of my skin which I was pleased with. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The loreal Paris age perfect hydra nutrition golden face, neck, and chest balm and the facial day/night cream works very well. My face is always so dry. Espically in the cold weather. The first time I have used both loreal face products..... What a noticable difference. It rubs on easily and also had a great smell. I no longer have dry skin on my face and will continue to use. Great products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

It feels like mini spa treatments it smells so good not overpowering. I recommend this to my mom and my sister. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is great for dry skin. I've noticed a big difference in just two short weeks. A little bit of this product goes a long way. I gave it four stars due to the smell. It has a really good perfume smell but I was worried as to having a scent on my face. It didn't bother my skin but it might to someone who has extremely sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"OMG, noticeable difference in my skin after just a few days. Faithfully using it morning and evening and my skin is so much softener. Getting into a routine with all the products and this 51 year is looking younger [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was a little hesitant about trying this product. I've never found a balm that I actually loved because most are so thick and heavy. This one is perfect! My skin instantly benefited from this product and it was evident that it did. The glow I have after using this is amazing. The skin on my neck and chest even looks younger. My skin looks great! This will definitely be a beauty must from me from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm Face, Neck & Chest a week ago together with L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Facial Day/Night Cream every night before bed. It's amazing. My skin feels firmer and smoother and looks brighter. I feel like it has even softened lines in my neck area. If your on the fence, I say try it! The top row of pictures was before and the bottom row is a week later :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I LOVE THE FRESH LOOK IT HAS GIVEN ME. HAS A NICE SMELL AND A CREAMY TEXTURE. I SEE VISUAL DIFFERENCE IN MY SKIN TEXTURE AND LIGHTENING OF SOME BROWN SPOTS. I LIKE THE GOLDEN GLOW THAT IT GIVES YOUR FACE. DEFINATELY WOULD BUY THIS PRODUCT. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is an excellent cream. I have been using it for about 3 days now and my skin is very moisturized. And it lasts!!! I tend to be a little handed when using creams because that is our first instinct; however, you don't need to do that at all with this product. A little goes a long way! Very impressed with the product and the full size samples they sent! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a product that I will continue to use daily. I was skeptical about the ""balm"" part of the name at first. How wrong I was!! The balm is light and creamy and I could feel the texture of my skin change after just one use. I will continue to use this product...for years to come!! Thank you Bzzagent and L'Oreal for the opportunity to use and review this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have dry skin throughout the day but oily skin when I wake up in the morning. I have been using this for a week and I love it! Its not to greasy, yet just the right kind of moisturizing effect that makes my skin soft and supple. Did I mention the scent? Very good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a really great night cream...I followed the directions as to smooth it down the neck area as well as an over the entire face, it is a very thick rich cream and I found out quickly that a little goes a long way...I did think at first that it was going to leave a greasy feeling, but to my amazement it left a very soft smooth non greasy feeling...in a nutshell...I will be buying in the future!

At my age my skin has been dry and dull this product puts the moisture back into your skin the small lines disappear and your skin feels like silk. I told my sister and my girlfriend and they are buzzing about this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the L'Oreal face, neck and chest balm is very rich and creamy. I have not noticed any tightening in my neck and chest area, but am still satisfied with the moisture I have received. I will continue to use this product and hope to see tightening results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wow. Just wow. I have been using this as my night cream for five days now. I see the results every morning. My skin looks tighter, brighter, and healthier. It used to be dry and rough. Now, I wake up to hydrated, soft cheeks and neck area. I also have noticed that my 'whiskers' are not as visible under my chin area! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the product so far. I use it just as the directions state to and when i told my mom about the campaign i was on she immediately wanted to both join and try out the products. I may be jumping the gun but i feel like i can already notice a difference i will continue and see what happens. I would really like to know if this product is safe for sensitive skin before i used it just because i have sensitive skin just like alot of women out there so that's important.

"I shared this balm with my mother and she was so pleased with it she bought herself some! We were really impressed with the suttle, clean fragrance.

"What I enjoyed about the loreal paris age perfect hydra-nutrition golden face,neck,and chest balm is I could use it all overy my entire face. It helped even out my skin in and made it feel really soft as well. It did not have a strong smell which I also liked since it covered my entire face. Would highly recommend using this product if have dry patches on face,neck,and, chest. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Omg I am in love with this moisturizer. I have really dry skin especially during the winter time. Well this product fixed that. Not only did it moisten my skin but it gave me a glow. All of my friends complimented me and said they thought I was wearing makeup which I wasn't. This is def staying in my morning and night regimen. My only complaint is that if your not careful this can clog pores and blackheads so be sure to wash your face Morning and night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm Face, Neck & Chest. It feel so cream and gose on smoothly. The sense of these products smell so good!!! I use all of the 3 L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The product has a fragrance that is a bit too strong and thick. I think it would be better for someone more mature with very dry skin. I have normal to combination skin and this was more than I needed, so I may pass it on to someone else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the golden balm is a great product. It left my skin feeling smooth and moist. At first it felt greasy, the longer it stayed on though it didn't feel greasy. 12 hours later my face still feels moisturized and smooth. It wasn't sticky or gunky goes on smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
First off its packaged nicely and the bottle is very cute. It also smells good. It was easy to apply and a little goes a long way. Everything was nice and easy until i put on my glasses. The product is so greasy that my glasses slid off my face until i couldnt take it anymore. It may work but i had to wipe it off so that i could wear my glasses.

"I love Golden Balm, it's is great for use on your face, neck and chest. It is very thick and creamy but a little will go a long way. If you have oily skin, I wouldn't recommend this product but if you have dry areas or all over dry skin this works great. I had dry patches that after 2 days were gone. I was not able to use this in the morning because it took a bit of time to absorb and I usually need to apply makeup right away. Best used at night! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how this makes my face feel. It doesn't leave a grease film feeling all over my face. It feels like it really hydrates my skin. I have noticed my skin looks brighter and more even. I will continue to buy this to use! I am very happy with the day and night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This products makes my face feel very nice and soft. It make my face look vibrant and brighter. Normally after I wash my face it feels dry but using this balm my sling doesn't feel weighed down. It give my skin a glow but doesn't make it to shiny. It also has a really nice smell. I will continue to use this product and recommend it to my friends and family. Falling in love with this line more and more each day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My chest area has lately been very dry and the Golden Balm is the first cream that I have used that really penetrates and make that area look more supple.

The L'Oréal age perfect hydra nutrition golden balm is a excellent product . Always use to get dry patches on my face not anymore!!!! I apply it every morning and don't have any worries about needing to reapply very smooth feeling balm only one down side is it's just a bit oily but that does seem to go away as the balm dries in a few minutes would definally recommend this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When I received this kit I was completely skeptical. I didn't think it would work for women of color. I gave it a try anyway and now I'm hooked. I tried the golden balm and was awesomely surprised. It gave my skin a nice glow and was moisturized all day. Even after being outside in the cold weather. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the L'Oreal face neck and chest golden balm. If you haven't tried it ..go get it it...it goes on smooth and smells really nice and feminine makes me comfortable in my own skin I've been using this and my skin looks nurished, bright and healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This neck/face/chest cream is great! I have been using it mainly on my neck and chest twice a day. It seems to be tightening up the skin around my neck and leaves my skin very soft. I would definitely purchase this item again and love that it's non-oily and only has a light scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is seriously thick moisturizing balm. It's a pretty heavy balm for my skin and has a perfumed smell I could pass on. This would be great for drier aging skin as it provides serious hydration. The packaging is beautiful and gives an elegant feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I never thought of using a face/neck balm as I didn't see the need. I was wrong. First of all I loved how it felt on my face and neck. I have noticed softening into my neck lines after using th balm for three days. The balm is not heavy and absorbs quickly into the skin. I love trying new products and love sharing my thoughts with others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was skeptical about this balm because it sounds like it would be too thick to put on my naturally oily skin. I use this at night an a regular day/night cream during the day. I think I actually prefer the texture of this cream to regular moisturizer. It's thick, like body butter, but for your face and neck. As long as you don't use too much, it's just a great deep moisturizer. It also smells great, very citrus-y and refreshing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The balm worked great for the dry patches I have on my face. I tried it at night on my whole face and my skin was really soft the next day. But unless you have dry skin all over, it is a little to thick for the whole face. When I tried it on just the places that are very dry I could feel relief within minutes and the dry skin stayed soft for two days without having to reapply! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is wonderful. The smell is pleasant but mild and the consistency is jus right to easily apply and rub in. I'll see the effects over time, but for now, it does a great job of moisture get my face and neck with feeling greasyor thick. Very very nice product! (I'm not clear how this product differs from two others in this group since each is for moisturizing face and neck.) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is the best moisturizer I've ever used. After washing my face in the morning and at bedtime, I applied the cream on my face, neck and chest. I've only used it for several days but I can visibly see a difference!! Lately, my skin has been dry and older looking. After using this product my skin feels and looks great!! Thanks for a great experience!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The only thing I don't like about this is the strong scent. It did some good work overnight the first time I put it on. I woke up with a brighter, healthier complexion. However, after a couple applications, something started to irritate my skin. I would classify my skin as combination, senesitive skin. It started to feel ""stingy"" when I applied and the scent (which is usually the culprit for my irritation) became too much. It's too bad because I think it really did do a good job!

"Mmm smells amazing, a little goes a long way! Goes in smooth, and if you accidentally get to much, no biggie, it goes in nicely. Love this product, just wish they would explain a little more the steps and if they have the cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am very pleased with the way this product feels. It goes on smoothly and creates a sort of glow to my complexion. It does leave a somewhat greasy type feel at first,but after smoothing evenly into the skin it's soft with a pleasant smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I live in Northern Maine, this is a very cold, dry time of year for us and my skin suffers. L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Hydra-Nutrition Golden Balm is a powerful blast of moisture to the trouble areas around my chest and neck. It feels amazing and does not irritate my skin. There is no greasy feeling or unpleasant scent which is great as I am also a nursing mother. This Golden Balm is a ray of sunshine in the cold Maine winter!

"For dry skin such as my husband`s this product does it all. It leaves the skin hydrated and moisturized through out the day. He uses it twice daily after washing his face with water. As for myself, I have an oily skin which becomes unusually dry during cold weather. So, I decided to give it a go & started using once daily after washing my face with my liquid face wash. So, far after a week`s use, I am Liking the results. Thank you L`Oreal for keeping it `Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It took up to my 4th day to start seeing for myself some change but when i seen, WOW! Is all i can say. My chest is so soft and my cheek bones lets say they are nothing short of amazing. Now when my family ask me ""How is your skin doing so well?"" one answer: L'oreal!(of course with the picture i took when i got my product!) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not a fan of this one. This lotion has a heavy scent and a heavy texture to match. When you apply the lotion, it feels like it sits on the top of your skin. Also, because of the heavy scent, my skin was not happy with me after I applied this to it. On a positive note, I did not notice parabens on the ingredient list on this one, but there are some other rather scary sounding ingredients in its place. This one missed the mark for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first night i used the face balm I think I used too much. It is very balmy for lack of a better word. Very heavy and I felt weight down. I used it before I went to bed and can't imagine putting it on before I put make up on. The scent is almost non existent but what you could smell was nice. The second night I used less and felt much better. I still would only use it before bed. My skin was softer in the morning, but will have to report back on whether it tightens. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the golden balm however I give it three stars because it isn't the best I've used however it's only been two days. It's a little too thick and heavy and kinda cakey. I wish it was lighter. It's not very different from other face and neck creams I've used other than it's a little thicker. I noticed this whole product line comes in heavy containers which is not ideal for traveling. I would love to bring it along on trips. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was so excited to try this product. I am 30 years old and feel it's time to start a facial regime since I never have done much. I have great skin, but in the past I have tried moisturizers that break me out. So I have done nothing for years. The bottle is nice and the cream looks amazing. It felt amazing all the way from my finger tips to my face. My skin feels moisturized, smooth and glows. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like that my face feels very soft and well moisturized. There's a lot more moisturizing in these products than I am accustomed to using as I have normal skin with mild cystic acne tendencies. That being said, I will use these products sparingly as the are for dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far, so good. I've used this product twice and my skin feels smooth. Scent is light and pleasant. Not greasy at all, glides on smooth. I tend to have sensitive skin and so far, no irritation or itching. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm used to using low-rent facial lotion, so the thick, creamy nature of the Golden Balm took me by surprise, in a really good way. It goes on smoothly, blends in in a non-greasy way, and left me feeling moisturized all day - which, in the middle of a Minnesota winter, is high praise indeed. The scent is lovely too - citrusy and refreshing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ohhhhh i am so in love with this balm! Finally something that addresses the area most women need help with! The neck and chest. I have sun damage on my chest and face creams just dont work in this area that well. I loved it the first minute i used it! Absored quickly nice fresh scent no heavy perfumes...smooth, soft feeling skin. Where have u been all my life? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way my skin seems brighter & firmer. I'm so eager to keep using this product, and find out long term results. This cream has not caused me any itching, or discoloration.

It is exactly what it's name is.. Golden! I put this on after I wash my face on the day I didn't put moisturizer on. The balm took to my skin very nicely. It also has a wonderful smell that makes me excited to apply it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Applied to my neck and chest overnight and woke up with very soft, supple skin. Might be a little heavy for my face during the day under makeup, but works great overnight when I need a little extra hydration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
What I would want to know before I get this product is will it help my face neck and chest? I did not know if I would like some thing that goes for all 3 places. I found out that I did and it left my skin feeling like I had new skin. I found that I would spend my money for this product and would use it every day. I am very picky and have break outs but I did not with this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"With just a hint of color that fades,this cream glides on for superior coverage. It did appear to have a hint of fragrance/ or makeup smell?

"I think the product will continue to do what is advertised. I can actually feel the balm moisturizing my skin. It does feel a bit greasy on my face, so I don't recommend putting make-up on after. I choose to use it at night or on mornings I am not working. I will continue to use to see the progress of some of my wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've never used a décolleté cream before until now. Trying to stop the signs of aging before it's too late. This cream is very rich and only need a small amount. The consistency is rich and thick.

"Every year, during the fall and winter seasons, I worry about the dryness of my face's skin. So as soon as the fall season starts, I look for a moisturizer that makes my skin feel soft and hydrated. I'm loving this product because it works great on my type of skin. Since I started using it, I feel that my skin is softer and hydrated. I can even use it under my makeup.
