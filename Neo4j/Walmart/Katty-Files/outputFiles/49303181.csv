I have tried this product for 2 weeks now and I love it!!! It helped with my dark circles and was very hydrating under the eyes! I would definitely recommend this product to all my clients and friends.. Plus the packaging is so pretty and light! This product comes packaged great and has a great deal of product inside...
"I am now on my third jar of this eye cream. I absolutely cannot do without it. My dark circles under my eyes are almost gone, and the puffiness is better as well. This also has a thinner texture, that works well for me as I can develop milia if I use too thick a cream under my eyes. I normally apply this when I apply a serum that I want to give time to sink in, like my retinol product. If my eyes seem especially dry, I will apply my face cream under my eyes as well. This product has a permanent place in my skincare regime!"
I have been using this for a month now sometimes twice a day sometimes once and I have seen a significant change I use to have really dark under eye area and it has gotten lighter way better than before. I had really bad wrinkles as well under my eye and those have gotten way better as well almost gone actually so I am very satisfied with this product . Thank you elf
"This, with the elf eye roller, are my STAPLES for my eyes in the morning. Between these two products and some eye drops, my eyes go from sleepy and red and puffy to pretty awesome.. fast. I love this and hope they never discontinue it. For the price it's totally a great product."
Been using this for some time now. Use it every morning and night. Eyes feel hydrated and less tired. Refreshed and cooling feeling. One jar lasted about 8-10 months.
Not very happy to open a brand new eye cream and see very little product inside. So much empty space! I really hope mine just happened to be a bad batch and not all of them look like this. Don't think I'll get much use out it.
I Bought this Product around two weeks ago and barely started to use it one week ago and the first couple of days I noticed what other high end creams could not achieve; reduce my dark circles. Also my wrinkles around my dark circles started to fade away and reduce in size. I always thought that buying expensive us creams would make a difference and only to find out my remedy was just a few blocks at target. I love elf and thank you for making my skin better without going broke.
"I brought this and used up the entire container, and I really saw no difference in the dark circles under my eyes. Admittedly, I'm extremely pale, and those circles are pretty extreme. It did treat the dryness around my eyes quite well, but I could have done that with any lotion. However, if I got in my eye it burned really badly. Which, is a bit upsetting with an eye cream. As you can imagine it did happen from time to time."
Use this product every morning. This definitely helps with the bags under my eyes :)
"So, I have been using this for a few months with my nightly routine and... I LOVE IT! I really do see such a difference in the appearance of my eyes. They are much firmer, brighter and I see almost no lines or black circles and over all they feel smoother! And for as long as I have been using this, I still haven't made a dent in the cream. A little goes a LONG way. Will buy again."
"I bought this eye cream about 2 months ago and was super excited about it, but after using it for a couple of weeks, I got a pimple under my eye! I stopped using it for a few weeks, and then tried again, and the same thing happened. It might just be that my skin is super sensitive there, but do use caution."
"Honestly, even without the breakouts, I didn't see that it made much difference."
"I bought this cream approximatively two weeks ago, since I suffer with dark brown under eyes due to the fact that I am naturally tan and let me tell you that this cream helped brightening up my dark circles! It did not help with the size of the bags under my eyes though. Still an amazing product! I LOVE IT!"
I bought this 4 days ago and have used it morning and night and am very happy with the results already. It hasn't diminished my circles completely just yet but i definitely notice a difference and can't wait to see a month from now.
I purchased this a couple of months ago and used it religiously...I really got no results for using it twice a day EVERY day I thought I'd see something. But for Elf's prices you can't go wrong trying out products.
"amazing product, it actually works. I see a difference when I need to treat puffy eyes. However, I bought it at Walmart and noticed they changed the container. I liked the old one better (shown in the picture)"
"I really enjoy the way this cream feels on the skin under my eyes and after 2 weeks I can feel the skin in that area becoming more plump. I just wish it had a more pleasant smell. It's odorless when applied to the skin but if you smell it in the jar, it kind of smells like glue. Don't know if it's the cream or the plastic of the container."
A little goes a long way! Great at night and under daily make up. Helps so much with fine lines and dark circles.
I love this it makes my undereyes feel amazing! recommend 100%
"my eye area is very sensitive and have tried many, I was so happy to find this one. It doesn't burn and works great, and what a fantastic price!"
"It works very well, I didn't notice how well it worked until I stopped using it for about a week. My skin feels tight and firm but I give it 4 stars because it doesn't quite minimize my under eye dark circles. Other than that it works great!"
It is cooling so gentle this product it awesome my eyes love it usually I swell or something with others this is the best stuff I will continue to use this from now on out and it last long time too cheap price great product
"I don't notice any help under eyes, but it's great for the lids, under eyebrow, and the fine lines between the eyes and hairline, especially after removing makeup."
"I loved the Origins ginzing refreshing eye cream, but its absolutely expensive. I wanted to give this a try, more affordable product. I love how it feels, very moisturizing, & feels great when applied cool. Doesn't irritate or dry out my lids. A little goes a very long way."
I use this right before my concealer; this allows my very dry under eyes necessary moisture so that my concealer doesn't cake up.
I've tried this and it doesn't really help with anything. It also gave me very dry and flaking skin around my eye and eyelid. I'm not allergic to any skincare ingredients so I'm not sure what caused this.
"I've only been using this for a few days but I must say, I see a difference. I use it day and night as instructed and have notice that even when i am lacking sleep and have to run out the house without my concealer I still look rested and awake. This is only the beginning so I am excited to see the results after weeks of use."
"I've been using this eye cream for about a month and the most i can say is, WOW! I'm 44, caucasian, combination skin with virtually no wrinkles. I DID HAVE the beginnings of crows feet at the outter corner of my eyes but after about 4 weeks using this eye cream, i have no sign of crows feet at all. The crepe skin under my eyes is there when i smile big but my eyes are smooth otherwise. Also, my under eye skin is very sensitive and with most other eye creams I've tried will swell, with this eye cream i have no, ZERO, swelling."
"FYI: the jar is MUCH tinier than it appears, with the product cavity being only a tiny portion of the container. The actual product is effective as a nice, light moisturizer, but I didn't see any improvement with dark circles, firmness, etc. In conjunction with cost / quantity, I really felt like I just paid for the plastic jar. I understand they are trying to make a more upper-end appearing packaging, but IMHO, the packaging felt really wasteful."
"I had my doubts about this product but after only a few nights of using it, it really made my under eye darkness disappear! I use it under my eyes, on the outer corners, and my entire eyelid. My skin feels so hydrated and looks refreshed! No more darkness around my eyes, I was so surprised. And you really only need a very small amount. Great value and well worth the money!"
First time user. I like the creaminess and lightweight cream but i have very sensitive skin around my eyes in it tingled almost to burning sensation with first use. I don't know if my skin is just irritated today and it just made it worse. I will try again tomorrow and for the next few days and see how it goes.
I have terrible eczema that would get so dry at night and be flaky and red in the morning no matter how much I moisturized the night before. I have been using this product for a month and I loved it since first use. It is velvety and extremely lightweight. Remarkably moisturing. My face hadn't been this smooth in morning for at least 2 years.
"The packaging is very deceiving, there is a miniscule amount of product compared to the container it is in. It honestly feels just like regular old lotion, nothing special about it for the eye or ""illuminating"" in any way. I notice zero difference from when I use this and when I don't. super disappointed."
On a whim I decided to try this out because other eye creams are so expensive. I got it in the mail and tried it out. INSTANTLY my puffy eyes were a lot smaller and my eyes felt hydrated. I have oily skin and it felt a little greasy. (I pat before applying makeup) But I was so impressed I had to write a review!
I have purchased eye creams that were 5 times more expensive and my last one made my eyes red in the morning. I simply can not believe hoe great this ELF eye cream is. Brightening and moisturizing without being greasy. I was so impressed with the eye cream that I just ordered the serum and night cream. I am 66 years old and I will never purchase an expensive eye cream again!!!
"Tones down early morning puffy bags. Love the new skin care line! My skin hasn't felt this soft EVER. I read a review from a previous submission regarding the products (specifically the night moisturizer) have a bad smell??? I have a 4 products and there is literally no scent. I am sensitive to smells, and I smell nothing. I will purchase again for myself and friends/family as gifts. Thank you ELF!"
"I got this a couple of days ago, but have just now had a chance to review. Like the others, it'll take about a month to see results; but I already love the basics: scent, texture, ingredients, etc. effective moisturising (that is usually an immediate effect) and leaves a nice canvass for makeup, etc. After a bit, I'll come back with a ""results"" review!! :) Meanwhile, love, Love, LOVE the packaging & the price!!!"
I've been using this eye cream for a few months morning and night to help my dark circles and haven't seen any improvement. The eye cream kind of stings at time and it isn't the most hydrating. I've noticed my undereyes would be drier and the dryness would be noticeable especially when wearing foundation or concealer. A little goes a long way though. I use this twice a day and have been doing so for a few months and I still have a long way to go before finishing the jar.
"I've been using this product once a day (the directions say to use it twice) for about 3 weeks now and I can tell in my magnified light up mirror that my under eyes have gotten significantly less puffy and more even in color, love the product, easy to use and you get a very large amount for the price."
"Let me start off by saying that I have chronic back pain and every morning I wake up unrefreshed, I have that tired eye look. This product has succeeded in helping me hide it. I only have to use a little bit everyday in the mornings, so this product is lasting me a long time. A little goes a long way."
"I bought this a while ago, used a little, and then forgot about it, but I unearthed it from my bucket and I used it on my undereye bags, I have had some real nasty bags lately due to working so much, and it improved the colour of them for the most part, like you can still see that I have bags, but it's not as noticeable now. The scent is pleasing and it's ice and creamy on the face. I like the product for the value. Great buy."
"I received a free sample of this eye cream in my most recent order. I've always had dark circles and puffy under-eyes, even pricier eye creams didn't help. After only two days my under eyes were less puffy! My mother even commented on how well rested I looked. That was all the convincing I needed to go to the store and purchase the full size version."
I ordered this online anf it came in a few days ago. It's been two days since I have been usjng this and..my eyes have brightened soo much!! My dad thought that I was wearng concealer. I have horrible dark and puffy undereyes and this works wonders!!
"I bought this a month or so ago, and it's slowly lightening my dark circles and making them appear less puffy. My dark circles are genetic, so I don't expect this product to make them disappear, but it's definitely making them lighter. It's also making my eyelashes grow? Not sure if it's supposed to, but it is (totally not complaining). The only reason I'm rating it four stars is because I wish it were in pump, I personally just feel like that is more sanitary. But anyways, I definitely recommend buying this!"
"Just in less than one jar of this, this almost 62 yr old felt a lot younger since my eyes had smoothed and didn't feel quite as heavy as they used too. Dark circles had lightened and make up would go on much smoother. I have allergies and wasn't hindered by this product...yea! Thanks I would recommend to everyone. NLH"
"I bought this about a month ago, and I was super excited to find an eye cream that was affordable and had great reviews. To say I was dissapointed is an understatement. The cream was silky, went on easily, and was not greasy under my makeup. However, this cream burned!!!! It hurt to the point of brining tears to my eyes."
"First, the packaging is excellent on this product. Second, this eye cream is quite hydrating and smooth. I put this on after my eye primer and before moisturizing. I've tried other, very expensive creams and this one ranks right up there! Thanks, E.L.F. for providing great products and amazing prices!"
"I bought this product to help with my dark circles caused by school... upon applying this product the first time I noticed it felt very uncomfortable on my skin, but the feeling faded as I went on my day. About a week of applying, I got little bumps underneath my eyes where this product was being placed and it felt more sensitive than usual. I've never had any issues with other e.l.f products in the past but this, I wouldn't recommend."
"I bought this since I'm trying to take a lot better care of my skin without spending tons of money. As soon as I put this on I could already see a difference. My one eyes is significantly better with fewer bags and my dark circles are brightening up. The other eye is being a slacker and while showing improvement, it is slowly working."
i have cryonic insomnia ad as a result get bags under my eye's.
i have tried many different things to help with this & after falling in love with e.l.f's make-up products i jumped to try there skin care items. & have loved all of them so fare. this is no exception it brought life back to the skin under my eyes. leaving them to feel hydrated and less purple looking. it didn't sting or cause irritation.
I got this on Friday and have been using it all weekend (it is Tuesday today). I have noticed a decrease in the fine lines around my eyes already!!! Even my coworkers commented on it (and I was lazy today and did not wear makeup). I will be buying this again for sure
"I bought this with mute intentions, not sure what would happen since I had some pretty dark circles and have had them around my eyes most of my life. So far it has lessened the darkenss around them which is shocking. I am very impressed and hope it gets better the more I use it."
"I was so excited to finally get this in the mail and I started using it right away. Over the past three weeks I have added it to my nightly skin care regimen and have seen amazing results! I have genetic dark circles under my eyes, and they are fading! NO scent, NO sticky residue, ALL results."
"I would definitely recommend this product I use this as part of my daily Beauty routine every night my under-eye area my eye area is smooth lines are less visible and dark circles have diminished. I've been using Illuminating eye cream for about a month now and I've seen the difference under my eye area, you must use it consistently on a daily baisess."
"After using it, it did brighten my eyes but after multiple uses all it did was make my eyes appear swollen...and it would be sooo hard to wake up after putting it on overnight. the price is a little high for the amount of product u get but overall it's ok. I stopped using it tho"
"I love this eye cream. I often have eye creams that although they are under the eyes, they still irritate my eyes. This ELF product does not irritate at all and I swear I can see a brightening effect as soon as I apply it. I can not do without this."
I got a tiny sample of this with my last e.l.f. Purchase in the mail and I wasn't expecting it to really do much for me but thought what the heck? It was free may as well try it! When I finished the sample I went and bought a full size because it's great it's hydrating and really helped with my under eye darkness and as a person with chronic insomnia caused by anxiety there's usually quite a bit of dark circle lol
"The ONLY reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because I'm still testing this product out a little longer. I've used this product for about 2 weeks now and I absolutely love it! It doesn't smell, its creamy and feels good under my eyes. I actually have noticed a big difference in my under eyes as well! When I used to apply concealer under my eyes, my skin felt dry and hard but after using this, it's a lot softer and more alive looking! It makes my makeup look a whole lot better. I definitely recommend this to everyone :)"
"I have tried so many eye creams all promising to hydrate and smooth wrinkles, and have always been disappointed. But finally, finally, I have found my match for dry and thirsty skin. If you're tired of trying every product on the market, put your roots here and watch your expectations grow. It works!"
I have used other good eye creams. Unfortunately they were oily or greasy and during the night I would rub them into my eyes.... yuk ! This illuminating cream is wonderful... absorbs into the skin with no greasy residue. Leave skin hydrated and it does lighten dark areas over time. LOVE IT !!!!!
This eye cream is nice. It works better than any I've tried in the past.. My range being about 5 different eye creams. I've been using this for almost a month and I notice the dehydration lines underneath my eyes aren't as prominent when wearing makeup. Will definitely continue to use and repurchase!
"I wasn't really expecting much, but to be honest, I wasn't really LOOKING for much. Just a little moisturizing without any thick, greasy residue or irritation. I got what I wanted and more. It really does brighten and adds a great glow. I use it morning and night, and I love it!"
"I wanted to give it some time before I wrote a review so I could see how the product performs. It works very well. I only use it at night, but it has done good things for my eye area. It has taken away the puffiness that I get over night. It has also helped my dark circles to be less noticeable. It has also improved the beginnings of my crow's feet. Oh, and if you are ever in a jam and need an all over facial moisturizer this will do the trick."
I bought this product and gave it a shot but when i would apply it i would feel a stinging sensation which was weird but I ignored it since I thought it was what it was supposed to do. Well i started to notice white patches u der my eyes and my eyes also looking puffy and red like if i had allergies i would put this cream and another on top to see if it will help with the dryness. It didnt still had the dry spots my under eyes look worse than what they did before
Makes my face really soft and less swollen. Also I have very sensitive skin and this does not irritate my skin.
"While this feels very nice on the skin, it hasn't actually done anything for my dark circles or puffiness after 2 weeks of using it, twice a day."
I received that as a gift And the pot was empty.. thats bad because i wanted to try this out.. really disapointed about it..w
"I like this product. It has some great benefits: reducing my puffy eyes, brighter eyes, feels nice, smoothing. I will buy it again."
I bought this a few weeks ago and use it nightly. My under eyes are much brighter and more moisturized. Great product especially at this price.
"I have medium-dark circles under my eyes and I have to say that this cream - which I've used morning and night for a week now - has really reduced the dark color under my eyes. I think for the price and the results, this is an excellent product."
I have only been using it for a couple of nights but I notice my dark circles are a little lighter! It is not greasy and a little goes a long way. I really like it.
I have been using this morning and night for about a month. It has reduced the appearance of those nasty little lines that had sprung up beneath my eyes. This is a great product!
"I received this eye cream for Christmas and I've already noticed a big difference, my dark circles have lightening so much, I can't believe it! I use twice day and will be repurchasing!"
"I bought this a month ago, and took a picture of myself at that time. 1 month later, after using product twice a day, absolutely NO CHANGE. My coconut oil was just as good, if not better."
That's right. Just what the title said. The product was nice. Goes on slightly watery but dries quickly. The packaging looks very nice but it falsely gives the impression you are getting way more product than you actually do.
I bought this about a month ago and it was a great purchase! I am a side sleeper and had started getting wrinkles around my eye on the side I sleep on. This really tightens everything and eliminated bags as well!
I love this product but I feel as if my pot was pretty much empty :( It really helps my under eyes but again I feel like there isn't much and won't last long!
I used this cream and when I got up the next morning holy wow. My eyes were all red and swollen and looked horrible. Has anyone else had a reaction like this?
"I've only been using this for a week, and I can already say that this makes my eyes look a lot less tired. No more heavy concealer to try and hide the dark circles under my eyes!"
"i have bought this and it really compares to some of my high end eye creams, it does it's job but i do not think it goes above and beyond, for the price though it is great"
"I use at night dab a little under my eyes, I've been using for a month now and I see the difference under eye area, my skin is hydrated and smooth, plus my make goes on much smoother i really love this product."
"I had my doubts when I purchased this, but it really works. I put it on every night that I'm not gonna get 8 hours of sleep, and my eyes look and feel great in the morning. So glad I invested in it."
"I can't use 99.99% of the eye creams out there...they sting, and I have to take them off. This is nice and light, doesn't cause any breakouts, and...no sting!"
"Very good product for the eyes -- & nourishing, too. It is great for the sensitive skin around the eyes & pairs well with the night cream & daily moisturizer. Wonderful cruelty-free product!"
Love this! Great texture and smell and have noticed its effects in only a weeks use. Doesn't make my lids greasy and makeup still stays put. Wish there was a bit more product in the jar.
"When I opened the bottle, the half of the contents was on the cap. Besides that issue, the product is overall very good. Already see some good change on my dark circles"
"This is a really good eye cream. I am 58, allergies, puffy eyes . . . this eye cream is illuminating and has good moisture. Going to start taking with me and applying during the day."
I love this eye cream! It feels nice & cool going on and hydrates nicely. Would highly recommend and will repurchase. It beats all of the high end products and I have dry/sensitive skin. No allergies or breakouts!
"Lightweight. Spreads easilY. Hydrates well (the dry feeling doesn't come back throughout the day) works well under makeup. Doesn't irritate my (very sensitive eyes) .I would totally repurchase. Also, packaging feels and looks High en. :)"
Just bought my first jar and ordered 4 more during the 50% off sale. Definitely makes my eyes brighter and smoother. I use it daily and absolutely love it!!!
"The container is huge compared to the actual amount of product you receive. I've used just about all of it and am not that impressed. I won't buy it again, I'm looking for something else."
I like this product. it's good for a light hydration under the eye. I didnt notice anything else change while using the product. But maybe I have not used it enough.
"Without causing any of the skin around or under my eyes to get red. peel, itch, burn, etc. I can tell this will last a long time too. Been using this for several weeks and I really like it. My skin is so temperamental to retinol I just use any eye creams with that in them. This eye cream is gentle on my skin and it hydrates so well."
I used it for several weeks and did not see any improvement.
"I used this product along with the Nourishing Night Cream for approximately one week. The whole time my skin felt dry. Thankfully, my sensitive skin wasn't irritated, but I didn't feel or see any other positive aspects of this products. The circles under my eyes did not appear to improve at all. I stopped using it."
"I was so excited when i first got his eye cream. I only used a little the first time i tried it. The next day I had gotten a stye on my left eye. I waited a week for the stye to completely heal so i could try it again. The next day i had styes in both my eyes!!! And two pimples by my left eye. The studff is so greasy and oily. But hey, it got rid of my dark circles for a day."
I just happened to find this at a Wal mart while on vacation in Myrtle Beach. Started using it right away and within a week I noticed my eye area was brighter. It's now been around a month and I only use it once a day and I still notice brightness around my eyes and even working night shift I still look rested when I get up thanks to this product. Definitely going to try some others from the skin care line.
"I bought this a couple months ago and have recently really started using it, I absolutely love it. It is a very light moisturizer and doesn't irritate my eyes at all. The skin under my eyes is a lot softer as well as brighter and my eye bags don't look to be as puffy!"
I use this as a daytime eyecream because it is so lightweight. It absorbs quickly and sits nicely under makeup. I am over fourty and starting to notice some mild crepiness under my eyes and need something with much stronger anti-aging ingredients than this has for nighttime. This is a great eye cream for young people who aren't yet dealing with aging skin and just need some hydration and prevention.
"I received a sample of this with my last order, and I was so excited about it! It was extremely cooling, which I thoroughly enjoyed, but after the second day of use, I woke up to red puffy eyes. My left under eye area even feels bruised because it's so irritated."
This is the first eye cream I've used that actually gets rid of puffy eyes & dark circles. I've tried other pricier products that did absolutely nothing. I'm sold on this for life...I've even started using it on my neck & face which has made my skin smooth & soft...thank you e.l.f.
"I've tried some more expensive prestige brands and this one beats some of them, it's lightweight and cooling and it actually starts working after the first use. it helps with wrinkles, puffiness and dark circles. The only negative I have to say about it is I wish it came in a little squeeze tube applicator"
"I received a sample of this product with one of my recent purchases, so far I like it. I like how it feels under my eye and how it hydrates my under eye. I was using the one from clinique but I am going to give a try this product buying the full size and see how it goes. So far so good"
"Really nice! This cream is very moisturizing and velvety feeling. It dries quickly (which is perfect for oily skin!) and is a great way to prime around your eyes. The only thing I noticed is that it makes my skin a little itchy (I have very sensitive skin) Regardless, I think its a very nice product."
"This eye cream is very very hydrating for me, which is what i look for in skin care/makeup. My whole face is extremely dry and especially under my eyes into my cheek areas... As soon as i put this on under my eyes after doing my skin care routine, i see a difference in texture, appearance, the feel, everything. you only need the tiniest amount, as alittle goes a very long way. my makeup goes on smoothly and i just really love this product!"
"I've been using this for about a month now, and I have noticed that the circles under my eyes are much lighter. This cream feels so silky when I apply it, and it takes so very little to get coverage on both eyes that this container is going to last me for so long. My eyes are also no longer flaky and dry, and it has just made my eye area feel so soft and smooth."
"I bought this cream with the kit and I am thrilled with it! It works better than the more expensive creams out there, has evened out the sin under my eyes and brightened them. I don't use concealer as much as before. I'll use this forever! Please please keep it around!!!"
"I bought this about 3 weeks ago, and have been using it as part of my eye treatment regimen. It does appear to be reducing the darkish areas under my eyes, but I don't have really dark circles. I do wish that it was also anti-aging and worked on fine lines. For that, I use a different cream."
"This eye cream is basically just a good moisturizer. It doesn't provide the tightening, brightening anti aging benefits of eye creams I'm used to. However for the price and decent ingredients it's not at all bad. In fact I purchased this for a girls sweet sixteen gift (I've been using eye cream since sixteen and will always recommend to girls, a penny of prevention is worth a pound of cure). This product is great at a basic level but not so great if you want to battle the fine lines."
"Have had it for two weeks and I use it twice a day. You don't need more than a pinprick to satisfy your eyes, under, over, and brow bone. The cream soothes and reduces puffiness and darkness, feels like its re-tightening my skin too, but not in an uncomfortable way. No scent, no irritation, no hate! I love this. Will definitely buy once this one's done."
"I received this eye creme about a month ago and I love it! The product is smooth and soft to the touch, no burning sensation as you touch the dry, sensitive skin near the eye. My circles around the eye have lightened and look totally refreshed. Definitely will continue using and can't wait to try the night creme."
"I have tried many eye creams & spent lots of $. Usually I am allergic/or the eye cream is too thick and greasy. This illuminating eye cream is very light and refreshing and has immediate results, best of all its not irritating to my eyes & actually works!"
"I have only been using it in the mornings so far and it works great. I am over 50 and started to notice some little lines especially the side I sleep on, and puffy, but this takes care of that very well. I was cautious because I am allergic to a lot of the expensive things I tried, not sure why but no problem with this cream, love it!"
"I am at the age where I have more than dark circles under my eyes, but I feel I have had the problem for a while. Over the years I've tried things and really didn't see any improvement. However, I have had this product for about a week and I haven't even been that diligent in using it and I already see a significant difference under my eyes. I am quite impressed and now will use it as directed."
"I really like this, especially for the price. The container is a lot bigger than I thought it would be and after trying it I will defiantly repurchase. It feels so hydrating, I can feel the puffiness around my eyes slowly go down. This could also serve as a good moisturizer. The hydration is amazing."
"So I was shocked at how fast it diminished my dark circles. My mom and my best friend even noticed immediately. I used it over night with the night cream, and I used a light coat before applying makeup. I noticed I didn't have to use as much concealer as I usually do. So that makes me happy. Its a good price and I love the ingredients. Jojoba, Vitamin E, and Cucumber to soothe and protect the delicate skin area around the eyes. It's also rich in antioxidants Shea Butter and Green Tea."
"great and complete package, i just added the toner to it . so that my skin care routine is completed"
"It's decent. Nice moisturizer, but I don't see how it's Illuminating"
I am a 55 year old with baggy under eye. this product hydrates and brightens the under eye so I don't look old and tired all the time. I love this
"I have been using it a few months , and I can tell a big difference. My eyes are not puffy like always and the dark circles are alot lighter."
I started using this a couple days ago and it helps keeping my eyes hydrated and it minimizes the fine lines I used to see underneath my foundation.
I use this at night mostly and when I wake up I notice a difference in my dark circles. It's not a huge difference but my eyes do look brighter.
If you are prone to eczema this product may not be for you. Using this cream quickly made me develop eczema where I had applied it.
"i used every single day, just to prepare por my daily make up, but it wont works for extra full hydration for the night!"
"After about a week my eyes actually started to burn and become irritated, even made my concealer under my eyes crease really bad. Save your money"
"A little thin, but great for moisturizing the eye area."
I love the feel of this cream and really felt it helped open up my eyes.
"Very moisturizing, but I had breakouts around my eyes. I'm going to try a different one."
Affordable and effective! Light and not at all heavy so great for the eye area.
I love this eye cream! It feels so silky and smooth. It just glides on and my eyes look smoother and feel just wonderful. This is definitely a keeper!
"I have tried several different eye creams, and this is the one I will go back to. It feels great, moisturizes well, is very gentle for my sensitive skin, and helps with the bags under my eyes. There is no smell or odor, either, which I appreciate."
Used once and my dark circles look ten times better no joke!! Thank you being a mom is super tiring and stressful and this makes me feel way more confident!
"This is a great eye cream! It feels luxurious and very hydrating. My skin seems so much brighter. I also noticed after using this, my concealer does not crease throughout the day. Highly recommended."
I was send this a a gift to try. I used this for only a week and I was pleasantly surprised by how quick it brightened & smoothed out fines lines. It but s perfect for sensitive skin. I will definitely be adding this to my daily sky nacre regimen!
i got a small sample packet in my latest elf package. I tried it and it was so soft on the skin. It was hydrating and works for my skin. I will definitely purchase in the near future.
I bought this product about a week ago and I love this it helps with my purple dark spots I layer it with other products and I use it on its own as well I'm so happy with this product I've already recommended this to my mom
Worth every penny! one of best eye cream products ive used ever. found something great for an even greater price- im sticking with it! leaves eye area moist and abosrbs well. does what it is supposed to do!
"this is great! It is light wight but very moisturizing. I don't really see any thing ""Illuminating"". But other than that I love this! I think it might be my new favorite. but the real test will be how it holds up during the winter."
"I can put this on my lower and upper lids and it goes on silky smooth. It also doesn't irritate, which is a plus for my sensitive area. Another great product from ELF. Thanks!!"
I have used many eye creams through out my years and always felt that they made no difference. Not only do I see a difference with this product the cost of it is out of this world!! I highly recommend this product.
"I've used this product for two weeks. It has noticeably reduced the puffiness under my eyes. My dark circles are less dark, as well. So far the best eye cream I've used. The price makes it even better!"
"I had high hopes for this eye cream. It has good reviews, it smells nice, and it's pretty affordable. However, my expectations were shattered, and not in a good way."
"This cream does nothing for dark circles. Zip, nada, zilch. It doesn't help concealer go on--rather, it made it look scaly. In a few hours, it puffed up my undereye area, but only right under the lash line, leaving me with deep creases that no concealer would fix."
"Bought this a while ago and finally got around to using it. The first few times were okay, but then it started burning my undereye area really badly. I had to wash it off and it still stung; it hurt less when I put ice on though. Be careful with this. If it starts to burn, wipe it off right away. Not worth it."
The light reflecting qualities really minimizes dark circles even without makeup. The product also seems to reduce the appearance of under eye bags as well. The best part is you only need to use the tiniest amount. I anticipate this product will last a very long time.
"I have very sensitive skin and I am afraid to put products on it because I don't want to break out. I tried this under eye cream and the first night the bags were a little darker. The second time I used it, it was getting lighter and lighter. By the end of the week my dark circles were gone. I love this product and recommend it to anyone, but you do have to stick with the routine. Once in the morning and once before you go to sleep! Then you will get great results. Make sure you don't rub it on your eyes and you tap it all over your eye area."
I love this product! It last a long time and you only need a little. I put it on every morning and it leaves me feeling awake and hydrated. I forgot to put it on for a couple of days and I realized the skin around my eyes were getting dry like they used too and after two days going back to it the dry patches are gone. I recommend if you just need a good wake up and nice hydrating eye cream. Recommend.
"For some reason, I got this free from e.l.f., and was very pleased with this product. I use it both before my makeup (really helps to smooth out my conceal and stop it from creasing) as well as before I go to bed. I would say it helped with some of my dark circles but not all, but definitely does what it claims. It has lasted me a few months and will definitely be repurchasing when I am completely out."
"E.L.F sent me a sample of this product, I usually am very weary about my skin care routine and I almost didn't try it but this is an amazing product. It does an amazing job at reducing the puffiness that my eyes are susceptible to when I wake up in the morning. I use it twice a day (day/night) and I will definitely be purchasing more."
"I've been using this in the morning for a few weeks now, and not much has changed. I bought this in hopes of reducing the color of my dark circles, which turned out to not be the case. The only thing it really does is refresh the under-eye area, not much else. I also don't like that it comes in jar because that means germs from your hands get in there and end up on your face. I will continue using it until it runs out, but I will not purchase again. One upside is that a little goes a long way."
"Reduces puffy eyes and dark circles effectively. I have very sensitive skin and this did not bother me at all, sunk in within ten minutes and isn't greasy. As for the amount, you barely need any on the tip of your finger to use on your entire eye area. It spreads nicely and I am glad I purchased it"
"I like this product because it's not greasy under my yes. As far as my dark circles, I did notice an improvement with this but not significant enough that I would mark this as my holy grail eye product. It is in fact very hydrating. My eyes have been less puffy lately hitch is a big problem for me. Would repurchase.(I have normal/dry skin)"
"I pre ordered this eye cream before it came out because I love elf products. I honestly was not expecting much, but I'm only 22 and I do not suffer from dark circles or puffiness under the eyes. I just wanted a moisturizing eye cream that would help prevent creasing of concealer under my eyes. This feels so good when you put it on. I let it sit for a while before moisturizing the rest of my face and I have seen a significant difference in my concealer. For the price, I'm highly satisfied."
"I love this eye cream! It feels nice and cool going on, it's not greasy at all and makeup applies great over top of it. I have also noticed my under eyes are less puffy since using this product (I've been using it every day and again at night since I received it about 2.5 weeks ago). Will definitely repurchase and I'd recommend it to anyone interested in trying a new eye cream."
This is my go to under my makeup. It plumps my under eye
"This eyecream stings the skin under my eyes, it hurts."
"Long lasting, as in quantity received, and feels amazing!"
"I really wanted to love his eye cream but alas, burned my skin. I had to return. So sad."
I love how smooth it goes onto the eye area. I have noticed a big difference in the crows feet. I love this stuff!
When i used this product the dark circles were increased and it made my eyes really dark. Please save your money.
"I recibed a sample with my last purshes and i am in love, this cream make my under eyes look so smooth and relax, im just waitting for my income this month to buy it !! I love elf products ... thaks"
"I got this when they were launching it, I don't see any difference. I don't know what it is supposed to do, because it hasn't done anything. I love my ELF products, but this will not be one of my regularpurchases."
I've used this product a few week and it's doesn't really make the dark circles disappear although I have noticed they're not that dark anymore. This product is amazing for moisturizing around the eyes. And it's light weight.
"This is good for moisturizing and conditioning the eye area, but that's about it. It doesn't do much for undereye circles or puffiness at all... you will have better luck with a gel product that dispenses with a metal rollerball than you with this."
"My sister introduced me to this magnificent eye cream and now it's a product that O use every day. It's lightweight, non-greasy and lasts all day long."
"I must let you know, this is the only eye cream I have ever used, but I still love it. I definitely notice a different on nights I forget to apply it. It feels great, has beautiful packaging, and helps lighten my dark circles for sure."
"I was really excited to get a night eye cream but was not impressed with the results. Did cause slight burning after use, dont know if that was apart of the product but i do not look forward to using it again.."
"This is the best eye cream I have ever used, even better than the more expensive brands in my opinion. It really gives my eyes a less tired and ""illuminated"" look. Just a little bit goes a long way. Love it!"
"Received my eye cream this week, and after the first use my eyes were brighter and darkness was faded. It provides wonderful hydration as well. Ultra luxurious and scent free- I highly recommend this product. Can't wait to try more!"
This is a really silky and moisturizing eye cream. I really like the consistency and it really helps aging under eyes stay moist. The packaging is really sleek too.
This is a lightweight cream that absorbs quickly and feels fantastic around my eyes. I've used it for almost a week and have notice less puffiness and darkness around my eyes. Great product.
"I have been using this for a week now and the texture and look of my skin is wonderful. I love the fact that there is no scent, my Loreal worked great but I couldn't take the smell. Will definitely be getting the daily moisturizer too."
"I had gotten this as a sample years ago and never thought anything of it, when I decided to purchase it I couldn't be happier. It has no scent and feels so refreshing and looks so glowy and dewy!! I woke up with the most hydrated under eyes and eyelids. I suffer for extremely dry sensitive skin and I adore this product!!! I will definitely repurchase this for years to come!"
"This reminds me so much of the Tacha Water cream. It feels exactly the same and turns into almost a watery light liquid that you can easily spread across your eyes without tugging on the delicate skin too hard. I love it, and my fine lines stay away since they are moisturized. LOVE it, getting another jar."
this is one of those products that won't disappoint you. it feels so refreshing when i apply it and it is super lightweight and soft. i do notice a beautiful brightening effect why i use before makeup. it is not the best in the world but for ten dollars you really can't get better. but warning if you accidentally get some in your eye it for me personally burned sooooo bad.
"I wish there was more in the container because it is awesome! Super soft, applies easier, doesn't wear off easily, works, and doesn't make me feel heavy or greasy. My eyes totally feel woken up! A little goes a super long way, so don't be worried about the size of the container! You only need a dab of it and it works!"
I love to use this all over my face as moisturizer after i wash my face before I put on makeup. It is so hydrating and lasts a very long time. I've had mine for at least three months. This is very lightweight and very hydrating. It also doesn't aggravate my sensitive skin.
I love eye cream and have tried a lot of drug store brands. This is one of my faves. I have been using it for over a month and I can noticeably tell a difference in my appearance. I look more awake and my skin is brighter. Super happy with the results. I put it on morning and night and sometimes in between! I love the cool feel of the product. A little goes a long way but there is also not a whole lot in the pot. The packaging is a little deceiving.
"I ordered this because I was in line at Old Navy, and this was in one of those quick purchase ben's. I am a lady of a particular age, and I was seeing my eyes get a little puffy and baggy. Out of all the other products I've tried, this has been the most satisfying and the cheapest. Those other high priced eye creams do not do half as good of a job as this eye cream. Awesome product!!!"
"I bought this two weeks ago, I am fan of this product now. My eye lids look healthy and bright now, before they were really dry and flacky all the time. lv this cream its really cheap as compared to other eye creams. It's my first time I am trying elf products and I really like there products."
"Got this as a free gift. The pot was less than half-full, and honestly, it's just too light for me to notice a difference. It does have a nice cooling sensation when I pat it under my eyelids, but I'm not sure I notice a difference, and it's definitely too light/watery for me to use as a primer for under eye concealer."
"I was hesitant to try this because I have very sensitive skin, but got a free sample with my last order and was pleasantly surprised. After only 2 uses I can see a great improvement in the fine lines around my eyes. It glides on smooth and absorbs quickly. Does not do anything for dark under eye circle, but what does."
Ive been using this since Christmas and I can say this product works well in the morning to give your eyes that big drink of water they need. This product is very lightweight and really helps hydrate the undereye area. I still have dark circles but my eyes are not as puffy. Most of all it feels so good. Helps my concelear look great. Compared to when i didnt use it. Try it ladies.
"I've been using this product for over a week now, and I can tell a huge difference in my eyes. Because of college I do not get much sleep. But when I put this stuff on my eyes before bed and after a shower my eyes look so much better. And it has been helping with my bags under them. I use a q-tip to make the product last longer, and you really do not need a lot. I was weary on using this product, but now I am interested in the rest of the E.L.F. skincare line."
I honestly see a difference in my under eyes. I have been using this cream for 2 weeks now morning and night. I never had dark citcled per say but I did have discolortion. This eye cream really does illuminate and add a nice glow. Will definitely purchase again.
Really helps with dark circles . Inise twice a day and I really like it
Got a sample a while ago and can't wait to buy the actual product. Feels amazing
I absolutely love how this brightens up the eye area. This is now my go to eye cream!
Love it great for puffy eyes. I use it every night with my face cream
This is the best eye cream I have found that doesn't make my eyes feel goopy!
"I have bought this before, and I liked it. So I ordered some more. Well my order arrived today. And guess what wasn't in the box?"
THIS PRODUCT!
I got a sample size of this product. From the first day I saw improvements. It reduced the appearance of puffiness under my eye.
"I have dry and sensitive under eye area an this "" Illuminating eye cream"" when I applied literally burn my eyes, I don't recommend!"
I liked this product from when I purchased this m within the year off of the website. I was about to but again until I researched the ingredient butylene glycol. The second highest ingredient in the product. Now that I won't ever but this again.
Bought this a month ago and used it twice daily for two weeks and did not see any change in my under eye area. It also has very little product. Would not reccomend purchasing.
I love the packaging. It looks like high end skin care and feels amazing on my eyes. I have only been using it for a week. I'm hoping for good results.
"this eye cream is pure magic it really does moisturize the under eyes as well as giving such beautiful glowing effect , clearly recommend this to anyone thats looking for an undereye cream."
"I was not a fan of this product because honestly, I didn't even notice a difference after using it for two weeks straight. I would recommend just getting the night cream.. more product and same affect."
I am amazed at how well it brightens. After 4 days my dark circles are pretty much gone. I have gone from having to pack on foundation and concelor to hide the circles to maybe a light application for a special occasion.
"This eye cream makes my eyes feel so supple and nourished and awake. The jar is huge and you barely need to use any product! It isnt super thick, pretty thin liquidy cream but it works for me."
"I received a sample of this, and upon using it on my undereye area, it made my skin burn. I do not have overly sensitive skin, so I was surprised and disappointed. I did not have any skin damage, but this stuff is too strong for an eye cream."
I bought this product on a whim. I have dark circles under my eyes and fine lines. This is very light and hydrating. I use this twice a day as recommended. I feel like this is helping with dark circles. Recommended
Most eye creams irritate my eyes and they look worse in the morning! The first day using it I woke up to less puffiness and no irritation! Can't go wrong with this under eye cream!
I have a terrible time with puffiness and darkness under my eyes. Using this product religiously has decreased both significantly and I look younger. I am happy with the outcome of using this product.
"I have been using the eye cream for a full week, and my eyes haven't looked better. I reduced dramatically the dark circles under my eyes. I even got my dad one and he loves it!"
"It is very easy to apply, it is evry lightweight and you can really feel your eyes moisturized. The only disappointment, is that the bottle comes almost half empty!!"
"Nope, do not try this if your skin is sensitive. I tried the sample they gave me the night before a big event and woke up to red puffy eyes that were weirdly crusted and even my eyes lids had a rash on them. My eyes were burning, red and felt heavy, they were not illuminated and less puffy. I will absolutely never use this again, I want my money back even if I didn't actually pay for it. Free isn't even worth it!"
This product is a really good value because a little goes a long way. It does really moisturize and my skin absorbs the product easily. My concealer still creases even after using this product (I realize this product doesn't claim to help that). I have some small eye wrinkles and have noticed no difference in those. I also don't notice that my dark circles are any less noticeable or that my skin looks brighter. It also burns the heck out of my under eyes most of the time given I have sensitive skin. quite a bummer.
"I bought this recently, and was using it twice daily as directed for a couple of weeks. It makes my under eye area very puffy and does not seem to reduce dark circles or brighten. I do have sensitive skin so maybe that is why the puffiness happened? The cream is also very heavy feeling. I hate to throw it away for the price but don't want to keep using it either. Disappointed. Might give it another try but not sure."
"I normally love every e.l.f. product and it's kind of rare that there's one that I don't like but this one unfortunately is not for me. I've tried using it several times and each time I used it, it caused red rashy spots under my eyes. I have very sensitive skin and have never had an e.l.f. product cause a skin problem but every time I used this it caused a breakout. It feels soothing to apply but when I woke up in the morning I had spots. I also didn't notice any ""illumination"" or reduction in puffiness or fine lines. Sigh..."
"I was happy with the product. The price is great especially because it is formulated with no parabens, sulfates, and phthalates. I like the texture. It really didn't have a strong scent. My only negative comment about this product was that I really didn't see any difference in the look of my skin."
Ive been using this for the last 3 nights and i get a burning sensation the next in my eyes...
This is a go to eye cream. Great for my sensitive skin and a little goes a long way
Feels great and cooling going on. Makeup glides on smoothly
"I bought this product a couple days ago and this product is amazing. I feel so young, fresh, and happy. No stressing about dark circles after this!"
"This has been great for my ""mature"" eyes! I needed some extra moisture, especially under the eye and this cream really does the trick!!"
"I am on my second jar of this cream. Will continue to re-purchase this forever.....just a solid, no frills eye cream that works!"
I have terrible dark circles underneath my eyes and this product has truly been a blessing. I will be buying this again!
This felt amazing on my eyes. It feels good on the eyes after a long day at work. It cools and brightens.
"I use this all the time! More than other expensive ones I've bought in the past. I really like how it feels. And, it already seems to be working!"
This was sent to me by Influenster and elf and I'm so happy they did. I love this mask. It makes my skin so soft and flawless. Thank you and I definitely will be buying this now!
love everything from your skin care lines but this one burned my under eyes and caused irritation and what looked like micro white heads under my eyes
I have been using is for a few weeks and my eyes do look less puffy and purple. I use it both morning and night. It's not amazing but a little goes a long way and you can see a difference. Good for the price.
"I had high hopes for this product however, I didnt see any improvement"
I used this once four days ago and I broke out in hives and my eyes are itchy. not for me.
I got this a couple weeks ago and I love it. It has helped alot with under my eyes.
It says dab it on the brow bone and below the lower lid. Should I put this on the eyelid itself?
My dark circles are getting smaller and lighter in just a week!
I've been using this product for 2 weeks and didn't see a difference.
Really silky and moisturizing eye cream! im so happy with the results!
This is not moisturizing at all! It feels super watery/too light to even recommend to someone who wants a light eye cream. Waste of money for sure!
My undereyes no longer make me look constantly tired. It started working where it was a noticeable difference in about 6 days which is amazing
"It seems to be working great, but the tiny amount i received was a bit off putting seeing how i bought it and didnt receive it as a sample..."
"ive been using this for about 2.5 months, and still have dark circles under and around my eyes.."
I apply under my eyes and then 20 minutes later my eyes was swallowing and my eye was red
I got this in a beauty bundle. I don't really feel like it did anything wonderful.
"I bough this eye cream a few weeks ago, while traveling."
At first my eyes would burn but I don't experience that anymore and I really like using it.
I love this product. It definitely reduced my dark circles. I recommend if you have dark circle.
