"Have only been using e.l.f. Nourishing Night Cream for one week, but boy, can I tell the difference. A store manager and I were discussing grandchildren and I told him I had five and two great grandchildren. He was floored when I told him I was one year away from eighty! He thought I was in my sixties. Well, I told him I'd take his opinion any day!! Thanks e.l.f.."
"I bought this, along with a few other e.l.f. products just 3 days ago, switching from a big brand because I wasn't happy with the results. After just 3 days of use, my skin feels AMAZING all day and night. Lightweight, makes my skin feel softer than my 15 year olds, and I'm almost 40. GREAT product!"
"I have had this for a while therefore feel able to leave a full review! I use this after toning and it feels incredible to put on. A little goes a really long way and I feel as though I haven't even touched the surface. What do I love most about it? I wake up and my skin feels the same as when I put it on the night before. Moisturised, plump and supple. It is my must have and allows me to avoid putting more product on in the morning. Amazing value for a seriously great product."
"I have very dry, sensitive skin and this night cream leaves my face hydrated & supple from night until morning."
I love this really helps my skin glow but for some reason mines turned brown and I'm not sure why
"Love this cream! Was a bit hesitant because I have somewhat oily skin, sometimes dry in the winter, but although this is nourishing it is not too heavy. Light scent, and makes my skin look plump (in a good way)!"
"Moisturizing. Lightweight. Thinner in consistancy. Has a moderately oily slip to it. Nice packaging; similar to the Hello! Hydration Face Cream. Not a fan of its' current scent. Don't know how to describe the scent. However, I wished it smelled like the Hello! Hydration Face Cream."
I bought this a few weeks ago and I LOVE it!! I had some minor breakouts and was needing a moisturizer for my night routine and if i use it i avoid breakouts feels a lil oily though)
"I have never used any kind of moisturizer due to acne. I took a chance and started using this about a month ago and I've noticed my pores are way less noticeable, skin tone is alot more even, and my skin is firmer."
I've never used a face cream before. So I bought this as I'm going to try and mess around with make up for the first time around and thought I'd need something to help hydrate my skin as I'll be washing my face more often and my skin can already be sort of dry and rough after cleansing. The very first use made my skin instantly feel so much softer and look radiant! I honestly can't believe I've never used anything like this before now (I'm 26)!
i bought this cream about 1 month ago and it has made my skin so happy! i typically have oily skin but lately my skin has been dry and peeling so when i started using this it brought back moisture to my face.
"This is a rich, creamy night cream, but it isn't heavy on my skin. I appreciate how light it is given the fact that i layer with the hydrating serum in this collection."
"This is an average night cream. It did moisturize my face, which is great, but it said that it would give this great glowing finish and make you look awake in the morning which it didn't. i'll be very straight with you guys, it moisturized which is nice, but didn't do anything more than that"
"I've had this cream for a few months ( a little goes a long way) and my skin feels fantastic. It goes on super smooth and when I wake up my skin is soft and hydrated. I have super oily skin that's sometimes sensitive, so I was worried at first thinking it could make me breakout. I was pleasantly surprised and now I'm excited to try more of Elfs skincare line!"
"I am a huge ELF fan, I almost exclusively wear ELF products and I love their illuminating eye cream but this ""Nourishing Night Cream"" was a bust for me. I applied it and it looked and felt creamy but within 30 minutes I was applying it again because my skin felt more dry then before I put it on the first time!! I love *most* ELF products but not this one!"
"I recently bought this night cream, and was nervous to try it because I have sensitive skin. I have also not used a night cream before. I really love it. It does not hurt my skin at all or cause a reaction. I feel like my skin is more hydrated and youthful already. I will buy more and feel like this will become a go to."
"I don't write reviews very often, but this product is amazing! I received it in the mail yesterday, and used it last night. I was concerned about it making my skin oily, since I have very combination skin. with a few very dry flaky patches on my face, but my forehead and nose get oily very quickly as well. I also have very sensitive skin and prone to breakouts. I used it last night and woke up this morning with very smooth skin, and not oily!"
This product is great. It makes your skin feels so soft and smooth. I use the daily facial cleanser with the daily moisturizer and this together is amazing. it doesn't make your face feel heavy or greasy at all. Once you try it you're going to be hooked onto it.
I'm not one to write reviews on things unless I really hate it or love it and I seriously love it!! I have really oily skin so finding something that doesn't make my face look greasy is hard but this doesn't at all. My face now always looks healthy and glowing that I almost never want to put makeup on it.
"I have terrible eczema which would leave my face dry and scaly, with puffy bright red marks in the morning no matter how much I moisturized the night before. I have been using this product for a few weeks now and I have loved it from day one. It's extremely lightweight and silky. It dries to a velvety finish. It doesn't irritate my sensitive skin nor wear ff during the night. My skin hasn't looked this good in years."
"I have been using this as part of a new routine for almost a week now and I love it! I have very oily skin. My old routine (which was recommended by my dermatologist) made my skin a lot more oily (it looked like I had been standing over a fryer all day). After switching daily face wash, applying ELFs Daily Moisturizer every morning, and applying the night cream every night my face looks refreshed every day and does not look oily at ALL!!"
"I must be allergic to something in this. I've never been allergic to any cream of makeup in the past. At first it only made my face turn red, but after a few days it looked more like a rash and was causing me to get little breakouts. I'm someone with very clear, normal type skin. It was too oily for me."
Bought this a few weeks ago and absolutely love it! My skin is prone to breakouts and I don't really remember the last time my skin was this clear. I use it with the Daily Cleanser and it's absolutely perfect! These are the first products that have ever worked this well on my skin. Love e.l.f. products!
I was really surprised how good this cream is...I could still feel it on my face when I got up the next morning...and I mean in a good way..just a slight moisture veil left from applying it hours before. Considering the price...it is better than most of my more exspensive moisturizers..way to go e.l.f....you guys are really on top of the game!
"I was really iffy about the elf skincare line because I have very sensitive skin, plus I am very oily. But I decided to give this a try. I've had a great experience so far. It's very very smooth on the skin, and the scent is light, not irritating. My skin has not reacted negatively. It doesn't leave a super oily finish, it's a nice amount of dewiness (coming from a person who has super oily skin). Very impressed, & is now one of my new favorites! Now interested in trying more of their skincare products. :)"
"I use this every night after I do my whole skincare shebang, and its really nice on the skin. I wouldn't say it helps with acne or makes my skin incredibly glowy or firm or anything special. however, it is still very hydrating for my dry skin and isn't too hard on the wallet. will probably repurchase :)"
"First impressions, i really like this cream. I dont know if its a good thing but its alot more lightweight than other nightcreams i have used in the past. It is also alot less oily. I have dry skin so i dont know how well it will moisturize but i am pretty sure it wont break me out from excess oil. i dont however like the lines product smell. Other than that I am really happy with this product overall"
"I preordered this item for the launch of the skincare line. It came sometime in the middle of February or closer to the end. I did not like how it felt from the beginning. It seemed too sticky and that it just wasn't absorbing into the skin. Since these things take a while to notice any change I continued to use the product until about a week ago. For me, it didn't do what it claimed to do. I felt like it did nothing at all for me. Pretty disappointing. I did not use any other skincare products on the same area at the same time as this."
I bought this and it is wonderful. My skin is very sensitive and this has no irritation and makes my skin so soft and not oily.
I have been looking for a product that as good on my skin! I just received it yesterday and no complaints! My face this morning already looked glittering and fresh!! Can not wait to try the other products!
I was so scared to try this because I have Rosacea and so many things make me break out! But this was one of the best moisturizers I tried! Makes my skin SO SOFT! Waiting for my regular moisturizer to run out to try the day time one!
i bought this a month ago and i really liked it at first because it made my skin really soft but recently when i've been usuing it my skin peels & is super dry
I am on my second jar of this! I love it! Very moisturizing and not greasy at all. Just what my skin needs! I have sensitive skin so I am happy to find a night cream that doesn't cause a breakout.
"This product came in the skin care set I bought a while back when it was first released. Every time I wake up after applying this the night before, I always feel the need to tell people to touch my face."
"I was a little worried about a using this, mainly because I naturally have very oily skin. Woke up the next morning and no greasiness or oily skin at all! And my face was the smoothest its ever been. Great product."
"Irritated and caused a lot of redness all across my nose and cheek areas. I am sure the product could work for other people, however, if you have sensitive skin like me I would not recommend this product."
Everytime I use this product it makes my skin extremely itchy and uncomfortable right away. Even touching my face causes it to itch and it lasts a few days. I feel like it works well but I just can't stand using it due to the itch.
IT makes my whole face feel so good. I have been using it fo well over a year and can tell a difference in my skin texture and no new ageing lines. I'm 57 so lets be true lines are there .Will contune to buy it.
I have never been allergic to any cosmetics before I used this night cream. It burned my skin and I woke up to my eyes being so puffy I could hardly see and my forehead was irritated. Very disappointed. I now have scaly dry itchy irritated red skin.
I've been using this for about 2 weeks and I do use it over night...when I wake up my skin is silky soft. I have acne scars ring and it soothes the redness! 5 stars and I will be re purchasing!=)
"Omg!! I love this product sooo much! I have very dry skin, so I gave this a try and it did not disappoint! My skin feel so moisturized in the morning. Love it! Also, a little goes a long way !"
After one week of using it I have seen some improvements with my skin. I have very sensitive skin and it's hard to find something that works. I'll be buying more once I'm done.
"I've been using this every night for two weeks and when I wake up in the morning, my face just feels more moisturized and soft. It feels a little oily when first applied and I use it very sparingly, but is soaks in rather quick. Smells good."
"I bought the night cream after using & loving the hydrating lotion & eye cream. It's just as amazing. Now I'm ready to buy the serum, I have to try products gradually due to allergies. There are no allergies with these products, I'm very happy!"
"More than what I was expecting. Easy to apply, it is not greasy at all, and very refreshing. Been using for over a week and feels good and I like what I see in the mirrow everyday :)"
"I have been using this for a week now and the texture and look of my skin is wonderful. I love the fact that there is no scent, my Loreal worked great but I couldn't take the smell. Will definitely be getting the daily moisturizer too."
"I bought this a week ago and so far my skin has never felt softer or smoother. When I go to sleep, my skin feels so plush. Good moisturizer for its inexpensive price!"
"I just received this yesterday so I will continue to use it and see if it is just my face reacting negatively, but I noticed when I applied it at night, it made my face feel really hot. Not so much burning but just very warm. It eventually went away but still wasn't a fun experience. This also didn't really change the way I woke up, it just moisturized my face like any regular moisturizer. Wasn't terrible, wasn't great. I probably won't be buying this again but I will continue to use it unless my face reacts negatively again."
"I just purchased this item and started using it 3 days ago however, the last 3 times I've used it my skin begins to burn almost immediately after rubbing it on. Is this normal? It's also made me break out a little but the burning is really bad! Anyone have the same problem? Other than that it's really good."
I heard a few raving reviews for this product so I bought it. A few nights ago I tried it and my skin started burning! I thought it was a fluke so I tried it 2-3 more times and the same thing happened! I also now have a few acne breakouts and I have never had acne!
"It's a shame I cant find this at Target anymore. I love this face cream. I use to try from Lancome to Neutrogena, and everything in the middle I travel around the world I tried Italian creams, french..etc. This lotion really makes a difference. It give back the humidity of my skin. And I'm living in California now, ( high-desert ) where you have to fight against dry weather. PS. I'm buying this on Internet, because I been trying to buy it the last month...on Target and they dont have it anymore. Its a shame !"
"I cannot believe how impressed I am with this moisturizer, I find myself reaching for this more than my beloved L'Occitant moisturizer from their Devine line. I'm looking forward to trying the cleaner. I love how it smells and feels on my skin, it doesn't just sit on my skin, I can't stop touching my face."
"I bought this to hopefully help out my combination skin that gets very dry in my TV zone during winter. It's been just perfect! It's very light feeling, but you can feel it sinking into your skin - not just sitting on top. I'm only giving it a 4 star because I want the jar to contain more product or start offering larger sizes."
"I have used this cream all summer and I love it. It does not feel greasy to me and is very light on my skin, easy to rub in. I really can't smell it unless I stick my whole nose in the container, and I can't smell it on my face. But most importantly, it works! My skin definitely does feel refreshed in the morning after I put it on at night. And it lasts a long time; like I said, I got it at the beginning of the summer and it is now September and I still have a considerable amount left."
I was skeptical as I have huge dark circles and have tried many expensive creams to no avail. I also am starting to get fine lines as I am now 40. Using this for a month I see that the circles seemed lessened and the fine lines are fading. My skin has never looked better since starting the elf regimen.
"I have been looking for a night time moisturizer, but could not choose. Once elf decided to launch their skin care products, I decided to try it since I love basically everything elf has. I am in love with this moisturizer. It is so hydrating leave my skin smooth and no dry patches. I want to get the daily moisturizer but it does not have spf in it. Once you guys get a day time moisturizer with spf, believe it I am buying it."
"First off, THIS DOESNT BREAK ME OUT!!! More moisturizers than not tend to break me out so I was thrilled to find that I can use this one worry free(: this soaks nicely into my skin throughout the nice and I wake up in the morning with my skin feeling nice. I will definitely reuse / repurchase this night cream!"
"I was skeptical at first because I have very combination skin and was worried that I would feel too greasy when I woke up in the morning. However, my skin is soft and I have a nice glow in the morning. Thank you Elf! I couldn't be happier with my product."
I expected this to be greasy but it is absolutely not and completely amazing. It makes your skin feel silky smooth and you wake up the next day with baby soft skin! I would actually compare this to my Clinique Moisture Surge Intense Cream. This product is fantastic for the price!
"So I have really oily skin, and sometimes oddly, my skin dries out by the time I wake up. It kept my face nourished. I also really love the ingredients. Jojoba, Aloe, Vitamin E, and cucumber. Plus antioxidants. It wasn't heavy where it feels thick and greasy, and it wasn't thin. I also used the eye cream over night and loved it with the night cream."
I received this yesterday! As I was opening it the top white container came off the top clear blue top. Luckily it still screws on slightly shut but leaks lotion out of it. As for the product inside it is very moisturizing and not too greasy on the skin. Really absorbed into my skin. So far so good!
"I'm 51, and found this night cream to work really well, at a reasonable price."
I've been using this night cream for about a month along with the daily moisturizer and my skin is so soft! It's not oily and it's lightweight.
It's light enough to use every night. Cute packaging. I would repurchase. I don't get dry spots or red blemishes like I usually find with others.
I started usng this a week ago. smells and feels good going on. i woke with a rash all over my face.
I was looking for a heavier night cream during the harsh winter and this stuff is AWESOME! Buying another jar RIGHT NOW!
I've been using this nightly since receiving it a week ago and I can really tell a difference in my skin in the morning. Very dewy and mousturized.
This is just an ok night cream. It didn't feel nourishing. It felt drying after I applied. Maybe this is better for oily and normal skin. I had no sensitivities to it.
I recieved this for free when I ordered a while back! I use it every night. It is light weight and doesn't clog my pores. I will be purchasing when this one is almost empty!
This really moisturizes my skin and leaves it baby soft in the morning. It smells great and doesn't feel oily/sticky. And there is so much product! The jar is huge and costs 80% less than the tiny jar moisturizers!
"great basic night cream. moisturizing and soothe. but one thing, after applying, I blot the excess with blotting paper, otherwise it will give a greasy feel, but if that doesn't bother you, this is a very good night cream, for the price."
"I had high hopes for this cream, but i find myself underwhelmed. I had some minor irritation five minutes after applying for the three nights I attempted to use it, and woke up with greasy skin. It's just not for me I guess."
Seriously Elf did amazing with this line. The night cream is a thicker all over face moisturizer but go on the skin so light weight and non oily. The best night cream I have ever experienced.
"I bought this item a few weeks ago, and I am beyond pleased! I have sensitive skin, and it is so gentle. It is the perfect night cream! Highly recommend!"
"This cream goes on very well, and not oily. A small amount covers your whole face. I have bought my second jar already, and will use it again. The best night cream I have bought so far."
"I'm almost 40 and knew I should be moisturizing my skin more often, I love all my other elf products so I gave this a try and couldn't be happier with how it makes my skin feel. It makes it very soft and supple. Highly recommend it."
I got this about 3 weeks ago and have been using it faithfully every night on a clean face with mature skin. Am NOT crazy about the smell but love waking up to a soft non-oily face.. Absolutely recommend this!
"Overall this product definitely does its job but if you have extremely sensitive skin like me, you might not have good results. This product made me break out more than I ever have which is honestly a big shame because it is super super moisturizing and the first few days I used it my skin felt great! So if you don't have sensitive skin I would definitely recommend but if you have sensitive skin, I would steer clear of this product. The reason I'm giving it three stars is because it is a super good product, but it made me break out."
I originally got this as an add on item and I love it so much. I wake up feeling refreshed and hydrated its a MUST have product. It smells amazing and feels amazing.Truley nourishing and relaxing to the skin. I wake up and feel like I already have primer on and Im ready to put on my makeup. AMAZING skin care product for an AMAZING price. MUST HAVE ITEM!!!!!!
"I have been using this for 3 weeks and it is amazing! I have very dry skin and have tried many many moisturizers and this feels like a luxury cream. Most moisturizers sink right in but then my skin feels dry again, this one still feels hydrating even after sinking in. I am obsessed."
"I have combination skin that's prone to breakouts, so I also use a lot of acne products that in turn dry my face out until it flakes. It's embarrassing and unattractive. I bought this and started using it at night and I wake up with the softest skin I have ever had, and my face heals better from the acne scars since it's retaining it's moisture. This is an amazing for amazing very delightful price."
"Now I know, compared to other elf products it's pricy, but Ithe is worth the splurge. I promise."
"It's hard to find a night cream that is fragrance free. I have chemical sensitivity, so my products need to be fragrance free or my skin burns my skin and eyes. So far so good with this cream! I have very dry skin, and feel that this is doing better than the day lotion I was making due with."
"I never write reviews, but this product was so great that I will. I have oil and dry skin with some acne. I have just started to use this product every night and I wake up with ZERO acne & my skin looks awesome. I plan to buy this forever, its amazing!"
I just finished off my first jar of this and I'm definitely coming back for another. I have extremely dry skin and I'm always searching for something that can keep my skin moisturized and ice finally found it! I'm truly impressed by this night cream. I wasn't expecting to be blown away when I bought this but I am. My skin hasn't felt dry at all while using this cream and it makes my makeup looks so much better too. No more dry flaky skin. Love this! It doesn't make my skin feel oily either.
This night cream is seriously the best. I have really oily skin and it doesn't leave me shiny or oily at all. My skin is so much smoother and I've been using it for a month. My skin feels like silk even in the morning when I wash my face again. Definitely worth the buy
"I've been looking for a new drugstore moisturizer for a while. I came across this one and was drawn to it, especially because of the high quality ingredients and lack of parabens and carcinogens that I recognized... Anyway, the moisturizer is high quality. It absorbs quickly, and it didn't break me out. My dry acne prone skin will be sticking with this for a while."
"I had really high hopes for this. I ran out of my Nutrogena moisturized & decided to try this one. Huge mistake. It has a nice consistency, & feels nice when applying it. Not even 5 minutes later, my face was covered in grease. I had to wash my face TWICE to get it all off! Super disappointed. (I have normal to dry skin for reference.)"
"I bought this product about 4 weeks ago and absolutely love it. If you suffer from having a dry face, this product is perfect for you. I put it on after I clean my face, with e.l.f.'s face wash, before I go to bed and when I wake up, my face feels amazingly smooth. This is especially perfect for winter!"
I will say that this product does a god job moisturizing and the moisture lasts until the morning. Also a little goes a very very long way so this will last me forever. HOWEVER it doesn't do anything else that it claims to and I know it's a cheap product but I wish I had saved my money for something different. I also have combo skin and I feel this is a little too oily for me.
"This is one of my favorite purchases from elf. It feels so refreshing once you put it on, and it smells amazing. My face is sensitive and can get very oily and I was worried that this would just make my problem worse. But it doesn't! I don't think it makes my skin oily at all and it doesn't cause me to break out."
"Not a bad moisturizer, but for a night cream, I was expecting it to be a bit more hydrating. It actually looks/feels matte on the skin after I apply it. Which isn't a bad thing, so I may try to use this during the day instead. Don't feel that it does an extremely well job at anything, but will continue to use and see if long-term results occur. It smells like plastic/paint to me, not something I enjoy putting on my face."
I've been using this for a month and has made a big difference in my dry winter skin.
I am trying to use a different type of cream and I live this one ....
My first time trying it. Loving it it! Leave your skin feeling soft!
Smooth and silky. Moisturizes all night long. My skin feels hydrated!
It is great I love it so much it has helped my face
My face is sooo soft after using this product. I love thos product so far.
I didn't like the feel of the cream. It was to running almost like water not thick enough. And it took a while to blend in.
This product is not all that. This is the best product compared to the rest in e.l.f.'s skin care line. It doesn't smell good at all and slighty feels greasy. Will not be buying again
tried it on a whim and its a staple in my everyday routine. i use it before bed every night and it makes my skin feel so nice and hydrated. i have sensitive skin and yet it works flawlessly
I haven't been using it very long since it was sent to me as a free gift from E.L.F since my order was almost four weeks late. I couldn't believe how amazing it worked and it didn't bother my skin!
I have been using this cream for a little over a week and my skin has been looking noticeably healthier and smoother. I highly recommend this product.
"This is a great moisturizer but honestly, I don't notice any 'glow' in the mornings. It is on the greasy/oily side but it doesn't make my skin that way and it doesn't clog my pores so it doesn't bother me."
"My skin is very oily and prone to break out, but this is the best moisturizer I've used that kept my skin from getting oily while giving my proper hydration. (I also use it during the day :) Great product."
"I use this light night cream after my cleanser, & my skin is very appreciative! It is dry here in Colorado, & I find this cream is just what my skin needs --- plus, it is cruelty-free & smells wonderful!"
I got this couple of weeks ago and I'm LOVING it! My face feels moisturized when I wake up. I would definitely but this again once its completely used.
"I have been using this for a few weeks, and I am pleased with it. I use it every night after I wash my face and it feels very hydrating and lifting. I also think it helps my acne a bit also. There is a good amount in the jar, and you don't need much. The only problem is that it's in a jar. I wish it would have been in a pump, eliminating germs that might get in. Overall, good value. If you're thinking about it, give it a try."
"I have extremely dry skin, I have only been using this product for a week now. It has performed as well as some night creams that are twice as expensive. I will buy this again. It is really hydrating and I do not have to apply it more than once a night. It is a really GREAT Night Cream!!"
"I have searched and used several night creams. Most on the market are overpriced moisturizers without the touted sodium hyaluronate and citric acid ingredients. Don't waste your money on creams without these key ingredients. This one smells fantastic, moisturizes with shea butter, is very reasonably priced, and actually is an anti-aging product."
"I love this product. I've had it for a couple of months now and I've learned that using just a little bit does so much. I'm very dry in my T-zone, and after using this for a couple of nights I've noticed that I'm not dry and flaky in those areas anymore. The product itself is great for sensitive skin and smells amazing! I highly recommend it for anyone with dry skin or someone who's trying to maintain a smooth complexion."
I GOT THIS PRODUCT AS A FREEBIE JUST FOR SPENDING $25 BUCKS ON A DIFFERENT WEBSITE AND LET ME TELL YOU I LOVE IT . THIS IS GREAT AS A MOISTURIZER TOO OBSORBES WELL ONTO SKIN. GIVES ME THAT GLOW IM LOOKING FOR IN THE MORNING BEFORE PUTTING ON MAKE UP. I PURCHSED 2 FROM WALMART.COM AND WILL BE ORDERING MORE AS WE SPEAK.
"I accidentally came across this product in the store and the price was lower, and it didn't seem scented. So glad I purchased it--seems to be fragrance free (which I am very allergic to) but has a thick, rich texture which I like for a night cream. So glad to have a fragrance free option in this price range, and attractive packaging!"
I am so pleased with this nourishing night cream that I had to do a review. I have acne prone & combination skin so it's a toss up between controlling oil and being overly dry. I've been washing my face at night and applying a thin layer of this cream to my face before bed and I'm no longer having big dry patches of skin near my nose or forehead. I have expensive creams at home too and this one out preforms all of them. Love this!
"I had received this for free from elf , so it sucks to have to give this such a low rating BUT it was just SOOO greasy and would not settle into my skin , I'm not 100% sure if this is the cause but after using it I also broke out on my face :( ... I'm looking forward to trying new moisturizers from elf though"
I really love how soft my skin feels after apply the moisturizer. I am usually a gel moisturizer girl rather than cream cause my skin is extremely oily. However I have been using this for the winter and my dry skin loves it. The bad side is the smell oh boy does it smell bad. Mine smelt almost old or moldy. That is why I only gave it 3 stars To tell the truth i putt a small dab of scented lotion under my nose so I don't have to smell it. Please change that smell YUCK!
"I got this about a month ago I love how it feels and the moisture it brings to my skin, almost too much moisture. After using it a few nights in a row I find my skin is still slippery during the day. So obviously it moisturizes well. If you wants constant moisture this is for you."
"My skin is dry all year round and the first time I used this face cream, I noticed an almost immediate difference in my skin. It is not at all greasy and it surprisingly isn't thick which I love about it. It makes my skin feel smooth like it never has before and my acne problem has even gotten better because it isn't a heavy cream. I very highly recommend this face cream and will continue to this face product."
"I had used the same moisturizer for years but noticed several months ago that it just asn't keeping up with my aging skin. I have tried several different brands since then but not until I started using ELF Nourising Night Cream did I finally find ""the one"". My skin looks and feels amazing!"
I saw this in the store and was instantly drawn to the packaging. I absolutely love this product. It feels almost like a gel rather than a cream and it is so refreshing ! There is no strong scent to it either which I love. Makes my skin feel amazingly smoothe and mositurized in the morning. I could use this during the day as well because it is not overly greasy on my dry skin.
"I am very pleased with this product. I bought it approximately 4 weeks back and use it every evening and in the mornings before applying my makeup. When I started using this product I had several dry spots on my face and after 2 applications they were cleared up. This is definitely a great moisturizer and hydrator for the skin, my face is as smooth as baby skin. I use less than a dime size amount for my entire face. I highly recommend this product, it is low in cost and highly effective."
"I use a moisturizer every night, and always a cheapy store brand version. This night cream does just what it should - moisturize. It's a big container for a small price, love the packaging, and it does its job. Haven't noticed anything too fancy yet, like less crows feet, more radiance, etc. But happy with it."
this product will always be a repurchase for me! i found my face needed a but more hydration so I decided to try this. when i woke up my face was noticably more soft and it felt a lot healthier. i put coconut oil in my eye brows every night wich is good to my brows but its caused a bit of acne at the arch so I decided to put this product in instead. it almost fully cleared up the acne over night and my brows felt wonderful!
I've been using this for about a month and I'm glad I gave it a try! I have had trouble finding cream that didn't cause a bad reaction to my sensitive skin (mostly itchy red bloches) but that actually worked. Most other creams either did nothing and left my skin dry or over did it and caused more breakouts. This is just the right amount of everything for me! It is light weight and great on my sensitive skin!
I have only tried this a few times but I can already tell it works great! A little amount goes pretty far and it just feels nice on the skin. It is lightweight but left my skin looking fresh and it felt soft to the touch! I will continue to use and repurchase this!
"I was very skeptical of trying this product at first thinking it is just like any other similar procusts out there that don't really do anything...well, I'm glad I gave it a try! It's been only a few days, but I LOVE the way my face feels!!!!! In the morning my skin is so soft and smooth. My face gets dried in the fall/winter, but NO MORE!"
Love this. Have very sensitive skin- anything irritates my skin as far as cream goes. This whole skincare line is like a gift from the heavens at a price that can't be beat. as long as elf makes these products i will buy them. moisturizes so nicely without feeling heavy- but you feel like you have cream on in a good way-
"I was just looking for a simple nighttime moisturizer, and this is perfect. It is non-greasy, which is fantastic for my oily skin. It's lightweight, and the glow it provides is subtle but effective. I use it every night and on no-makeup days. It's perfect!"
"Non greasy, all natural that feels light but is a nourishing moisturizer. No sulfates or PABA. The price is right too."
"Elf sent this to me as a gift and it has changed my life! I love this stuff! When I put this stuff on I wake up with baby soft skin, it's fantastic!"
"Out of everything I buy at ELF this is my favorite. Leaves my skin glowing, I've even used it with my day cream."
I've been using it since it first came out and I love it. I have very sensitive skin and it is non-irritating and very soothing
This night cream feels great on my face. I have sensitive skin and haven't had any problems. I even use it in the morning if my skin feels extra dry!
"Ive been using this product for about a Month now and I Love it. I wouldn't use this during the day because it can make you a little greasy, but for night time and here in Texas it is wonderful. and you can not beat the PRICE!"
This night cream is amazingly smooth and rich. It's ideal for skins that need some TLC. I noticed a difference right from the very night I used it. My skin is radiant in the mornings. No more tight skin!
"Lightweight, non-greasy - love it! I have used heavy night creams with minimal results - this product is lightweight and effective at keeping my skin feeling soft and supple."
"Been using this every night and it's really made a difference. I like to apply it thick that way I can still feel it on my face in the morning, and it helps my makeup to glide on smoothly and look good."
I purchased this during the pre-sale launch. I used it a week and was very disappointed. My sensitive skin wasn't irritated but my skin felt tight and dry still in the morning. It was much more lightweight than any other night cream I have tried.
"I put a little on my face before bed. Did my normal makeup routine, primer, foundation, powder and after a few hours my face was extremely oily. I've never seen so much oil on my face. I couldn't do anything about it because I did not have powder with me."
"If you don't have dry skin, then this cream may be great for you. For me, not so much. It goes on well and my skin feels soft at first. But the feeling is fleeting and even as my foundation goes on, I know the moisture is disappearing. It's not long before my face looks as dry as it feels. Too bad, I had high hopes for this moisturizer."
Lightweight but nourishing. My skin looked bright and plump in the morning.
"Saw no change or improvements in my skin. Still dry in morning, even after, using my regular moisturizer."
Love how this goes on and the stay power. I gave it 4 Stars because I wish it was in a pump instead of a jar
I bought this and I love it! A little goes a long way and as soon as I put it on I feel so rejuvenated
Elf sent me a sample. I have very sensitive skin but gave it a shot. Love this stuff. Ordered a second jar before I run out!
This cream smells and feels amazing! It feels like coconut or cucumber water but creamy with nutrients. It's not greasy and is very gentle.
"I'm not usually someone who moisturizer's my face, this stuff is so nice to my skin and makes my skin so smooth it's a need to use it every night"
I was looking for a night cream and bought this recently. At first it seemed too oily but is working well now.
I have been using this product for over a month now. This product did not do anything at all. Waste of money.
not greasy and making my skin feel really plump. will definitely buy again to keep in my regime. so so happy
"Honestly, my skin has never felt as amazing as it does when I use this! I use it morning and night, just bought the serum and eye cream!"
I needed a good night cream. I think I found it. This cream makes my face softer and it isn't sticky!
Bought this a couple of months ago and love the way my skin feels and looks. It is light and none greasy.
"Loving the way this cream makes my skin look and feel! I have bought plenty of outrageously expensive creams and this is just as good, if not better."
This is extremely moisturizing. It doesn't smell super great but that doesn't really matter. I use this every night and I always wake up with really soft skin.
"This night cream feels nice, but it smells awful. Tossing it!"
"I bought this yesterday, tried it last night, woke up to not mega dry skin. This stuff is great!"
that cream make me feel like my skin is so healthy and moisturized
"Non oily, light formula, 3 days of use and my skin look better, smooth. Hydrate but no blemish"
Beautiful product. Hydrate skin very well. Not greasy.
I love this cream so hydrating but not greasy at all !
"Hydrates me well, and that's all it needs to do. It's smells kinds plastic-y."
I bought this 2 weeks ago and this night cream works amazing!!!!
I have been using this for about 2 weeks and I love it ! Makes my skin feel great in the morning !
This product works and its good but the only downside is it smells really unpleasant.
this night cream has a strange fragrance. Really didn't care for it. Disappointed.
