This right here is definitely the G.O.A.T When it comes to daily under makeup moisturizer !!!! Not only is it easy to travel with because of this extraordinary packaging but the formula is unbelievably moisturizing without leaving a greasy finish on your face . It works extremely well with most primers. You can also use it at night.
I bought this in 10/7 so it's almost 4 months since I have it. I'm placing an order for a new one as the one I currently having is almost finished. It last so long and you don't need a lot. I have combination skin however when I wash my face it gets extremely dry to the point where it will flake. This moisturizer fixes my dry issues and doesn't make me look like a grease ball when my face starts producing oil. I 100% recommend
"I bought this moisturiser about 2 months ago and have used it every nice since. I love it! I do have dry skin and 2 dry patches in particular on my cheeks that I was struggling to get rid of. I noticed a difference straight the way and within a week the patches were gone! The scent is ok and it's not a heavy or greasy product. I'm quite picky on moisturisers and hand creams as I dont like ""sticky"" feeling so this product ticks all the boxes for me."
I just purchased this and it's Good. I used this alonf with my Elf primer and my elf makeup mist and set and it makes my makeup look flawless. I used this alone alone. Now 4 combo/oily skin girls like myself Do NOT use it alone because it made my skin feel rough. BUT its good to use under your makeup along with a primer.
"This is a good moisturizer with a clean scent and doesn't end up oily or greasy on my skin. I only had it a week though and I noticed I was having trouble getting the product to pump out. So, I took the cap off and found the problem. The straw is only about an inch long. Really e.l.f.?"
"I received my order and wanted to try out this moisturizer. I pushed the pump and only a little came out. I tried several times and still nothing. I then opened the top and discovered that the tube that carries the lotion to the pump had disconnected. I can still use it but I'd rather not without the pump. Also, I'm not enjoying the smell. I bought the complete skin care line and none of the products has a pleasant odor."
"Bought this 2 month ago, because others were saying it was great for sensitive skin. Mine is very sensitive and reacts with redness and dry patches to elf moisturizer. I'm disappointet and will never buy this again. Also it smells kind of heavy parfumed for all natural skin care."
I used this for the first time last night on my face and neck and woke up with a bleached shirt! Luckily I used more on my neck than my face but If it is bleaching clothing I can only imagine what it is doing to my skin.
this just doesn't work it makes my fave look heavy and it opens my pores for long periods of time.
"I bought this 1 month ago because it seemed cheap and the reviews were good but a week after using I started breaking out, I tried ignoring it but now my whole face is fulled of acne... disappointing (I never break out only when using this product)"
"Wanting to get into a skin care routine, I bought this hoping that my dry, oily, sensitive skin would be able to take it. The result? My face is less oily, not dry anymore, and has no averse effects (reddening, breakout, itching) when I use it! I know it says to use it daily, but I only really need to use it once a week. I just wish it came in a big bottle so I could use it on my whole body!"
"I have been using this moisturizer for 2 months now and I love it! It feels very light, not greasy or oily at all! I have an oily t-zone, but this moisturizer does not cause me to break out. I think the scent is light and refreshing. I highly recommend this moisturizer!"
"I have combination skin, so i can get really dry yet oily on my t zone. This moisturizer is not too lightweight that it won't do anything but it's also lightweight enough that i don't feel i have something heavy on my skin. Sometimes I'll do 3 pumps to do sort of a moisturizing mask and just let my skin absorb it al. After almost 3 months using it i know it's my new go to"
Ps. The scent is also why i love it. You don't feel you're putting perfume on your face!
"I broke out horribly and eventually my face dried cause of the acne cleanser , I needed a moisturizer that wouldn't cause me to break out and would soothe my dried irritated face , and believe me I had already tried expensive products that messed up my face, I decided to try ELF hydrating moisturizer and OH MY GOSH , my face felt so good and smooth my dry face went away . I love how my face looks after I use this moisturizer. Thanks ELF for saving my face please don't ever discontinue this product."
This is my go to moisterizer. It hasnt let me down. It goes on great and long lasting. Little goes a long way and it keeps my dry skin at bay. Was worried it wouldnt be good since its cheap but it works wonderfully.
My skin broke out tremendously from this moisturizer it's tge only thing I changed in my routine. After all the great things I heard they must be false also not huge on products made in China so definitely returning this for a refund and not recommending this brand to anyone .
"I bought this towards the end of 2018 in efforts to take better care of my combination skin. So glad I bought this product. Relieves my dry patches of skin, feels great to apply. Sometimes I have to put on a second layer after awhile if its really dry, but this product feels fantastic on my skin. Has done great things to appearance that people are beginning to recognize. Also kinda gives a nice glow after a few weeks of use."
Before I started using the hello hydration moisturizer that just came out I would always use this and it did wonders to my skin!! No joke I have seen a huge difference in my ski texture which I usually have dry skin and it applies on so evenly and my skin felt so hydrated the whole day.
I have been though 4 of these! this is the only moisturizer I use!
I used this product for about 3 consecutive days and all it did was dry out my face around my mouth. It was all red and irritated.
I have very sensitive skin and everything burns on my skin. This didn't and it made my skin less dry in about 3 hours after application.
I have dry sensitive skin and this is a great product to use when on a budget. Definitely recommend!
The daily hydration moisturizer is one of my favorite products with e.l.f and I've been using it for over 2 years. It goes on smoothly and keeps my face hydrated.
This lightweight moisturizer does the job and does it well! It smells great and is inexpensive. I have combination skin (normal to slightly dry and oily in my T zone.) This moisturizer gives moisture to the areas that need it without making my T zone unbearably oily. I love it. I'm almost out and will definitely repurchase.
"I don't know why this moisturizer has bad reviews about it i love it, its thick and a little goes a long way and I love it is a pump don't let those bad reviews scare you away just try it"
"I'm currently on my second tube of this moisturizer and I just recently repurchased. It keeps your skin soft and moisturized, yet it's so lightweight. I use it daily. Would highly recommend!"
Best cream for normal and dry skin. Perfect for makeup artists - pump prevents the cream from bacteria!
"I bought this because of all the hype surrounding it, hoping it was gonna be good. After a few days of using it my skin became extremely dry in some places and gave me tons of pimples."
"I'm one of the several people that had an allergic reaction to some chemical in this product. Normally, I really like elf, but this is the most horrific thing I've ever seen happen to my face. I have hives. I've never had hives before. I just hope it goes away soon."
Holy cow did my face break out with this moisturizer like not in pimples but my face was extremely irritated with the product. I was skeptical at first that it was the cream but I tried it on half my face and yes sir my face flared up. I'm extremely disappointed to say the least I've heard great reviews about this and it really is lightweight but unfortunately for me my face and the cream are not friends. Well onto the next search for a moisturizer that works AND doesn't make irritate my face.
"I wanted to switch my moisturizer because my old one wasn't cutting it for the cold weather, so I decided to try this. I've used it for 3 days now (day and night application) and I've finally decided to stop. I had completely clear skin & now I have about 11 breakouts all over my face from this product. I only used one pump and massaged it all over my face, so I don't think that anything I did was wrong, it was the product. So upsetting."
"I just bought this moisturizer 3 days ago. Some of my friends use their products, so I thought I would give it a try. I have to honestly say it's truly amazing. I have used Clinique, Estée Lauder, Ulta; I have tried all the expensive brands: anti-aging/ moisturizers and nothing even comes close to this! I'm 47 and my skin needs a good moisturizer, and I'm SO happy to say I have found it! I'm totally shocked. I'm very excited and can't wait to start using all their products. So I just had to write a review for all the women to read....."
I bought this a lil bit ago and I wasn't very excited cause I have funny oily skin. But this with the cleanser is the bomb for my face. Im sticking to E.L.F and I dont have a problem sharing this with everyone I know my daughter is even a fan... Thx elf!!!!!
The product speaks for itself. Don't be fooled by the packaging or price this moisturizer works. It does not do wonders but it gets the job done. It can hold a candle next to high caliber brands. The pump is excellent and the trick is do not completely dry your face and add the moisturizer to your face and décolletage. Absolutely this product works for me and the price Awesome. One key thing it last it holds up and l have extra dry skin.
I got this when I was visiting New York and I only got it because I needed a skin care product because I didn't bring a moisturizer. I thought that I would only use as a short term alternative before I got a skin care product that was more high-profile. But after using it for a few days I noticed how good my skin became. It's so moisturized and more amazing than I could ever imagine! I highly recommend it because it works better than some of my high end products.
"I just got this and have used it the last few days. So far, so good. I have combination skin and this doesn't feel greasy on my face. The only negative thing I have to say is that after only a few uses the pump on the bottle quit working. I have to unscrew the cap to get to the product, which is no big deal but I just thought I'd mention it."
"best moisturizer ever. lightweight, smells great, and the price is perfect!! please always have this moisturizer. this is my new best friend! I am on a budget being a college student, and e.l.f. is the best and has the best products! I will forever be a e.l.f. lover, and will always recommend e.l.f.!!!"
I bought it over a month ago because I thought its good price. First time I put it on and felt a little greasy and little sticky. I thought it was only one time. Nope still going on. This morning to my dismay to find some tiny bumps and bit redness on my cheeks. It's plugged pores. I had to dump it. I'm sorry it's not working out for me. At least I tried.
"I bought this after some serious dry spells with my face. I love how lightweight it feels on my face, but heavy enough to actually feel like I am getting moisture to my face. Im almost out of my first bottle and have a second one waiting. I would recommend to anyone with dry skin. I have super dry skin and this just worked magic for my skin. It was best paired with the hydrating serum!"
"I purchased this after falling in love with the water essence. I am very pleased that this is creamy but does not feel oily and has been keeping my skin supple and flake-free during a serious cold blast we're having right now. I don't break out and my husband saw me using it and said that ""this was the stuff that was suddenly making me so much more beautiful"" and with that comment I am never going to stop using it. Plus, it is sulfate and paraben free, which is important to me."
"I bought this moisturizer at Target to give it a try. The bottle is odd with the pump being upside down on the bottom of the bottle. If you lose the lid, you won't be able to stand it up. The lotion itself has a nice light smell but it was very thick and dried quickly before I was able to apply to the whole face. It's not bad for the price but I've used better"
"This product came in the skin care set I bought a while back when it was first released. First of all, I'm not a moisturizing type of gal. However, people (especially my mother) are always emphasizing how important it is especially as you age, so I thought I'd spoil myself. Now, everytime I see this skin care set in my room, I feel like I WANT to moisturize. This one in particular is extremely lightweight, goes on smoothly, and looks amazing under makeup. I also love the soft blue color of the packaging."
"I've been using this for about a year now and it's the best moisturizer I've ever used. I used to use a much more expensive product, but this is less expensive and performs just as good. I have oily skin and this doesn't leave an oily film on my face....it has a fresh clean scent and soaks in well. Highly recommend it."
"I have oily skin and this moisturizer is perfect for that! I apply it on my face after it has been washed and it doesn't become oily AT ALL. It has a really refreshing scent and feel to it. When you apply it a little goes a long way to! Seriously, best moisturizer I've tried in a long time for oily skin. -I have sensitive skin too and it's super gentle on the skin."
"I have never written a review for any product from anywhere before but this product gave me such a bad reaction that I had to write about it. The product itself seems okay initially. I put it on my face after my shower, before I went to bed, but when I woke up I had the worst breakout I've ever had. Normally, I only get a pimple or two here or there but I have a full breakout of acne all around my mouth and face as a result of this product. This is disgusting and i am extremely unhappy with this."
This is my favorite moisturizer. I'm on my third bottle now. I've tried other moisturizers from other brands that actually dried my skin out. This product is lightweight and provides lasting moisture. It doesn't have much of smell which is great. I also love that it's super affordable. I've tried the one with SPF as well but like this one better as an everyday moisturizer.
Sometimes I struggle with the pump if the product is getting low but that's the only downside.
"I have struggled for MANY years trying to find a moisturizer that would actually work for my skin. My skin is the definition of combination.. in the morning, my skin is flaky but by the end of the day, my face is moist with oil. BUT using this product, I have noticed an incredible difference. I wake up with even skin (only some dry patches) and by the end of the day, my face is nowhere near as oily as it had been. I have literally tried any and all brands you could think of.. I would really recommend you try this product."
"I really like this moisturizer! I have VERY dry skin and with this product I only have to use 1 pump to hydrate my entire face. It has a fresh scent, but nothing to over powering. I also have very sensitive skin and haven't noticed any break out from this product. I have been using it for about 6 weeks now."
"I have been using this product for a couple of months and it is amazing. It has a fresh clean smell. It isn't strong or irritating. The only thing is that if you have oily skin or tend to be oily in your t zone, then be careful. Use only a little, it's all you need, really. I personally don't use it in my t zone, especially around my nose. Because it does feel kinda gross in the morning. My final thoughts: this stuff works, it's amazing, definitely worth the money."
"Just got this product in today and I really like it! Not only does this moisturizer have really great ingredients, but it also feels nice on the skin. My only problem was that it was quite difficult to pump out, but other than that, it's a very nice product (especially for the price)."
"I have oily skin with dry patches around my nose and mouth, but this product really helped out with that. I use it every morning and my skin doesn't look dry anymore. I didn't like the smell at first, but it smells alright. Also, I'm acne prone and this moisturizer didn't make me break out."
"I have combination oily skin (oily at the t-zone, normal and sometimes dry at the rest). This moisturizer is so heavy that when I first put it on in the morning, I can still feel the tackiness by the end of the day. It just sits on my skin, doesn't sink or get absorbed. I also noticed some allergic reaction my face have with this product. Wish I didn't purchase it. Do not recommend."
I received an email back in Dec... to be one of the first to try this product... I just got this in and tried it.. I love the light clean smell of this.. And I love how this feels on my skin.... I'm so happy that I got this... Thank you e.l.f.!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"I got this as a set because I went to try out a cheaper moisturizer and the reviews seems okay, but I broke over immediately over night. I wanted to make sure it was the moisturizer so I've tried it several nights. It gave me tiny pimples and dried out my skin even more the next morning."
I have been using this moisturizer from elf for months - I love it! The second I put it on my skin feels so soft and silky. Lately I have introduced the hydrating serum also - so I use the serum first and then apply the daily hydration moisturizer. My skin has never felt better. My only complaint is the pump which sometimes needs adjusting because it stops working - not a major issue but it seems to happen a lot.
"I have been using this moisturizer for almost 2 months. I apply it once daily. This moisturizer has a light, pleasant scent. My skin looks healthier and feels softer and smoother. The Daily Face Cleanser is the perfect combination"
with this moisturizer.
I got this about 2 months ago with the winter months in mind. I have excema and I have tried a lot of lotions and creams. This was something that was a hail marry for me. I put it on and my skin we instantly soothed and it feels so plump. I don't usually put it on before makeup but rather after I take it off to give my skin that extra love it needs. The scent is a little much but it does fade over time
"I think the moisturizer works well. However, the pump on the bottle does not work very well. No matter what angle I hold the bottle, nothing comes out. I've only used it a few times so the bottle is still quite full. I end up having to take the cap off and just squeeze some out onto my hand. The actual product is good though. It has a nice, light, fresh scent."
I like the lightness of this moisturizer. Seems to keep face hydrated.
"Love the product, keeps my face hydrated all day!!!"
This does exactly what it says it is going to do.
I bought it in store the first time I got the product. The product makes my skin look refreshed and not like I'm half asleep.
I bought this so my face wouldn't be dried out after washing it and it has helped my skin so much. It's not to oily it makes my face feel great after using it
Lightweight moisturizer that leeps skin hydrated all day long. I like that the tube has a pump.
"I really tried to make it work. I know I'm in the minority here. No matter what, my face would start to have a stinging feeling. I also got redness. My acne prone and sensitive skin just didn't react well with this unfortunately."
I think the changed the formula? Just restocked today and when I put it on my face it felt different. Saw that now one of the main ingredients is a silicone - dimithicone. Really sad because that ingredient makes a lot of people break out.
I love this moisturizer! I have dry skin and need a daily lotion and this is perfect. It has a really nice clean scent and just makes my skin feel so hydrated! It's a great product for the price and I've recommended it to everyone. Love it!
I've never had sensitive skin but this product irritates my skin so much! My neck and face was super red and itchy. I love elfs products though and I'm willing to give elf skin care another try
"This is spa quality skin care! It makes my skin soft, clears up acne, and softens while hydrating. I notice a huge difference in my skin when I stopped using it. I haven't found anything like it."
Thank you ELF!
I have very dry skin and this works great. It's not too heavy so it's good under makeup. The scent is also really light and pleasant. My only complaint is that the packaging can get dirty easy but that's not a big deal.
"I have oily skin, so I wanted to try the version without spf. I do find that this moisturizer leaves my skin feeling soft with no stickiness or oiliness. My only issue with this product is the scent. It isn't a bad scent, but it is very strong."
"I bought this in need of a new moisturizer, a couple days after using it my skin had become extremely dry in certain areas and irritated. I have dry sensitive skin for anyone with the same skin type just be careful"
I like the product but it does not have a long plastic tube inside to get the products out. I take the cap off to use the product. I just tried it and nothing comes out when I used the pump!
"I typically love ELF products, but not this one!! It was very sticky and had a horrible, rancid smell. I used it 4 times just to be sure I wasn't judging it too critically, and nope....still sticky AND stinky!! I returned it for a refund."
I have extremely dry skin and after trying never-ending costly face creams I tried elf's and it's a winner!! My skin looks younger and the fine lines I had and hated around my eyes and the dreaded 11s are gone for good.
"Looking for hydration? LOOK NO FURTHER. This moisturizer has got you covered. This is creamy, smooth and makes me feel fresh and clean. Thank you e.l.f. for this product!"
This stuff is amazing. I gives your skin glow. I mix it with my foundation for that satin finish. And it lasts all day without feeling too oily or heavy. ITS PERFECT!
I got this moisturizer last summer and started using it instead of my shisido daily lotion. I like the light scent and the hydrating effect of it. It is not greecy and leaves the skin hydrated for a long time. I highly recommend it.
"This stuff works great, lightweight and smells good. This is my second tube and I use it everyday. I have problem skin and this doesn't cause breakouts or texture. Will repurchase again."
i've been using this product for about a month and really like it. works great on my combo-oily skin!! Does need a longer tube inside the bottle for the product to come out of.
"I have very dry, mature skin. This product has given my skin a youthful glow. My wrinkles continue to be minimized the longer I use the product.. I am pleased and would recommend this product to anyone."
I am absolutely in love with this product! It has taken me years to find a moisturizer that doesn't break me out and leave me feeling like a total grease face. I cannot recommend this enough and I will be repurchasing this over and over again.
This works super good on my skin. I have a combination of skin so some will leave my cheeks super dry to the point my skin starts to peel off or my forehead would look super oily but that doesn't happened with this one
"I've been using this faithfully and I really like it. It is lightweight, not greasy and absorbs well. I took off one star because the pump head has never worked. I'm sure there is a little tube floating around inside the container that would make it work again, but I can't fish around & make a mess to fix it. For the price, this is terrific. I love ELF and most of their products & this one is a keeper."
"I bought this moisturizer about a month ago, and it has kept my face dewy fresh all day long without wearing makeup. I have oily skin and I experience many breakouts all the time due to stress and my diet. However, ever since I started using this moisturizer, my skin has less breakouts! I love it, and wouldn't trade it for any other moisturizer. Thank you e.l.f."
This is a very good moisturizer. The only negative is the cap doesn't work great so I just take it off and squeeze a bit of product out. I add either coconut oil or almond oil to this product and it works for me. I do use this morning and evening. You don't need a lot of product so this will last quite a while.
"Bought this because I heard great things about it. I have oily combo skin, but lately I've been having very dry/combo skin due to my Tazorac cream I use for my acne. After 2 days of using this I noticed it start to break me out EVERYWHERE. I had pimples all over my cheeks, chin, forehead. Horrible. Guess it's too harsh for my sensitive skin. If you have skin like me, don't purchase this."
"I love this mositurizer. As someone with combination skin I find it almost impossible to find a mositerizer that doesn't a. leave my skin dry/peeling or b. cause my t-zone to break out This gives me the amount of moisture I need, no more no less. Only negative is the pump doesn't seem to work consistently. Have to work quite hard to get any product out and I'm not looking forward to when there is a lot let in the container."
"Swayed by the good reviews, I purchased it. I tested on my hand first and the scent hit me. It smells like lemon Pledge. On my face, it was even worse as it was right under my nose. It also feels like someone wiped something slimy on my face. I couldn't get it off my face fast enough. Sigh. Another product in the trash can."
"Please bring back the SPF version! The tinted moisturizer isn't quite creamy enough to wear alone over most primers, and I don't like diluting it with a non-SPF moisturizer. I also loved the SPF version because it didn't have zinc (no white cast!) and it didn't pill like many moisturizers with silicone."
"I bought this when I made my change to cruelty free cosmetics and skin care. It works very well, my skin feels nourished and moisturized. It is a great product for the price. I have had no adverse effects to it and I have been using it for a little over a month now."
"I bought the daily moisturizer a couple of weeks ago. I have very oily skin and was afraid that this product like so many others would make it more oily but it didn't! Since I started a new routine my face broke out for about the first week or 2 (I also changed my face wash and night routine), but after that my skin looks healthy and refreshed now!"
"I bought a few days ago and my skin is so soft. I recently turned 13 and I dedided to start looking for skin care products. I choose to start with e.l.f partly because it is cheap, and partly because I know the products really well. I am very exceited to keep using product."
"I have normal skin, very rarely dry, but I know it's still important to mosturize. I use this product very sparingly after I shower and it always leaves my face VERY oily, and I usually use a makeup wipe to remove the excess oil. If you have very dry skin, you would love this. Other than that, find another product."
"This product would be great for the springtime and summertime. The consistency is not extremely creamy, which would not then clog pores. I use it every single day. It leaves my skin a bit glowy and more healthy looking. It's not that oily, and works well with combination skin. I am absolutely in love. But do be careful not to apply too much for it can be greasy and make you look extremely dewey."
"It was not the worst moisturizer in the world, but it definitely wasn't a good fit for me. I found it was extremely heavy, and gave my face a very greasy look and feel. I actually did use it for a while out of necessity, but my feelings towards it never improved. It's possible that someone with dry skin and no acne could find some benefit from this moisturizer, but I can't say for sure. On the other hand if you have combo, oily or acne prone I suggest you try another product."
"I have oily skin, but to keep moisture in my skin, I use this, it does leave me a tiny bit greasy, but then it sinks in and the feeling is gone! This is the best! I use it every morning and night after washing my face. I have not had a single breakout with this product. Only problem I have with this is the pump, but its a quick fix for me."
"I've used this for a while now, and I can't complain! It's not too heavy, but still keeps my skin hydrated. It works well under makeup and hasn't irritated my skin at all. Eventually the product ""runs out"", but I've found that if you twist off the pump, there is still a lot of moisturizer left to be used- more bang for your buck!"
"I've had sensitive skin for decades (yes, I'm old!) and have found very few things that don't make my face dry, tight and like I've been sunburned. It absorbs well, but not so much that you can't tell you've used it. A little goes a long way, so if you use too much, it might feel greasy though I've not had that experience. Another fantastic cruelty-free product from e.l.f.!!"
"I have used countless types of moisturizers and this is by far the best I have ever used. I have an oily T-zone and using this along with the other skincare products, my face doesn't feel greasy at all. It also leaves my skin feeling super soft. And what I love about using it is that a little goes a long way, making the product last me a long time."
"I bought this for everyday use, and I enjoy it. For the price, it works really well and doesn't leave my skin too oily. A little goes a long way, I don't know if I would buy this product again, but I will definitely be using for a long time until my tube is gone. Like most e.l.f. products, it's the best bang for your buck!"
"I absolutely love this product, but the pump broke on mine after 2 days, and then the same thing happened to my friend's (whom I recommended this to) after about a week. Super bummed at the poor quality of the pump, but love what's inside! I'm marking difficult to use because of the pump breaking."
I bought this a few weeks back. I intended to use it for daytime but it doesn't have SPF so I use it at night over my serum. I love it. It smells great and makes my skin feel soft and moisturized. This is great and so inexpensive! I will continue to use.
"This product makes your face so soft especially after just having exfoliated your face. I really like the product however, the pump has ceased to work after only 2 days. I noticed the pump's ""straw"" is only about 1/2"" long....so there is no ""straw"" that goes all the way to the bottom so not sure how the pump can work when it isn't able to ""touch"" the cream. So now I have to pour it into my hand instead of pumping it. Bummer."
I really like this product but the bottle type it comes in is not the best. Its sometime tough to get out of the bottle. I'd much rather juts have it be a squeeze bottle than have the pump as well. The lotion is great but I fond the bottle difficult.
"I used this twice, and enjoyed it, however it then stopped working all together. Nothing comes out, the pump is completely useless. Not happy. Could've been a good product, but I will not repurchase (because I now have no idea how it is long term, pointless)."
I bought this and have been using it for a few weeks now. I use it every morning when I get out of the shower and it's been a GREAT daily product. It's so hydrating and leaves such a softening finish. It works well under makaeup and it's not irritating. I have acne and it's not hurt one bit!=)
"I am VERY fair skinned and nearly every moisturizer either breaks me out or causes irritation. Not this one. It's been so soothing and my skin looks great since I started using it. I have very dry skin, I haven't had flakiness in nearly 2 weeks. I am also a HUGE fan of cruelty free products."
"I really like this day moisturizer. I have combo/oily skin that is sensitive and prone to break outs. THIS DOES NOT BREAK ME OUT! That's crucial to me because too many moisturizers I've tried break me out, more have than have not. This lasts well on my skin but at the same time soaks in and doesn't leave me oily. by the end of the day my skin doesn't feel dry our oily at all, it's a happy medium! I really love this and will definitely reuse / repurchase in the future."
"This was way too heavy for A day cream. It might work as a night cream, but it felt like I was wearing a mask. I finally had to wash my face because I couldn't go the rest of the day with it on my face. And I can't imagine putting makeup on top of it. Also, I think my bottle was defective...at least I hope so. There was no tube in the bottle that should have connected to the pump. So, the pump was useless."
"The moisturizer is wonderful. Feels good on my skin, easy to apply, keeps my face moisturized all day. However, I'm no so pleased with the container. The pump is a great idea, but mine works well only some days. Other days I have to fight to get it out. If this can be fixed, I'll use this moisturizer forever."
was so disappointed in this... had a really bad breakout and rash from it
Elf used to make this moisturizer with spf. But not anymore. Bring it back elf. SPF protection is a must
Not a huge fan of the smell or feel of this product. Very disappointed it broke me out.
I bought this a month ago and OMG my face is glowing...
I've bought this moisturizer about three times already and it's definitely one of my favorites!
"I read some pretty bad reviews about this product, but it is so hydrating and soothing. It's great for dry skin."
I also bought the Hydrating Serum that is REALLY oily (greasy) and this product is similar. My face looks like I'm sweating!
I love this moisturizer! The smell is very pleasent and it's so silky. It doesn't leave your skin oily or “wet”. It's very light weight too.
The first day after using the moisturizer my skin got oily and I started to break out. I had high expectations for this product but I didn't happen.
I absolutely love this facial cream. I have oily skin and it works wonders. Keeps my skin moisturized and feeling less oily all day.
I have been using this product for a couple of weeks now and absolutely love it. I have EXTREMELY dry skin and this has worked wonders for me!!!!
I really didn't care for this product. I didn't end up using it and since I didn't like the texture or scent or how it felt on my skin.
"I bought this last week and it's caused my face to erupt in a horrible rash. I do not have sensitive skin, and have never had a problem with any ELF product or moisturizer of any other brand, but I will not buy this again. I want my my money back!"
If you HATE scented products then this is not for you! I am always trying new moisturizers and was excited for this one. Then I smelled it. My sensitive skin was not a fan of it either. Ended up giving it away because I was scared of breaking out.
"I've been using this for about 3 months and I love this product! The lotion is not oily in the least. My only minor issue is that it slightly smells like silicone. Other then that, I will buy it again."
Who decided it was a good idea to hold the tube upside down to dispense the moisturizer? That's not a natural position ... nor does the pump even work. The only way I can get moisturizer out of the tube is to remove the lid and squeeze.
"I have dry skin, and I rather like this mousturizer but I've noticed I get tiny bumps on my face and I think it's the jojoba. In order to not waste my money I use it everynow and then, and applied VERY thinly over my entire face"
"I am currently on my third bottle of moisturizer and still love it. Not oily on my oily skin, cleans smell and creamy feel. But can you please fix the pump! It's a wonderful product once you can get to it!"
"This was too thick and broke me out. I prefer a lightweight moisturizer that sinks into the skin quickly. This was not doing that, so it made my skin feel greasy and gross. I also realized that this was making my skin break out really bad."
"I just bought this today. I usually just put hand lotion on my face when its dry but, decided to pamper myself. This stuff is amazing. Great price and my face feels so soft and not at all oily or dry. Thanks for making such awesome product."
"I bought this at christmas time and am just now getting low. It lasts a long time since you don't need much. It's great for my dry and sensitive skin, and doesn't clog my pores. It works great before my elf primer too :)."
"irritated my skin and made me break out a lot, it also left my face rlly red after using it. It doesn't fully moisturize my face and I would have to keep putting more and more on then it'll turn out very oily."
I started using elf make up products and I was excited to see they offer face lotion. I have really dry skin and I'm always trying new products that never work. This is my second time buying this product and for the price it works great for me.
"Before purchasing I tried just about everything for my dry skin, and this did the trick! It's not to thin or thick in consistency. It gives my face the right amount of moisture."
A little goes a long way and with a pump and a half applied under my make-up i find that even the most drying foundations don't cake throughout the day!
Have been using this for the last couple of months and I absolutely love this moisturizer. It's light weight but non greasy and super absorbant. I wanna invest in the whole line now.
This product is non greasy and hydrates so well. Easily worth the money. My skin is combination so I am always concerned putting something all over my face and repeated use. I also have very sensitive skin. This is perfect.
Very light lotion that absorbs quickly. Pleasant scent that goes away. Leaves my oily skin feeling more moisturized than I like- I will use this in winter when my skin is drier.
"I bought this product a month ago, I have to say I use it almost everyday. I only have to apply it once a day and my skin looks so nice for the rest of the day. Plus is smells nice."
"I got this moisturizer a couple weeks ago, and used it every day ever since. It's a good moisturizer, leaves the skin hydrated and soft. The price is also very nice, so give it a try."
"This hydrating lotion has such a smooth and light feeling! It feels great on and has an amazing fragrance! I have paid way more for lotions that have a watered down fell to them, but this lotion is very smooth and creamy! I will be buying more!!"
This would probably be just right for someone with very dry skin. I have a few dry areas like around my nose. This left my skin feeling greasy. Just too much for my skin.
"Love it! Soft skin, no redness or irritation. Do wish it had SPF in it (we all know we need it EVERY day. Bad container design- won't pump and can't see how much is in it"
"this is your average lightweight face lotion,nothing too special. ill be very clear, all it did for me was give my face moisture. it didn't add any glowing effect or make my skin look refreshed or anything, it simply moisturized. i have oily skin and i found this lotion to be a bit oily/greasy so it made my face very shiny. i recommend for normal to dry skinned people"
"Almost every night I use a drying acne cream for my acne which leaves my skin super dry, irritated and sensitive. I was skeptical of using this product because I wasn't sure it would suit my skin well. But if you have sensitive skin that gets really dry and irritated, I really suggest you use this product. Other lotions for me just make my skin burn after I rub it in. When I rub in this product, my face never has a burning sensation and is never red. I love it!"
"I have been told I need to use a moisturizer for a while now, but have never found one that I feel comfortable using everyday because I have mild acne. However, this one is so lightweight and effective that I use it every morning! I would recommend this to anyone!"
"I got this for Christmas and I have used it almost everyday. Normally twice a day, once when I wake up before applying makeup and once after removing makeup. My skin has never been soon soft and smooth!!!!!! Love the pump on it and packaging looks great as well. Definitely going to buy this again and hopefully it never goes away!!!!"
I love this product! I have been using this for a month already and I have no complaints what so ever. My skin is super sensitive I tend to break out very easily and get super dry especially here in Texas. This Elf hydrating moisturizer is very nice and never breaks me out.
I am absolutely falling in love with all the elf skincare line. This moisture is amazing. Doesn't make my face feel greasy or dried out. My skin is soft and moisturized. I love that there isn't any of the harsh chemicals in elf products. It is so difficult to find good products with out all the added bad stuff. This is amazing and affordable.
"There are a few things I do not like about this product. First of all, it has a strong scent that doesn't seem to go away no matter how long it has been on my face. I prefer skincare without fragrance. Secondly, the consistency of this cream is very sticky and doesn't feel moisturizing at all. It makes my face look extremely oil, so I only apply it at night before bed. Moreover, it makes my skin itchy every time I apply it, but the good thing is it would gradually fade away. Eventhough I like many elf products, but this one is a no for me."
"I bought this product awhile ago. I was searching for a good moisturizer because I have very dry skin and I have bad acne. For starters, I hate the way it smells and I don't like the way it comes out of the bottle (sounds like a small thing, but for some reason it got on my nerves). I used it everyday and I really couldn't tell a difference. Its not a terrible product, it just isnt the best."
"I just received it a few days ago, and I've been using twice a day. Due to all of my acne, my face gets SUPER dry and this was the solution! It is very lightweight, has a clean scent, and absorbs into the skin really well! A little goes a long way with this moisturizer! I only need 2 small pumps to cover my entire face and neck, which means this will last me a while! Highly recommended!"
"I bought this a while back and still have been using the same bottle daily. The pump is super nice, and I usually use 1-2 pumps (depending on how dry my face feels) and that covers my face and neck fully. I never makes my face greasy later on, always glides on nice and light, not too perfumey, and hydrates my skin pretty well"
"I purchased this moisturizer around Christmas. I wasn't sure how this was going to work on my sensitive skin. I have always purchased expensive brand moisturizers. I had a dry patch under my chin for months and it would not go away. After applying this moisturizer for the first week, I noticed the skin under my chin really became softer. The dry patch is completely gone, I will definitely try other products from the line."
I have used this for the past couple of months now and it works great! I have very oily skin especially around my nose and it doesn't really do anything to help but then again it doesn't claim to so its fine. Even though I do like this moisturizer it is a little to heavy for me in the mornings under makeup. I'd definetly consider it to be a medium or high for moisturization which is more suiting for dry skin.
"I bought this for a night cream, and my fiance has really dry skin too, so he started using it. It is the best moisturizer I have ever used, its light weight, no strong or overwhelming smell, there is no greasy feel to it and my skin instantly feels smooth and refreashed. The only complaint I would have is I wish there was a much bigger bottle, so we could use it as body lotion as well!!"
The product feels thick once applied to the face and has an odd odor. If you can look past those two flaws and have the time to let your skin absorb the moisturizer - it's ok. I have very dry skin and it has helped overall. My driest spots (nose and chin) are still problem areas.
"My skin breaks out with practically any moisturizer I choose (very naturally oily skin), and so this product was a god send. It doesn't feel slimey at all, and is easily absorbed into the skin. Also has a barely-there pleasant smell. This is seriously the best skin product I've ever used."
"Bought this about a month ago and I can honestly say that this is the worst and greasiest moisturizer I've ever used. It made my skin feel greasy and sticky and it made me break out in tiny pimples all over my chin and forehead area. The only reason I gave this two stars is because the smell was great, everything else about this product was bad..I have pretty dry skin and this made me feel extremely greasy.."
I've been using this for two weeks and notice that my skin feels rejuvenated. However in the past couple days I noticed the pump stopped working so I have to open the cap to use it. All in all its a great facial hydrator. I have combination skin and it doesn't feel oily or greasy in the areas where have oily skin. I also recommend using the hydrating primer after too.
I brought this moisturizer a month ago and I use it everyday. When I apply it on my face by itself it has a tingling burning sensation. I really did not want to throw it away so I mixed it with my other mosisturizer i use which is Golds Bond eczema relief due to my really dry skin. It seems to work for me the best when I mix it vs applying it by itself. Overall if you have a skin issue like eczema or something in that category I would not recommend it. If you have normal skin then it should work.
"I have difficulty finding products for my skin because I have oily and sensitive skin with severely dry patches throughout my face. I love the moisturizer I am currently using but it's a bit pricy. So I was so excited to try this new moisturizer. I like the packaging, and it smells nice and fresh. Unfortunately my skin didn't react well with it. My face was a bit red and really itchy throughout the day. I don't use it on my face anymore but it does make a great hand lotion."
"Most of the year, I have pretty fair combination skin and can get away with a water based moisturizer but come winter my skin is dry as the sahara. This one is GREAT for me but I can see if your skin is more oily this not being the best bet for you. The smell is mild to nonexistent and this seems to easily blend into my skin. Would recommend this!"
"I got this in a recent sale and I've been using it for over a week. I also bought the serum and cleanser. This just feels like there's a film left on my face. I've tried to use less, thinking that I may have applied too much but it didn't help. I do love the smell but I gave this to my teenaged daughter. Maybe someone with drier skin may enjoy this more (?). As for me, I'm slightly oily/combo and it was just too much. I won't say heavy really but it didn't feel as though my skin fully absorbed the product"
"Perfect for my dry skin! My skin was flaking off and it was extremely dry so I had to go out and buy moisturizer and elf has been one of my favorite brands for quite some time so when I saw that they had moisturizer, I was extremely excited! It's also much cheaper than many other moisturizers that I've seen. This was perfect, very hydrating. My skin looks fantastic and it's not oily!"
"I have used this product with the night cream & cleanser for several weeks, now, & very much like them all! Really love the gentle, botanical fragrance & the moisturized, but not greasy, feel of my skin after putting it on. Am just very grateful for wonderful cruelty-free products!"
"I got this a week ago, and I've been searching for a daily moisturizer that was easy on the wallet, and this is it! the smell is off putting to me, however others do like it. It's like a strange sunscreen almost. All together it is a great product especially for the price!"
"Love the actual product but the pump did not work. Constructive criticism: please test all pumps before sending them out to your consumers. If they do not work, fix the issue. I see a lot of consumers are having this same problem with this particular item, HOWEVER, the actual moisturizer works great!"
I love this so much it doesn't make me breakout and it keeps my face nice and soft. The pump worked fine you just have to hold it with the pump facing down. I know some reviews said the pump didn't work but I think it's habit to hold a pump upright by I found that you have to hold this one facing down.
"Purchased this having a low-expectation because of the cheap price, but it works awesome! It really does moisturize the skin and it's so easy to spread around and in seconds your skin feels much smoother and hydrated. It does, in my opinion, even restore/repair the skin a bit, too. Maybe the only disadvantage of it is the amount--you have to be conservative with how much you squeeze out because it does have fairly limited amount, but you don't need much anyway.. Do rub it in, though. P.S: I have dry/oily skin."
"I really like this day moisturizer. Its light, but hydrating. Not greasy. Nice base for my makeup. My only issue is the bottle design. The pump is too short so I have to unscrew and squeeze the product out after the third use, and the solid color of the tube doesn't allow you to see how much product is left. So I fear I won't realize I need to reorder until its already all gone."
"I brought this and wasn't expeting much but I was plesantly surprised. I have oily skin and it was perfect for me, it wasn't greasy or heavy either. To make things even better. The ingredients are perfect for my skin too.....Well worth the try, the smell is off putting but it no way effects the use of the product and you cant smell it once its on."
"This is a moisturizer. It moisturizes. It's not going to replace all of those expensive potions and lotions. What it will do is keep your skin hydrated and soft. It saved my skin at the tail end of winter, and it's lightweight enough for those with sensitive skin to use daily without irritation. I've found it to be a great alternative to heavy night creams that often cause unwanted breakouts. If you're looking for a good, basic, no-frills moisturizer, this is definitely worth it!"
"Great product, works well and is easy to use, it leaves my skin feeling soft"
Best moisturizer ever! Work perfect on hyper sensitive skin!
Has a clean scent and feels a bit tacky on the skin but it leaves your face feeling refreshed.
"I really like it, it does have a scent but it reminds of like sunblock kind of. But all in all really great product 10/10 would recommend"
My skin is acne prone and oily and I felt like this made me even greasier. Smells good but not good for my skin type.
"Really liked this product moisturizing wise, but something in here made my face itchy and red so i had to stop using after 3 uses :/"
I've been happy with this purchase.. I use it in the am before I apply my make up nice soft smell. I will buy again
I got this a month ago and it has became my favorite moisturizer. I have really dry skin in the winter and this has helped so much.
I have severe dry skin and this face lotion is lightweight yet powerful! Great smell and feels amazing!
Bought this at Target. So light yet it makes my normal to oily t-zone skin feel soft & smooth. Great value!!
I ran out of my usual moisturizer and decided to try this because it's a lot cheaper than my usual one. I love it!
"Works great, only complaint I have is that it takes a while to dry and set into the skin. But once it does, it's fantastic!"
"I bought this because I needed a new moisturizer, normally I use the Clean & Clear Dual Action Moisturizer, but this just broke me out and caused my skin to feel like an oily mess."
"I use it under my primer and foundation. It is a bit greasy, especially if you have oily or combination skin, and a little goes a LONG way. But, overall it's a pretty good product."
"I like this lotion, smells good and moisturizes my skin without being greezy."
"however, the bottle itself IS HORRIBLE. it's so HARD to squeeze cream out of it."
"but looks fancy, sure."
I was hopeful when I bought this. It's thick which is fine but my skin didn't want to absorb it. It stayed sticky and on top of my skin. I didn't like the smell either which makes any product hard to put on your face.
I've been using this for years before i go to bed at night and i always wake up with very hydrated skin! i love this and will continue to buy it! It also doesn't irritate my sensitive skin.
"I've used this for years and it has never broken me out. I have acne prone skin and it's difficult to find such a light, nourishing, fast absorbing moisturizer unless you spend a lot of money. I love this stuff!"
"I'm almost out of mine and its worked really great. The only thing is throughout the day i get oily, not sure if thats because of this or something else."
"This product is so wonderful. I use it after I shower and before I apply makeup. I have combo skin, and it works even in places where I'm more oily. This is very lightweight and leaves your skin feeling dewy at first, then very soft and hydrated."
I tried this on a whim when I just needed a moisturizer and didn't want to spend much! Little did I know that it would be my favorite! I've tried so many and this is by far my favorite!!
"I bought this not expecting much but i loved the smell and the consistency, i like that it is in a tube and not a jar, i thing it works fine for my normal / combination skin."
I got this lotion to try in comparison to some more expensive lotions. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it works. I have combination skin and this does not leave my face feeling oily or greasy at all.
I bought this a few weeks back as I could not find a moisturizer that worked for my skin. No matter what I put on a few hours later my face would be dry. This lasts all day with no smell or oil feeling. I love it so much.
"The product itself is great. The moisturizer is smooth, and smells good, but it never came through the pump, and so I have to unscrew the whole top to get the product out every time."
I just bought this today and I fell in LOVE with the pump. I just feel like its so much more sanitary than sticking my fingers into a container and getting the product out
I bought this moisturizer last month and can't stop raving about it to everyone. It's hydrating without being greasy. Doesn't have an overbearing scent. And doesn't make my sensitive skin break out.
"This last long and doesnt leave a greay look on my face. I will admit I mix it with my Nothing but Grapefruit cream, but thats only because I have severe dark spots that I'm trying to fade."
I bought this a month ago and it's good for normal skin. The consistency of the product is great but I have oily skin and don't work very good for my skin type.
I recently purchased my second tube of this. I love how lightweight it is on my skin.I feel this can be used for any skin type. Its also worth the price because a little goes a long way. I use this everyday and will continue to repurchase!
Got this couple of weeks ago and I'm in love with it! It is so light and it removed some dry patches I had on my face. I would definitely buy more when its completely used.
"Feels very good on the skin, light and not greasy. It does have a slight scent but I like it so that doesn't bother me. If you're looking for a basic no frills moisturizer, this is the one for you!"
I really like this moisturizer. It's lightweight and doesn't feel greasy on my skin. It goes on well and absorbs quietly. I do feel a little tightness on my face after the moisturizer is dry and set in. The smell is not strong either.
"I have dry/sensitive skin and this moisturizer is wonderful on my skin. Will repurchase. It's so hydrating, no allergies or breakouts. Thank you ELF!!"
This moisturizer is so lightweight yet so hydrating. It has a beautiful clean/fresh fragrance. The bottle makes it so easy to dispense and apply the perfect amount. I have very sensitive combination skin (mostly oily) but this works so great for me. I will definitely repurchase!
"I bought this about a week ago, and I couldn't be happier! I have a skin condition called ichthynosis vulgaris that makes my skin very dry and flaky (feel free to Google it). I have used everything from baby lotion to lotions prescribed by doctor's, and nothing helped. This product has made my skin look amazing, and it doesn't feel greasy either. I will be buying this product loyally from now on."
I bought this product a few weeks ago because I had never tired e.l.f. skincare products and was looking for a new moisturizer. I have fairly sensitive skin and I think the fragrance that this moisturizer has irritated it. It made my skin bumpy and dry and gave me a red rash on my neck. I switched moisturizer's yesterday and the rash immediately went away.
"This is a good reliable moisturizer. I have sensitive skin and it is a struggle finding products that don't make everything dry, itchy, or burn. As long as I wait a few minutes between washing my face and moisturizing, this product causes no irritation whatsoever and works very well. It is of course, a great value."
I purchased this to replace the Aveeno Positively Radiant® Daily Moisturizer With Sunscreen I previously used. I have dry skin and this was smooth during application but did not nourish my skin like it needs. It wasn't lasting for me and the scent was light but I didn't care for it. I gave this to my mom.
"I bought this a few days ago because I was in desperate need of a moisturizer for my dry skin. I use it after washing my face and it works wonders! It doesn't give me a greasy feel or look - it actually feels wonderful on my skin (very lightweight) and absorbs very nicely. Leaves my dry skin soft, smooth, and hydrated!"
"I recently bought this and I really like it. It does feel pretty hydrating and nourishes my skin really good. I love the packaging too, this is a really good moisturizer for the price! Glad I bought this. :) It also leaves my skin feeling nice and soft."
It smells nice and its a nice texture. It tends to leave my face oily a little especially the T zone as the day goes on even when I have it on for a few minutes I can feel the oil. The tube is hard to use. I thought the pump goes to the bottom. It doesnt only about 1/4 of the way. Doesnt always pump out.
Recently just started using this moisturizer and I love it. I never really used a moisturizer before because I have oily skin. This product doesn't add to the natural oilyness. I use it along with the serum. I also really love the scent! It's clean and refreshing.
"I got this to try it since I'm tired of spending money on expensive moisturizers. This is perfect! I have dry skin and you definitely could tell when I woke up but now my skin if smooth and soft. I use it right before bed, after showers, and before applying my makeup. It's so light and now my face feels moisturize for the whole day!"
"I have combo, sensitive skin & this product is perfect for me! I really love how easily this product spreads. There is a fragrance but it's very light. I can honestly say that this product feels very refreshing and I did not have any problems with grease or irritation. I did have a problem with the lid but I got it to work again. Overall, the quality & quantity is so amazing for the price!"
"I've been using this for months, best moisturizer for my skin. I have very dry skin and my nose is super dry. I put this on at night and in the morning before I do my makeup and it works great! Gets rid of the dry skin and smooths your face. It smells good too and it's great for the price."
"This moisturizer is so gentle and feels like a treat for the skin. It is the perfect moisturizer to wear under makeup, especially within 15 mins of applying, because it is a bit tacky until completely dry. It isn't greasy and it doesn't clog the pores. Great product!"
"This is a great moisturizer! You really don't need to use more than a pea sized amount, it goes a long way. I use it at night after using the Daily Cleanser and it makes my face feel so hydrated and refreshed. I don't use it in the morning, because I am prone to break outs and since I am using a primer which provides moisture, I don't want the extra product on my skin."
This entire skin care line is absolutely amazing! For YEARS I've looked for a product to properly hydrate my skin but it seems like none of the products I purchased would penetrate deep enough into my skin. Then I found this!!!! My skin has transformed in a matter of days. I suffer from severely dehydrated skin but my skin now looks so supple and youthful! I swear I'm forever greatful for this skincare line!!!!
I bought this not that long ago and I use it every day. A few uses after I bought it the pump stopped pumping. I love the product so much that I just screw the lid off and get it out of the tube that way. It leaves my skin feeling so refreshed and hydrated. In my opinion it does exactly what it claims. Just wish the package had held up longer.
"Amazingly soft moisturizer on my super dry patches, doesn't make my normal/oily spots break out. Smells lovely! I've been on the search for awhile. Been using expensive moisturizers, creams, masks to try and keep my dry patches under my eyes/cheeks soft. THIS IS THE ONE FOR ME!"
"I've started using this every morning for a few weeks now and I love it. It keeps my skin hydrated all day (I have dry, sensitive skin.) I also love that it comes in a pump dispenser, eliminating contaminants that would come with a jar. It's worth a try!"
"This moisturizer works well, its nothing special, but I don't expect moisturizer to ever be special. The problem with this product is the pumping feature. After about the first 5 uses, it sometimes takes me minutes to position the bottle just right in order to get just one pump out. Seems that this has been a problem for other users since it came out, and it seems like this would be an easy fix. Until its fixed though, the frustration is not worth it."
"I've used expensive brands. This is better. Combination dry/oily, African-American, acne-prone skin and this doesn't clog or irritate it. A little goes a long way. Doesn't feel heavy or greasy. You have to make sure your face is truly clean in order for it to go on smoothly, like with any moisturizer. I bought it a moth ago and still have a lot left! I use it daily my skin stays soft and smooth all day. Everyone's skin is different and the negative comments may turn you away, but at least give this a try! I'm sure glad I did!"
"Bought awhile back and have given it quite a few chances, but I hate the residue it leaves behind. However, it didn't break me out or anything and I have sensitive skin. Glad elf is coming out with skincare and more products, but wish they would keep prices at a minimum. My other moisturizers at this price are much better."
"My face was extremely dry so I decided to try this product and it is perfect! I use it every morning and it immediately hydrates my face and makes my skin so much softer. It isn't oily at all and it never makes my face breakout. It lasts the entire day, too. I definitely recommend this product."
"Love this product! As far as quality and effectiveness, it's hands down the best moisturizer I've ever used. However, the way it is packaged doesn't make too much sense. It's a squeeze tube, but with a pump. This makes it difficult to get the product out of the container, as well as makes your storage options limited."
This is definitely a 5 star product and I love everything about it BUT I've been out of it for over a month and it hasn't been in stock!!! I'm going to have to go back to my old moisturizer because that is readily available to me. I'm tired of constantly checking to find out that it still isn't in stock.
"This is a great lightweight moisturizer! I use it in the morning and the night cream at night. This is wonderful at keeping my face feeling good all day. It sinks into the skin well. The only thing I don't like is the smell, it sort of smells like medicine."
I bought this a week ago and it has already blown any other moisturizer I've ever tried out of the water not greasy doesn't make me break out helps my skin stay nice a moisturized all day it's amazing the pump can sometimes be hard to use just make sure you have it upside down and your fine:)
"The only reason I gave this product a 4 instead of a 5, is because the pump broke the 2nd day of use. I figured just a fluke, and it sure hasn't stopped me from using it day and night. love the product, helps keep my skin smooth and soft and moisturized ."
"The product itself is really great. I have really dry sensitive skin and it does the job without being greasy or anything. I use the entire skincare line every day and my skin looks and feels awesome. The only problem is that after about a week or so, the pump stopped working all together and there's still a lot of product left in the bottle. The bottle needs to be redesigned or something."
"Bought several of the new skin care products and started using them right away. This moisturizer is beyond anything I have ever used. Ever. It has no scent, it's not sticky or oily, and it leaves your skin feeling smooth and soft. I use it every morning about an hour or more before I get ready to apply any makeup."
"I bought this product around two weeks ago and I have noticed a significant change in my skin. I suffer from hormonal acne and I have super sensitive skin; this moisturizer really helped! Its not oily or sticky. I use this at night and it really helped my skin a great deal. However, the packaging is not so great. The pump is not very long, and I have to wrestle with the product every time I want to use it."
I bought this when it was up for pre-orders and I have been living it ever since. I use it twice a day after I cleanse my face in the morning and after I take off my makeup at night. It leaves such a nice glow on the skin without making my face oily or greasy.
I bought the moisturizer 4 days ago and my face broke out! No happy
I use it for 3 mount ago and a love it
It is Good for me and you
This is such a good product. It works and smells amazing
"Been using this product about 3 months ,its an wonderful facial cleanser!"
I have oily skin and it works great to keep me in balance
"My skin usually feels dry and right after washing it, but after a pump of this moisturizer my skin feels perfect and moisturized"
I love this product. I use it every day and my skin always feels so soft and hydrated.
Definitely recommend!
I love this product! It leaves my skin looking glowy and healthy! Really moisturizes and replenishes skin!
Been using for about two months and It hydrates really well and not sticky. A little goes a long way
"It feels nice on sjin, doesn't leave a sticky or greasy/oily feel. I put it on after I wash my face before putting on primer."
"As a person who suffers from very dry skin, this was amazing for my skin. It's very hydration and would recommend it for anyone with dry skin."
I've used this cream several times for my face. I love it. I love how it feels smooth and not greasy. It goes on smoothly.
At first I thought that it was going to be really greasy but after i put it on and it set it felt really creamy and my face was radiant!
I literally bought this 3 days ago and it is the best moisturizer I've bought! Saw improvement in my skin already!
"I just wish there was SPF in it and it would be perfect. ELF, are you working on a moisturizer with SPF?"
"Fantastic under makeup. Not oily, absorbs quickly... make up glides right over it. Skin is hydrated but not greasy ! LOVE IT !"
I have very sensitive skin and this moisturizer was one of few that didn't break me up. But I just find that after using 4 this new one feels different .The next day I have a pimple and I hate elf.
"I bought this product specifically because I have sensitive skin. I had a terrible allergic reaction to this moisturizer after one use. Sensitive skin people, stick to what you know!"
I LOVE this product so much. I apply my acne wash with the Duo Cleansing Brush while I shower and then apply this moisturizer after my shower. And my skin feels absolutely flawless compared to my skin after using my acne wash alone.
"It really did exfoliate my face but unfortunately, it made me break out. I have moderately oily skin. I wish they had more diversity when it came to their skin care products. I hope they make a new one soon."
I only use the face cleanser at night but I use this in the morning and at night every day and it's a great moisturizer. I'm still a bigger fan of gel creams but this is still really soft and moisturizing
"I wasn't too sure of the moisturizer at first, but after my skin adjusted, it is amazing. Just the right consistency. I use this after my toner and Vitamin C Shield. My skin just drinks it up!"
Great for spring/summer because I don't need to much lotion and it isn't heavy. Wasn't great for me in winter I am very dry. Going to the SPF 15 next.
I purchased this just to give it a try. I am glad I did. It's helped my extreme combo skin. This sinks into the skin quickly so you are able to apply your make up with no wait time. It performs like a high end product that ive used in the past.
"I started using this about 2 years ago and, since then, I only ever breakout when I'm stressed or switch moisturizers. However, if you use too much, in my experience, it can make the face oily."
I bought this moisturizer a few weeks ago along with the cleanser and so far I love it.After I wash my face with the cleanser I apply the moisturizer on my face.It leaves my skin very fresh and moisturized.I would totally recommend this product!!
I am loving this moisturiser. So gentle on my sensitive skin. Have used it under my make up every morning and its making my make up apply alot easier. Only downside is that the pump tubing had come off in the bottle
I really wanted to love this. I have combination skin that's not sensitive at all. This stung my face and it made me break out...my face felt horribly oily. I really dislike the strong scent. This is my least favorite elf product I've tried.
"This moisturizer is great. Light, not greasy. The only problem I have with it is the tube. It falls over in my cabinet every time I open the door. It is not stable. Please change this!"
This is by far my most favorite moisturizer. You can feel your face hydrated immediately after application. Goes on smooth and no oily finish. I really love it.
"I use this moisturizer after washing my face, and it actually really is great. It completely brightens my face and softens it. The directions only say to use two small pumps, but I use like four at a maximum, and that seems to work for me."
"New favorite. . It does just that-moisturize! Now that my skin if moisturized, i am significantly less oily. Definitely repurchasing. The scent doesnt bother me and i dont even notice its there."
"Love the serum and this lotion. I cant use it before i put my make up on, makes my face greasy. but i use them after i wash my face at night and love it. Wake up in the morning with very soft skin!"
"I bought this about a month ago and I love it. So light, yet very nourishing and I noticed a difference in the texture of my skin almost right away. Definitely a must have!"
"This moisturizer isn't the lightest I've ever used for my oily skin but for the price and ingredients it's my go to now. Does not clog poors or cause excess oil. The fragrance, like the cleanser, smells like generic dish soap to me..."
Dont use moisturizers usually but knew I needed to get something for my combination skin with days that I need some hydration and love using this product.
I get very dry skin in the winter time and when I saw elf was coming out with a hydrating skin care line I was SUPER excited and its been everything I wanted it to be!
"Love this product. It is a little difficult to get out, I feel I have to pump for ever before anything comes out. However the moisturizer is light and doesn't feel thick on your face."
"Goes on smooth and clean, minimal scent. I've definitely paid way more for less in the past: amount and quality. A tiny bit greasy, but seems to dry not so bad."
I really like this product. I've been using it every morning for a week and it really does stay with my skin all day. I had some issues with the pump after a couple of uses but it seems to have worked itself out now.
I bought this about 2 weeks ago and used it every day. It was everything I was wanting in a hydrating cream. After 1 1//2 weeks the pump stopped working and now am very disappointed in the product. Probably would not purchase it again only due to the pump.
"I have combination skin, I started to use this and it didn't do anything. It didn't hydrate my face and after layering it on, it feels good on the skin but whenever you apply foundation, you will see cracks in your skin. it also broke me out like crazy, I love the scent but this product for horrible for me. I threw it out immediately. DO NOT GET IT!"
"I have extremely sensitive dry/combo skin. I was excited to try this. Unfortunately after 2 days use me skin is cracking and getting a lot of rough spots, as well as my skin feels raw. I had to stop using it immediately. My skin still feels like it burning. The scent is very strong too."
It just didn't work for me. I wish it had though.
"Product overall design and container is good! E.L,F is doing a fantastic job when it comes to this! The Moisturizer is far to fragrant for me, I prefer my moisturizers to be more less on the fragrant side because I don't need my face to smell good, i need it to feel and look good! I didn't use the product long enough to give a fair judgment. All i can say is the smell is to strong!"
This does moisturize my face well but it gets way too oily under my BB cream. Even without anything over it it makes my face way too oily and I am naturally not that oily in comparison to others with oily skin. The price is good for the amount of product you get and if it really works for you
"I received this last month and been using for about 3 weeks. It's the best moisturizer I have ever used. It goes on smooth, not heavy and hydrates those areas where I need it. Make up goes on better. I use all e.l.f cosmetics and this product. I'd love it they had the cleanser and Scrub."
The fragrance is overwhelming and also this product leaves a gummy feel on my face.
Broke my face out! Just not for me! Something in it
Its working wonders on my dry flaky eczema. I really recommend this!
Love all Elf skin care products! The scent on this one is amazing!!!
Bought it and been using it every morning and night. I love it!!!!
"This lotion is amazing , it leaves your face very soft and hydrates it ."
Very lightweight. Love the feel.
"Love it, pretty moisturizing, a little too scented maybe"
Is a very light weight so that good and i think is for combination skin and dry skin
"I love how it don't leave my face feeling greasy, and my face doesn't feel dry either"
Smells great and is very hydrating. Not greasy at all and absorbs we'll. I love it!
"It is hydrating, but not a good daily moisturizer. The makeup doesn't evenly go on the skin and looks blotchy."
"Ive only been using this item for about two weeks and its made me break out and causes dry patches, does not moisturize my already dry skin."
I love this moisturizer. It's not sticky and it doesn't break me out. It's also good for oily and combination skin.
I love this moisturizer. I've been using it for about a month and my skin has gotten so much softer. It's not oily or overly fragrant either.
"Itchy, blotchy skin 5 minutes after applying. Not for people with sensitive skin. Didn't feel very moisturizing either. Fragrance is unnecessary."
This product smells amazing!! It goes on smooth.Makes your skin feel amazing in seconds!! Can be used daily.
"I didn't want to spend a lot of money on some moisturizer so, I bought this instead. I have dry skin and it really works"
"I have horrible eczema and I've only ever been able to use aveeno, but this stuff is my now go too. I feel so hydrated afterward!"
This moisturizer is not sticky or greasy! It's very hydrating and I think this is one of my best purchases from elf cosmetics!
I rarely leave reviews but this is an outstanding moisturizer. perfect balance of moisture and primer.
"I bough this for a daily moisturizer... its good. Not expensive. Will not make miracles on your skin, but it will keep it moist"
I bought this moisturizer about a month ago and just started using it. I like the way it goes on my face and is a great product for the money.
"I absolutely love this face cream, this makes my face feel fresh and its get for everyday use. I am just in love with this product best so far."
Very good product. Met my expectations. Easy to apply & last all day. Makes my skin very smooth and easier to apply my makeup.
I just bought this item about two weeks ago and it is fantastic. Does not make you skin oily. It is the perfect moisturizer!
"I needed a new moisturizer so I decided to try this. I put it on and it felt like it was moisturizing but it turned my skin red and itchy! I stopped using it, maybe it was just my skin but it burned!"
"I really like the product, I.e., the moisturizer, but the pump does not work well or consistently. Would prefer a different package. I do not like the pump."
I bow it a month a go i havent get any brake outs and it moisturize the skin like and for that price it works better than a pricie one I try clinic got brokeuout and estill lauder blash the same ..so I'm keeping this one elf
Amazed at the performance of this product. Very hydrating as it states.
I used this for several weeks and it made my face extremely oily
"Good product; has a light, fresh scent; light moisturizing and a little bit goes a long way"
I believe in this stuff its amazing need a moisturizer try this
Makes my skin super soft & hydrated!! Worth the price!!
"It smells great , its light weight and I use it every night."
This moisturizer is amazing for super dry skin. It smells so good too
Great product.....Easy to use. The fragrance is not strong. Can be used for a man also.
Great product for a fabulolus price. I have used high end products that did work nearly as well.
I use this product every single day! I will definitely be purchasing again!!
"Just a little amount can go on all face, but maybe too heavy for summer"
I love the subtle scent it has. Wish it had SPF though . Leaves my skin really nice
I love this moisturiser very much.Scent is sweet and texture is smooth.
Lightweight! Creamy! Great for all skin types! Very good price!
I have a very dry face especially during winter and this helps my face soo much.
I've only had this a week but it is heaven on skin.
I bought this about a week ago I love it it makes my skin soft
i LOVE this! i already need to purchase another one!
Feels very nice and lite.smell is good too. Wii buy again
"I just bought this and I kind of like it. made my skin very soft, not a strong smell to it."
Leaves skin feeling soft and NOT oily! Love that! Great bottle- pumps out easily!
Good product and great value. Good consistency and easy to use
I love it its so good n works well i also like the little pump
Goes into skin quickly. Not greasy. Problem is the pump. I have trouble getting the product out.
I love this product and this company.
"Thanks some much for caring about GF, and now testing on animals too."
Lasts a while! So lightweight but very moisturizing. I would definitely stock up on this product. The lotion bottle itself is so cute!
I have been using this for awhile and I love it. I have dry skin in the winter time and it alway makes my face feel so good.
"This feels very waxy and ""hard"" on my face and I felt no moisturizing effect on my face at all. very dissapointing. Has a weird smell too."
I received this product and it has a itching burning sensation
I've been using this for about a month. Its great for everyday use!
"First product that I don't like from elf, not hydrating at all, very dry consistency :("
