I love how this product is all natural. I am allergic to sulfate sand it took me forever to find products that didn't use them. The lotion isn't greasy and makes my skin incredibly smooth and soft.
"This is an amazing product, my daughter has had issues with her face that doctors couldn't help with medication. Using this with the Shea soap has restored her beautiful skin!"
Cream works. Feels good on skin.
Please bring back your old Problem Skin Moisturizer. It was fantastic! It has solved all my skin problems and now I can't find it anywhere. It contained Nigilla seed which is highly medicinal. Your new product (Balanceing Moisturizer) may be okay for others but not for me. I didn't even mind the smell. It was mild. I love all your products and I would pay twice a much for the old formula. Please start making it again! It is the one product that got me interested in your other products.
"I LOVED the original version of this lotion. I used it twice daily and for the first time in my life had clear skin (Im 44). It was AMAZING. Suddenly, the ingredients changed and it wasn't as good and now I can't even find this at the stores at all. What is going on? I NEED this to come back!"
"I love the old formula, however Shea Moisture has lost me on yet another product. Adding coconut oil to the blend may seem fine & dandy but this oil is known to clog pores and should not be used by those prone to breakouts. Shea Moisture, I am sorryâ€”I am breaking up with you. Please bring back the old formula."
"Please bring back the old formula, what an amazing product that was. Can't even use the new formula, you are losing so many loyal customers!"
"This used to be an AMAZING product when it was called the ""problem skin"" moisturizer. Well they rebranded it to ""balancing"" moisturizer which is great, but they needed to leave the formula alone. BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA, WE BEG OF YOU!"
"This seems to be a very diluted rough attempt to substitute the natural formula that existed before. If anyone knows of a good dupe of the previous formula before that changed it, I'd greatly appreciate it."
"This moisturizer has changed my life! Three years strong and many more too come. I have combination/ acne prone skin and this product has helped improve my skin by 100%. My face is now acne free, no redness, smooth, and has smaller pores! I highly recommend this product to everyone. Thank you shea moisture, your product really helped me <3"
"So moisturizing, it's crazy how people rate this with four stars or less! It's one of the best, it's affordable, it has quality ingredients, it works for my dry skin. It just works wonders, I'll recommend this to all my friends and family! This made my skin clear, supple and radiant.. FIVE STARS!!"
"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!! I have extremely oily skin and very acne prone, between this moisturizer and the black soap my skin stays mostly clear of acne and SO helps with the oil!!"
"This used to be my go-to moisturizer. My skin is extremely sensitive and easily breaks out. This used to be on the product to I could rely on to keep my skin clear and moisturized. Not in more. It no longe absorbs well instad it leaves a film. On top of that, the fragrance has changed. It used to have a clean fresh, not it has a sweet scent that makes me nauseated and gives me a headache. Why do companies insist on ruining good products I do not know!"
"I really, REALLY wanted to love this moisturizer. When I first used it breakouts immediately followed, and because I wanted to love it so bad I blamed it on something else. After changing everything else but the moisturizer I KNOW that it is the cause of my breakouts."
"i've struggled with really oily skin for years, and although not acne prone, it makes me uncomfortable walking around school looking like an oil slick. i saw this at walmart last night and it has already worked wonders. woke up this morning and first thing i noticed was that my face wasn't oily! usually when i wake up, my face feels like a greasy frying pan, but not today! i love it already! thank y'all so much!"
This was my go to moisturizer until recently when I noticed my face breaking out after buying a new container. I did some investigating and realized that they now use coconut oil in their moisturizer. I have oily acne prone skin and coconut oil doesn't help with that rather than make oily skin extra oily I can honestly say I was upset. I'm now using the Nubian Heritage African black soap moisturizer with NO coconut oil and my acne has cleared up.
"I buy multiple bottles of this moisturizer at a time. I have perioral dermatitis and cystic acne, and this is the only lotion (other than the shea butter line) that I can use on my overly-sensitive facial skin without causing burning. I use this when my skin breaks out a bit, and it keeps it clear, helps with the oiliness. It took a bit for me to get used to at first, because it's so thick, but now my skin has adjusted and it drinks this right in, leaving a soft, smooth texture."
This moisturizer has changed my skin! I have oily and acne prone skin and everything bothers my skin. I apply this at night after washing my face and it's AMAZING. My skin is soft and you can literally feel this product do it's job. It makes my skin look and feel great. Smells great too!
I literally keep telling everyone I know that I think this is some kind of magical potion. It has drastically changed my skin for the better. My skin is staying matte and clearing up! NOTHING else has had this effect on my skin. I am elated! My skin is softer and finally looking radiant rather than dull. When I do get hormonal breakouts they clear up so fast...like magic. Please try this whole line if you are dealing with any skin issues. Who the heck cares what it smells like...it WORKS!
I love this lotion on my oily skin. I use it as a night cream because it is pretty thick. I like that it is sticky and my only issue is that it dries fast but that's actually helping my oily control! Would have given it 5 stars but I have only used it a few weeks.
This moisturizer is the best I've ever tried and I have tried many. It lasts all day and a little goes a long way.
"This mouisturizer helps to balance out my combination skin, but requires regular use for around 3 weeks to make a noticeable difference. Once it starts working it really works!"
"This lotion has takenover any thing I have ever used I had big blotches on my face, funny how I had not seen my face This clear In a long time even my friends and sister notice the blemish //"
"I bought the box that had most of the African Black Soap products in it after coming to love the Toner. All the other products are OK, but I noticed the moisturizer would sit on my skin, leaving it super oily. If you have a skin type that doesn't absorb moisturizers well, this super thick and pasty moisturizer is not for you. It made me break out terribly with cystic acne, which I hadn't had in years prior to using this product."
This problem skin moisturizer works great and I usually love the smell (natural/earthy) but lately at every store I can only seem to purchase ones with a very off putting STRONG baby powder smell. Having to take back product after product is starting to become a great hassle. I'm in the process of looking for a replacement because the lack of quality of this product is getting ridiculous! Where is quality control?!
"I love this lotion so so so much I use it with the black soap bar, I use this facial moisturizer daily and it helps to keep my skin soft and hydrated and most importantly CLEAR!! My acne prone skin has much improved since I started using this line of products."
I've been breaking out DAILY using this product. It's terrible.
I like the fact that it clears my blemishes and soften my face.
This product broke me out and made my skin dry. DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR SENSITIVE SKIN
I enjoy the scent and love the intense moisture it provides! I've also noticed that it calms any skin irritation!
"I have had lots of trouble with acne and struggled to find a product that really helped , let alone that was natural. This product helped clear my skin and I can tell when I forget it because I will have breakouts."
"This moisturizer is wonderful, works really well on my face, the only down side is that it seems to give a bit more shine to my skin than I would like. I already have oily skin and this doesn't help take that away BUT it does work."
"This product definitely does moisturize my skin, but is way too thick and heavy to work well with my oily skin. A short time after applying this moisturizer, my skin gets really oily, even more oily then this usually is."
"THIS SHEA MOISTURE BLACK SOAP MOISTURIZER IS NOT A GOOD PRODUCT FOR OILY OR EVEN COMBINATION SKIN. I HAVE USED IT FOR 6 MONTHS AND IT IS LIKE PUTTING VASELINE ON YOUR FACE. THE MOISTURIZER SITS ON YOUR FACE, DOES NOT BLEND INTO THE SKIN AT ALL, AND YOU FACE IS VERY GREASY ALL DAY UNTIL YOU WASH IT OFF. FIND ANOTHER PRODUCT, THIS IS TERRIBLE."
I love other SheaMoisture products so I was excited to switch my moisturizer to this brand as well but unfortunately this product made me break out so bad! I had my acne pretty much under control and then I started using this product and it all came back worse than ever. I wanted to switch moisturizers because the one I was using was quite a bit more pricey than this one but it looks like I'm going to have to go back to the more expensive moisturizer.
"I have perioral dermatitis and cystic acne, this is the ONLY brand that doesn't trigger either, no parabens, lanolin, castor oil- which all cause breakouts. Even natural and organic companies still use parabens - Shea Moisture doesn't. This lotion keeps my skin clear and moisturized without drying it out. I'm obsessed. I can't live without this moisturizer"
I purchased this product at my local Walgreens on a whim when my other moisturizer I used was sold out. I am so glad I did. I have been struggling with blemished red skin on my cheeks for years and honestly after only using this for around a week and a half I have really noticed the redness going down! I will for sure be purchasing more of Shea Moisture's products
This product made my skin oil free for a hour but after it became excessively oily and caused breakouts
This moisturizer is very thick! It leaves my face very oily and greasy. It doesn't absorb well on my skin AT ALL. I have combo to oily skin btw and This product doesnt smell bad. It has a pleasant vanilla kind of smell.
"It has a light smell like vanilla to me. It's moisturizing, without feeling greasy. But, after a few days of using I noticed my face would itch. Started off mild and I thought oh product maybe working to clear skin, but around 5 day, that night after applying my skin was itching like crazy , so had to was off. I have now discontinued using it. But, it may still work for others. It's a no for me unfortunately."
"This is definitely suitable for my acne-prone skin! Keeps me from breaking out and my skin isn't oily after I use it. The only thing I dislike is how thick the lotion is, but I thin it out by damping my face before applying. The fact that it's made with natural ingredients is a huge plus!!!"
The only moisturizer that has consistently worked on my face without irritating it.
Great for combination skin. It's the only moisturizer that doesn't cause breakouts for me. I also love the smell
"I have extremely dry, sensitive facial skin and used to struggle with my nose and forehead peeling constantly. Had tried tons of other products but this is by far the best. It stops the peeling and keeps my skin feeling soft and hydrated. Thank you so much!!"
"The moisturizer hasn't done anything extraordinary for my skin. Not to mention it doesn't have an SPF, an essential ingredient in a good moisturizer. I almost want to give the product 0 stars for that. The smell isn't bad, it's a bit strong but it doesn't last long at all. My skin is a bit less oily, but again nothing extraordinary."
This has literally saved my skin. It's effective on the dry spots and doesn't make the rest of my face oily
I absolutely love it. It makes my skin very soft and leaves it moisturizer all day. Highly recommended.
Leaves my skin feeling soft without a greasy appearance. It is quick drying as well. The smell is very calming.
"Unfortunately, I seem to be allergic to this moisturizer! I'm guessing it's the willow bark, and wish that had been bolded in the ingredient list. I love the other products though! Just not this one."
I love this Moisturizer because it's all natural and leaves my skin feeling very soft !
Great for acne & blemishes I use before my make up everyday great moisturizer
Love the moisturizer. I don't peel like a snake any more.
its great. smells good. And feels awesome. I love it.
