I was surprised cause I didn't think it would help any and I was wrong I use it every night. My face looks better. I'm going to keep using.
I bought this a week ago and use it morning and night. I have drastically seen a difference in my face! I have comdonal closed acne and nothing had worked from OTC to prescription. This is the first thing to actually work!!! I use it with my other revitalift glycolic products!! I am in love and I want to say thank you for making products that actually work!!!
"I'm in love with this product! Even though I saw great reviews online when I was buying it, I didn't expect the results to be so immediate. I use it at night and my skin was amazingly smooth in the morning right after the first application! It's been really helping with the texture on my skin. I will definitely try the other products from this line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just once a day (at bedtime) because my skin is sensitive and I have to wear sunscreen (SPF45) daily, rain or shine, indoors or out. This stuff gradually evens out skin discoloration--I have a sprinkling of darkish patches of color on my cheeks and have noticed they are much less noticeable with this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the Bright Reveal line for a couple of weeks. My skin looks smoother, brighter, and has a nice glow. I'm happy!"
I love how this made my skin so soft just in one overnight use. My skin looked brighter in about 1 week. It is easy to use but I did have an issue with the pump sometimes only having one side of the moisturizer come out.
I have been an Licensed Esthetetician for 17 years and I test every thing. I gave your Bright Reveal Dual Overnight Moisturizer a try and after one night my skin is Beautiful! Nice firmness with no dryness including plumpness! My slight lines are invisible and my light sun spots faded gently. I use professional medical grade skincare and I am impressed with your product.
"I purchased this product several weeks ago and would not repurchase. Despite following directions on the package and I quote, ""Before the first application, tap the bottle on a hard surface and press the center of the pump several times"", the two sides do not come out evenly. It may be a good product but if a person can't use it per the directions, how can the results be observed."
I received this product as a sample a year ago. I fell in love with it. I never use night creams or follow a skin care regiment but this product got me hook. Leaves my skin really soft and had brightened my complexion. As well I notice my fine wrinkles are know less noticeable. I highly recommend this line of products. After my sample run out I continue purchasing and is now part of my nightly routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample a while back and loved it so I went to my local drugstore to purchase one. This is quiet pricey. However, it is worth the money. It is not too oily on my oily/combination skin. I use it every night and it does help with improving my complexions."
"I've been using this and the daytime version for about a year. Love the way my skin looks in the morning. This morning after I washed my face, I put the daytime version on to prepare for makeup. As I was putting on my blush, I realized I had forgot to put on foundation first! My skin looked so good I couldn't tell I hadn't put on any foundation. Now that's a good review!"
I have been using Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer for about 4 months. I love the serum and lotion in one package. However I am only using the lotion as the serum portion is no longer coming out of the dispenser. Do I break open the outer plastic covering to get the serum?? I love the way my 59 year old skin looks..it's soft and smooth and wrinkle free!!! Please L'Oreal fix the packaging... I would have rated this 5 stars...but I'm keeping a star because I'm only using half the product.
This moisturizer is an outstanding nighttime ritual! I love the entire product line but as an aging women I love even more that after a few short works of use I have visible results that I can see!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It does moisturize very well with a small amount of product. I have noticed line shrinkage around my eyes especially.
It really looks moisturized and softer in the morning. It locks in moisture but is not oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The texture of this lotion is light and it has maximum brightening effect. It's the strongest on the market. Thank God for L'oreal. It helps.
"Loved this Revitalift overnight moisturizer! I have used it before but when I needed to buy more, they had taken it out of WM stores (which WM does a lot with something I like)"
I only been using this overnight moisturizer for few nights and i already love it so does my skin. I wish they carry more of this in the store.
"Product Doesn't Come Out of the right (white) side despite shaking it, hitting it on hard surface, etc. Disappointing."
"I love this line, but the dual overnight moisturizer, has a horrible delivery system. This container is awful. This has been a problem last few yrs, why dont you change it ??"
I use this product under my night cream before bed and under the sunscreen during
the day. I've noticed that my skin improved in terms of reduced fine lines and it feels refreshed!
"I've used this product for several years prior to this order so it was no surprise how well it works. I just won't be without it. Leaves my skin soft and smooth, and after using it for several weeks any blemish I might have had is completely gone."
"This stuff is amazing!! I've been using for a few weeks now. My skin is smoother and more radiant!! My youthful glow is back, fine lines are smoothed out!! The dullness is gone!!"
I purchased the entire line of brightening products. I like the feel of the moisturizer. It's not to oily feeling and that's perfect for my naturally oily skin. I didn't see that much of a difference in my overall complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Bought this about a week ago and already notice a difference in my skin. It looks brighter and so smooth in the morning after using.
"I use this at night, and the next day my skin looks and feels rejuvenated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It makes the skin so sooth, bright and moisture. I add SFP day cream on top and Night cream at night for better result."
"It's good to use around neck area, it's fast absorbing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this product and within one week I was able to see a visible difference. This is now part of my daily regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use cleanser, revitalift pads and this dual overnight! Great clean and fresh feeling! I also, use other skin care and eye creams. I also, like to try new L'Oreal products to add to my skin regimen! Nightly and daily!"
I purchased this about a month ago. I was looking for an overnight moisturizer that would improve my skin. I followed the directions for use and was very disappointed that I would wake up in the morning and still feel like the product was sitting on top of my skin. It felt as though it never absorbed and was a layer that sat on top. I would have to rinse my face in the morning as to not feel like I would be sweating it off as soon as the day got warm. I am very disappointed. This has been a complete waste of money.
I did like the luminous look and it did moisturize but I didn't notice and lift or great moisture
I've been using this product for just a few days and have already seen dramatic results. My skin is soft and hydrated each morning and I think my age/sun spots are already fading. Love this product - HATE the dispenser...please fix!!
Love this product. Nice light fragrance that doesn't break me out. It's not heavy and glides on so smooth. My skin completely absorbs this. Noticed a difference after initial use. Will keep this in my daily rotation.
"I really loved the overnight feeling of the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer. I could feel the moisture softness on my face in the morning. My skin starting getting moisture, specially living in a dry hot place. I have also switched my Clinique moisturizer to The L'Oreal Paris Dual Overnight Moisturizer. Very happy with the lasting feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm 45 with combination skin of oily t-zone and dry every where else. As a mom of 5 with youngest 3 year old twins. My body and skin have gone through a lot. I always have issues with night creams being too heavy or simply not enough. This night cream worked great on my skin on my skin and the transition was smooth. I didn't break out. AAA+++ It left my skin feeling great and brighter!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use the dual overnight moisturizer every night and it has paid off! After 30 days, the bags under my eyes are pretty much gone and the fine lines and wrinkles on my forehead have definitely diminished! I still have sun/age spots that I can't seem to get rid of, but look at my results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using LOreal Bright Reveal Brightening Duel Overnight moisturizer every night before I go to bed. It has a very pleasant mild scent, not overpowering or chemically at all. I absolutely love the combo Glycolic, vitamin C and Pro-retinol provide to my skin. In the morning my skin is extremely soft, and taut. My overall tone has also balanced out. So greatful fot this line! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have oily skin so I wasn't too sure about trying this. I tried it on the weekends and I was surprised that it didn't leave my face oily. In the morning my skin felt moisturized but not oily at all. It had the right balance. Will purchase! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved the Loreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Dual Overnight Moisturizer!! It not only moisturized myface, but also replenished my usual dry skin. I loved that it was not heavily scented nor did it sting on my face. It left my face very soft and clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm head over heels for this product is light, creamy rich and yet has no sticky feel . My skin really felt pampered with this product and it worked wonders on my complexion and overall skin .For me its the best product among the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am not very consistent with using moisturizers to be honest, but I really wanted to put this product to the test. I hate the oily greasy feeling of moisturizer, especially the next morning. Most times they just seemed to make my face more oily. After only a couple night's use I could tell this was different. There was no greasy feeling the next day. I forgot to put it on one night and actually had to get up and go put it on. My skin feels amazing now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This dual moisturizer is effective at moisturizing overnight. My skin is brighter, and more evenly toned. Some of the splotches and redness I have are diminished. I also have less acne to contend with on a daily basis. I was surprised at how gentle this formula is on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer is amazing. I have sensitive skin, especially in the winter with the temp changes.. my face gets dry (cheeks, nose, chin) and oily (forehead) and I struggle with a moisturizer at night that works without making either the dryness worse or making more oily. This was PERFECT! No irritation at all and within 2 days of using it my skin was so soft and felt great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Super light weight dual evening moisturizer that left my skin feeling clean, soft and refreshed for a good nights sleep. Upon waking up, my skin was not over dry or tight. It was smooth and moisturized. There was a noticeable difference in my fine lines around my mouth after 2 weeks of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love all the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal products I received from BzzAgent. I used the Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer every night after cleansing my skin with the scrub and peel pads. I LOVE this overnight moisturizer! My skin felt wonderful and was still soft and smooth the next morning! My skin looks wonderful after using these products for 2 weeks. LOVE It!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like how this moisturizer feels on my skin. I have pretty sensitive skin and so many creams feel heavy to me. This moisturizer felt rich but not thick or greasy. I liked how it absorbed quickly and did not leave my skin feeling sticky or goopy. I felt comfortable putting it on right before bed because I didn't have to worry about it getting all over my sheets. The two-part serum was easy to mix up in my hands and never felt heavy. I'm really liking what this did for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"VERY hydrating. I used a bit more than necessary the first night. I was pleased with this moisturizer. It's a bit heavier than the day time one, but did an amazing job, even though I wasn't religious about night time moisturizing. I will definitely be using this more often, if Florida ever gets a ""winter."" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think L'oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Dual overnight moisturizer would be good for just about anyone. When I wake up my skin feels and looks so much healthier and younger looking. I can definitely see fine lines getting smaller. I use a.m. and p.m. , plan on purchasing again. It doesn't take very much so it's very much worth the price! Good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thankfully, I dont have some of the issues (wrinkles, uneven skin tone ) that this line of products addresses, but I definately feel like my face and neck area are smoother and brighter. I can totally see how this would work like a champ on the aforementioned issues. The 2 part cream is light and non greasy, and my skin felt very alive after using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer doesn't leave my skin with a greasy feeling after applying it. It goes on light and smooth and has helped reduce the fine lines around my eyes. I like that it's a dual action moisturizer and think it's helped even out my skin tone a lot! I would recommend trying all of the products and using them together to get the best results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved that the serum and moisturizer were in one product. The packaging was a definite plus. It made me feel like I was putting something expensive on my face. This may well become part of my daily routine. #Gotitfree from Bzzagent and Loreal [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Every night I would look forward to using my L'Oréal Brightening Dual Moisturizer. My skin has never felt so silky smooth! The dual dispenser looks very nice so can stay out in plain sight and the pump worked perfectly every time! It has a nice light citrus scent! I used 2-3 pumps every night and it was plenty for my face and neck. And as a bonus my hands have gotten softer too. This moisturizer is a face care essential! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really wanted to be impressed with this product. The dual pump somehow made me think it was going to be better than all my other moisturizers, but boy was I fooled. A cold cream works better than this. Yes, my skin felt somewhat smoother, but it almost left s weird film on it. I wouldn't recommend. It's just okay in my opinion.

"I hardly ever use moisturizer, just cause I forget, but with Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer I could not wait to get to my nightly ritual. The results of this product where amazing. My face and skin not only looked brighter, fresher and more toned after 30 days, but I think I look younger too. This is a product I will buy over.

I've been using L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Duel Overnight Moisturizer for almost 30 days. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth.

"I loved Revitalift Dual Moisturizer because its creamy and I saw a change in my skin in two weeks. My acne spurts disappeared and that put a happy face on this adult. I love that the product is anti-wrinkle and the pump feature gives you enough product to cover entire face and neck. This product made my face feel softer , brighter and acne free.

Just finished using this for 30 days. Loved it starting at day one! It really moisturizes after skin is prepped using peel pads. Has an orange citrus smell that I really like. Leaves a glow that is instantly noticeable. Not feeling the winter dry skin on my face that I usually do this time of year. Prefer this to my department store night time moisturizer. Will definitely continue to use this product. Skin feels refreshed. Cost is a bonus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I will definitely keep these wonderful products as part of my skincare routine!! I totally recommend these products to anyone who has trouble with an uneven tone!!

I think the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer is effective and fun to use. I have used this product nightly now for over 30 days and am happy with it. I like the way the clear and creamy products are kept separately in the bottle and then come together when you dispense the product. I only needed one small pump of moisturizer each night for my skin to feel hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was so happy to recieve the Loreal Brighting Line to try out. I had seen it advertised on television and wanted to try it so i was so happy that i quailified for this campaign. The product felt so good going on and made my skin feel like silk. I had to give it such a low rating because the line of products caused me to have an alleragic reaction.

I think L'Oréal bright reveal dual overnight moisturizer is a good product. I have used it for 3 weeks and am seeing a pretty big difference around my eyes. I recommend this to anyone with skin starting to age. The kit together is great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I apply this moisturizer after washing my face before bed. Since it's been cold the heater is drying out my skin usually. But in the morning I've awakened with my skin still soft and moisturized! I'm impressed. This is definitely going to be apart of my nightly routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used the moisturizer every night. It left my face feeling soft and smooth. It did not feel oily or heavy. I especially love the scent. It has just the right amount of scent, it is not overpowering. I little bit goes a long way. I will definitely be purchasing it in the future and recommending to friends and family. This will forever remain part of my skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer is definately a must have. I apply this every night before bed and I am definately impressed by how well it works.

I overnight moisturizer from the reveal collection was really great at first once pumped into hands it feels really stick but glides well when applying to face. After it feels still sticky it takes a few seconds for it to skin onto face after it feel soft and refresh. When I wake I can feel my face feeling soft and looking glowy. I really am happy with the results. I will continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I really like this night moisturizer. It really leaves the skin smooth and soft when you get up in the morning. I like the smell and it is just the right strength. It is really easy to apply and absorbs into the skin quickly. I did not see any anti-aging benefits but it does moisturize. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This dual chamber night cream is the BEST I have ever used, my skin feels as smooth as silk after its applied. It absorbs completely with no greasy feel. I cannot say enough good things about this product I will not be without this product it is permanently part of my skin care regiment [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am not completely in love with this moisturizer. It feels a little thin to me for an overnight moisturizer. I can't really feel it on my face within 15 minutes of putting it on. It's lightly scented though which is a plus. I don't really notice or feel much of a difference in my skin when I use it. I don't feel the price is justifiable for what you get. Its just okay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection for a couple of weeks now and I love the way it makes my skin feel and look. It is smoother than I can ever remember and my dullness is gone. This is super impressive to me in particular being as I am over 40 and the cold temps have set in where I live. I'm looking forward to continuing the system through the winter - hoping to keep my skin out of the winter doldrums. So far so good! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the L'Oreal overnight Brightning moisturizer is a keeper in my daily skincare routine. It smells so good and goes on smoothly. It only takes one pump to do your whole face and neck so it should last a while. When I wake up in the morning my skin looks so radiant and fresh. I will definitely keep this as my skincare routine.

I have been using Revitalift Bright Reveal Overnight Moisturizer for more then 30 days. A little goes a long way. At the beginning I felt it was too thick I think it was because I was not used to using moisturizer at night but after two weeks of using it I didn't even notice I had it on. After getting compliments for my husband and my kids about how clear my skin looks I think this will be my one of my favorite products to use. I would more certainly buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I currently use another nighttime moisturizer, but was up for a try. I think it was ok, I think I just prefer the one I have been using. I feel that it does have some ingredients in it that I am not as familiar with and I try to be very careful about toxics and what is absorbed in my skin. If I didn't have another product that I felt safer about the ingredients and the feel after I apply, I would be open to using this product as I think it is good.

My skin was not sticky, and I woke up the next morning to a still soft and well moistened skin. Thank you L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This overnight moisturizer is not like others I have tried. I have combination skin & most moisturizers leave my skin feeling slimy or greasy after application. This one did not do that in the least. I applied it at night after cleansing and before bed & could still feel & see the benefits the next morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I felt like this product really exceeded my expectations. It isn't a heavy product, it absorbs quickly and has a fresh smell. I used the entire line and I was so pleased in fact, that I also purchased the products for my mother. In my opinion, the price is very reasonable for what the product offers. Two enthusiastic thumbs up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Revitalift Bright Reveal Dual Overnight Moisturizer has become an essential part of my nightly skin care routine. I begin with the scrub cleanser, then the peel pads and finally the overnight moisturizer. It is so easy to apply and leaves my face looking and feeling wonderful....so soft!!!

After weeks of using L'OREAL Paris Revitalift dual overnight moisturizer I have been waking up to a more hydrated face. It's rejuvenated my face for the past 4 plus weeks I'm very pleased with this face product. It glide on smoothly and absorbs nicely in to my skin leaving it with a velvety softness. Just like the day moisturizer I appreciate this product soo much. I high recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this every night for eight weeks. I loved that I only needed a very small amount to use. This applied really smoothly absorbed fast. It doesn't has a strong scent which I like. My skin looks great after the eight weeks. My skin is smoother and brighter. I would buy this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked this product. I like how moisturizing it is and I like that it contains essential anti-aging ingredients such as glycolic acid and retinol. As mentioned in a previous review, I had to discontinue using this line of products due to overdrying of my skin. That was disappointing because I was excited to try all of these products. Otherwise, it feels great on the skin and I would be willing to try this again in the near future without other glycolic containing products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I very much enjoyed the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer. I used it each night for 30 nights. Only a small dab was necessary. I have combination skin, which goes oily in the summer and dry in the winter. I could tell my skin was changing during this period of time. I just used a little more and it was perfect. In my experience, this is a fantastic overnight moisturizer for combination skin, like mine, and for different seasons. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has a light citrus scent. It feels great going on. It's a little bit of an issue trying to make sure that the two products come out evenly. Just like with the daytime moisturizer, when using this in conjunction with the rest of the Revitalift products, it didn't provide enough moisture for me. If I were to continue using it, it would not be with the rest of the line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved this serum and moisturizer combo cause it's so convenient and takes up less space on my counter. I like that it comes out side by side so I can apply the serum first and then apply the moisturizer. They both sink in rather quickly and in the month I have been using it I have noticed a difference in my skins texture and brightness. Best part it did not break me out since my combo skin is sometimes a bit fussy with new products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a very nice dual moisturizer. I love the smell and it goes on nice and smooth. It isn't heavy at all and does a nice job of moisturizing, , although I am used to a thicker/heavier night cream, I liked this just fine. I honestly don't see much brighter skin, but it is soft and smooth and no irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Overnight cream at it's best. I have never been one to keep up with using a night cream. After looking at younger pictures I've decided it's time for it. This is a refreshing product that doest feel to heavy or caked on. I used on pump and it was plenty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My face feels so incredibly soft and much more smooth after using this for over a month. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is need of a good moisturizer that works and wants results. I feel as if my skin tone is evened out a bit more, and I was coming out of my summer time tan and this helped tremendously. I love this new L'Oreal Revitalift overnight moisturizer ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this moisturizer simply doesn't need to have glycolic acid in it. If you are using the peel pads, that should be enough. I prefer my moisturizer to soothe and lock in moisture after my actives rather than be another treatment added on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Revitalift Bright Reveal Dual Overnight Moisturizer is definitely a great product. Within my first week my skin looked softer, smoother, and younger because of the two anti-aging treatments in one.

I think that the dual overnight moisturizer was like a mini vacation of hydration for your skin to soak up during the night to feel smooth in the morning and like there has been some elasticity returned to that face and neck.

"I love, love, love this overnight moisturizer. The 2 different formulations mix easily in my hands and are very smooth wen applying. It feels light yet moisturizes very well. It does not leave any sticky or gummy residue on the skin and it did not stain my pillow. My skin felt velvety in the morning and the fine creases under my eyes and along my crows feet were less visible. I will continue to use this night time gem.

"First off, when I opened the Loreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Dual Overnight moisturizer I was surprised to see 2 test tube like bottles inside the main container. When pumped the 2 formulas dispense together (one clear and one creamy) and you mix them on your hand and apply. The smell is great and I think they do the trick for overnight moisturizing. The only downfall is that the formula is a little sticky/tacky feeling for my taste. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the overnight moisturizer. I have oily skin and sometimes moisturizer leaves me with a sticky feeling. I put this moisturizer on at night and in the morning my skin felt soft and appeared brighter. I will happily keep using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how this moisturizer just glides on my skin! It really does give you a 'glow' with it's subtle little glitter flecks that it leaves behind. It brightens my skin and preps it for applying my makeup by leaving my skin thoroughly moisturized. I just use two pumps and it's enough for my whole face and neck. I never feel dried out or oily after applying. I think this is one of my new favs! I will surely be sad when the bottle is empty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Out of all the products in the bundle, I really liked the moisturizers the best. I thought this was a cool product because of the two types of products. The gel and the lotion really helped to make my skin feel soft and supple after the cleansing gel. I will definitely keep using it and recommending that people use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that the dual overnight moisturizer was like a mini vacation of hydration for your skin to soak up during the night to feel smooth in the morning and like there has been some elasticity returned to that face and neck. It make the skin feel so good. It also helped my skin feel more uniform and even it felt like it was even a little birther all over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer , I was pleasantly surprised at how much my skin loved it. Due to my oily skin, I am usually mindful of moisturizers because they are usually too oily but not this particular one. I am excited to add this to my skincare regimen because my skin is left feeling moisturized upon waking up in the morning rather than oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think I haven't been using it long enough to experience all the benefits. It's a good moisturizer but I haven't noticed any significant difference in my complexion. Although nothing positive has changed, my complexion hasn't worsened either. With my sensitive skin, that's always a worry when trying out a new product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is one of my favorite products from the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection as well. The ingredients are separated into two tubes and only mix after being pumped out. My skin feels cool and instantly smoother after applying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I put this on before bed and wake up with such soft skin. I've definitely noticed my skin looks less dull and more vibrant. I have had several coworkers and family members comment on my complexion recently which is always a great thing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love the Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer!!!! First, I love the packaging. It's so sleek and stylish. Just a single small pump is all that is needed to cover my entire face and neck! It glides on super smooth and leaves my skin so soft and smooth.

This moisturizer really brings my skin to life. I have struggled with dry skin and blemishes my whole life. The deep moisture that my skin now has after using RevitaLift consistently is very impressive! I have had many compliments on my face and I am very impressed with the visible difference! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product. I've tried other overnight moisturizers in the past but they just made my skin feel greasy and gross. The Revitalift Bright Reveal Overnight Moisturizer goes on and absorbs quickly. Other creams are blobby and thick, but this stuff is fantastic. I wake up feeling fresh and clean, and my face is always soft! Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I do think this is very moisturizing, however it leaves my face feeling a little too sticky for my liking. A little goes a long way and I do think one bottle will last me quite a while. I will continue to use it and hope for good results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been working on my 30 day Revitalift Challenge & let me start by telling you I have very sensitive skin. The Brightening Dual overnight moisturizer is easy to use has a pleasant smell doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy & in the morning my skin is smoothe & soft. All of my friends & coworkers have noticed a difference in my skin stating its brighter & I look younger!!! This is definaltly a great product line to try I know I will continue to use this product for a long time!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really do like the daily scrub cleanser! My son does as well. He's been using it with me, and it's helped him get in the habit to wash his face. Unfortunately the night cream and or the daily moisturizer made me break out. I haven't broken out in a long time. I have continued using the pads, and I think I do notice a difference in my skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked using the L'Oreal Brightening overnight moisturizer. It made my skin feel better in the morning, it didn't look as tired as normal. The texture also improved. I'm overall very happy with the Brightening overnight moisturizer and I will definitely use it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using all of these products together for awhile, I personally don't like what they did to my facial skin. I feel like the cleanser and pads were just a bit too abrasive, and the moisturizers left my face feeling a bit too greasy. Overall, I have no plans of using this in the future. Will just stick with my usual routine products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This overnight moisturizer is one of the best I have tried. It goes on smooth and absorbs quickly. I wake up in the morning to really soft skin. It doesn't leave any residue on my pillow and has a pleasant smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is more than I expected it really keeps my face hydrated all night not only does my face feel smooth but it just looks clean. I will most definitely continue to purchase the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin gets so dry over night especially around the creases of my nose. It has been a struggle to find a moisturizer that lasts through the night but this one did and it does not make your face feel so heavy with product. I love that my skin can breathe and be moisturized at the same time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was suffering with a bit of acne. And one night after washing my face, I used the dual overnight lotion and noticed my skin started to sting. I also noticed this happened the night after I had my eyebrows waxed. So apparently, if your skin is any sensitive state, you may get a bit of a reaction. With the exception of those 2 instances, overall the product has worked great. Just wanted to Mention it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oréal's Bright Reveal Dual Overnight Moisturizer is probably my favorite product in this line of products. This is a great way to end the night! This product is used only at night after using the daily scrub cleanser and peel pads. From my personal experience the peel pads caused me to have some skin irritation and once I applied the overnight moisturizer it helped calm my skin. In the morning my skin always feels great and looks great too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am writing this review after using this overnight moisturizer for 30 days. My skin seems smoother and brighter. I like this moisturizer because it is not heavy and does not leave my skin looking greasy. It absorbs fairly quickly into my skin and has a pleasant scent. I like the entire Bright Reveal line and will continue using these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This moisturizer is my new best friend! I have been using it faithfully for two weeks now and I already notice fewer wrinkles and smoother skin. It feels light, not greasy at all. It even made the dark circles under my eyes look lighter - seriously! The red/white dual pump looks beautiful too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this line and can't say enough good things about it. The overnight moisturizer works really well and has a nice scent, too. I like the way my skin looks and feels in the morning. It seems to be working on my fine lines and wrinkles and smoothing everything out. This line has given me a glow and radiance I haven't seen in a long time. Thank you BzzAgent and L""Oreal!!

I live how L'Oréal revitalift bright reveal dual overnight cream absorbs so quickly on my skin leaving it feeling luxuriously silky smooth immediately after application. I am equally impressed with after just a few days use my skin looks and feels more radiant. Smells great too! Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is probably my favorite product of the line I feel like it just soaks in my skin and just makes it so soft. When I put it on my skin just glows. It makes me feel more confident about not wearing makeup [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It doesn't take much to cover my entire face so that's a plus. It isn't greasy which is good because my skin is oily. I haven't noticed any huge improvements in my skin and I've used it every night for weeks. It's not a bad product. It's worth a try to see if it will work for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the brighting moisturizer for the night is absolutely wonderful. Did not make skin feel heavy or overly greasy with product. My skin texture is absolutely smoother brighter and much even toned. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I found the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer to be rich and moisturizing. It was a decent overnight cream. I had issues with the cleanser and some of the other products in this line, and it caused breakouts. I am not sure if this moisturizer contributed. But, if you are looking for a decent overnight cream to help moisturize and brighten, I would give this a try to see if it works for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this overnight moisturizer. I will definitely be purchasing this product. I use it every evening by using 1 pump. It is enough to cover my entire face and neck. My skin has improved so much since trying this. Its brighter around my cheek and forehead area and it doesn't feel greasy or oily at night. Ive been using it about 3 weeks now and have had such great compliments from the girls at work. I've so excited to share my experience. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I felt the L Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer is quite a good lotion. It absorbed beautifully and I woke up after the first night looking a bit brighter with smoother skin. As I continue to use it the results appear to be even brighter skin. Another nice feature of the lotion was NO irritation to my sensitive skin. Great product, easy to use, cool concept of the two lotions in one bottle ....kind of fun! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ok... so i have oily skin and I was hesitant about using this moisturizer, but boy was I wrong about it. I absolutely love it. It had no strong odor to it and it easily absorbs into your skin. I did not experience any breakouts and my oily skin actually looked and felt better. This is a product that I will be using again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Your eyes are a dead giveaway on age. So I always look for a great product without spending a fortune. I LOVE this night cream. Nothing heavy or greasy and absorbs fast. After 2wks I have noticed a big difference around my eye area. The lines seem less define and very minimized. My complexion looks great after using the skin care program we received. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just want to say how wonderful this product is I have been using all four products since the day I receive them and I will continue to use them I love the fact that it has that wonderful Citrus smell instead of a really strong perfume smell because who like to put perfume on the face [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this product, but I gave it a 3 stars because it took too long to absorb into my skin. I usually wash my face right before I go to bed, and would normally lay right down afterward, but because it took so long to absorb, I would not be able to go right to bed. This product gave me great result, my face was flawless the next morning. Unfornately I had to discontinue the use due to pricing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I mentioned on another review about the scrub that it left my skin feeling clean but dry, but I don't mind at all when I have this moisturizer to put on afterwards. It practically glides on your skin and instantly relieves and softens your skin. My cheeks are so soft now after 2 weeks I keep asking my friends to feel i! No joke!! LOVE!

"I wish I had taken before and after photos as there is such a difference! These L'Oreal products have eliminated my under eye circles and have evened out my uneven skin tone. I've been asked by various people what I'm doing differently and which products I'm using. Most importantly, I'm being told how great my skin looks! I've already bought more of these products.

I use this product nightly face feels fresh after I use it. This is a great product my face still feels soft and fresh the next morning. I did not see any change in my wrinkles.

I have been using the entire for product line for almost 2 weeks now. I am enjoying the overnight moisturizer as well. It does not leave my skin feeling greasy and I do believe my skin looks better when I wake up in the morning. It is lightning some pigmentation spots I've had on my face and is brightening the overall appearance of my facial skin. And I have a problem sometimes with products making me break out. I have not had that with any of the Revitalift products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I found the overnight moisturizer ok - while I think it worked ok I did not like the ""film"" it left on my skin. I used only one pump to cover my whole face and some of my neck and it left me feeling like I had a sticky coating on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This unique dual overnight moisturizer is Amazing! I can't say enough good things. Right now in Tn it's warm during the day and cold at night. So I'm using air conditioner then heat.

I think each step and product is necessary for the gorgeous end Result! In fact at Thanksgiving I got compliments on my Skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really wanted to like this moisturizer. Loved the smell and luxurious feel of it. However every morning I'd wake up to a greasy face and another blemish. No difference in my skin other than more oily and significantly broken out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that this brightening dual overnight moisturizer is so awesome! It has ingredients that would be found in high end salon products like glycol and pro-retinol.

"I really liked this moisturizer because it is very light. Its more of a serum than a creamy moisturizer. I thought it was going to feel sticky on my skin, but to my surprise it absorbed very quickly. I have seen an improvement on my face. The formula does not irritate my sensitive skin at all. I really think these product work well on all types of skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I think my skin is really sensitive because when I used this moisturizer it irritated my skin and burned a little.

My skin is pretty dry and gets drier with the change in the temperature. Now that it is cold my skin especially on my face seems to not be able to stay moisturized. Putting on the dual overnight moisturizer has helped dramatically with the dryness of my skin during the say. This will definitely be a product to use nightly.

Not much product is needed only one pump covers the entire face but you have to do it carefully to get even distribution of both solutions.

The Dual Overnight Moisturizer goes on smoothly, soothing the skin as I wind down from my day leaving it soft and glowing. The scent became something I looked forward to. I did not notice any huge change to fine lines or wrinkles but I am overall happy with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The brightening duel overnight moisturizer is a great product. It truly does help brighten the skin. I love the fragrance.

"At first, I was hesitant to use Loreal products. My experience with them in the past has been both good and bad. I have to say though, these products are amazing.

"I wanted to like this. I really did. But, sadly, I can't. This moisturizer is big on claims, but lacking on the payoff. All it really did for my skin was dry it out and actually cause some blemishes. And dry skin in winter? No thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love an overnight moisturizer. I'm a long time user of a 'high end' product that basically sits on my skin and ruins pillowcases. L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Overnight Moisturizer is everything I've been looking for. The texture is thick and creamy, but not so think it doesn't absorb into skin. There is a slight scent, but it wears off after a few minutes, so caution if you are nose sensitive. My skin is supple and bright. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have definitely noticed a difference from when I have used night cream and when I wasn't using night cream. I think the night cream helps to keep my face nice and moisturized specially this time of the year when my skin is always so dry. I have a routine of using the whole line of L'Oréal revitalift that I got every night before bed and it really does seem to help my skin get a fresh clean younger look to it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried the line of Revitalift Bright Reveal products (day moisturizer, night moisturizer, cleanser and pads) and the night moisturizer if by far my favorite. I will likely continue using it. My skin feels great after I apply it, dries quickly, and does not leave my skin feeling oily (I have combination skin). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall, I liked this night moisturizer, the dual formula is hydrating, but not overly thick or heavy. I felt that I saw an improvement over a month of use, especially in brightening and reducing the appearance of pores. I did feel it could have been a bit more hydrating, but overall, a nice lightweight moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Not my cup of tea. I tried giving this a good try. I have used it for a fee weeks now and I do not like this. It leaves my skin with this weird film on my face. It just sits on the skin. If I rub my skin I can actually roll up the product in between my fingers. Very weird! Not going to be purchasing this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Duzm Overnight Moisturizer is awesome .I put it on at night and wake to moisturized skin.

My biggest concern with nightime moisturizers is that most of them are greasy and oily. It feels like it all ends up on the pillowcase! This cream felt lighter and smoother. I checked the ingredients before using as well. I am looking forward to keeping it as part of my nighttime routine [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I spend a lot of time outdoors which can sometimes cause my skin to become irritated and dry. Since trying the cleanser I have noticed cleaner and smoother skin. I definitely wanted a product that wouldn't cause any further irritation to my skin. I made certain the ingredients were calming before using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"So, after several weeks of using the overnight moisturizer, along with the other products that came with it, my face is now looking very clear and smooth. These products did not work overnight, but NO products do. I was patient and diligent and am very satisfied with the results. My cheekbones acually look moe defined, too, and this was not a result that I was expecting. I am looking forward to seeing how much better my skin will look with prolonged use. YAY!!

The L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer is fabulous! A little bit goes a long way (much to my surprise. Not much comes out of the pump but it is enough to cover my face). I love that it does not leave an oily residue after using it and the lotion absorbs quickly. It brightens my face and reduces those fine stubborn wrinkle lines. And it doesn't irritate my skin (which is dry and a bit sensitive). My dark spots seem lighter after using it.

"This product has dual action pump which provides two types of formula for overnight. It has retinol which reduces wrinkles an discoloration, as well as glycolic acid which help rejuvenate the skin and vitamin c as well. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am in love with this whole collection! My favorite has to be the nighttime moisturizer. You need one perfectly portion pump for your entire face and neck! It leaves my face feeling moisturized without leaving an oily or sticky feeling. My face looks amazing! I would highly recommend this to everyone!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This lotion definitely does the job at keeping my face moisturized all night. Within 3 weeks, I've noticed my skin is no longer dull, there's a glow to it. I've even noticed more even tone skin & my acne scars seem to not be so noticeable anymore, which is an A+ for me!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's been a few weeks now using this serum, not only at night, but also in the morning. I can see a wonderful difference in my skin. It's brighter and my freckles look lighter. It's also given my skin a toned and tightened look around my forehead. I will be using this religiously in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Thanks BzzAgent for sending me the L'OREAL REVITALIFT BRIGHT REVEAL SCRUB CLEANSER for free to give my review. I love the scent. I also love the way the scrub made my skin feel smooth and look radiant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great overnight moisturizer with anti-aging ingredients. My skin soaked it up quickly and I woke up with a fresh, hydrated face. I didn't feel like this felt sticky or oily when I put it on, which I love. The dual pumps is really cool and I like that it actually gives you the exact amount you need in one easy pump. This is a great overnight Moisturizer. I would definitely buy this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really felt that my face was hydrated with this. It didn't leave my skin feeling greasy which was an added bonus! It did have a slight chemical smell at first but I got used to it soon and don't notice it now. I will definitely continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer is so moisturizing & my skin looks radiant. Even after just 3 weeks of use, I'm seeing great results! This needs to be a staple item in every woman's skin care routine. You won't be disappointed [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I put on the Revitalift Bright Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer at bedtime and before I even went to sleep I could feel it working in my skin. Woke up the next morning and my face felt so soft. Not oily like my other product. I will be changing my overnight cream for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I gave this product only three stars because every time I would apply it, it would end up rolling off my skin as I applied it. I tried applying it alone, without having used the pads, and then I applied it after using the pads, and both times, it rolled off my face. I don't know what I did wrong, but I could not get it to stay on my face. I really wanted this to work cause I like the concept of a dual moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using the Revitalift night moisturizer for a couple of weeks, I am pretty happy with it. It feels slightly sticky when it is first applied, but it absorbs nicely and I wake up with nice, hydrated skin. I have not yet decided if this product will replace my prior night cream, but I like it enough that I am considering purchasing this in the future. If you are looking for a new night moisturizer, this one is worth a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. does not leave your skin greasy and smells great. my skin looks 100% healthier since using this product. It has a great fragrance unlike most moisturizers. I would highly recommend this to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"While overall, I think this product did help my skin, it also left it feeling a bit heavy and greasy. I'd wake up in the morning with oily skin, something I've never had a problem with. It also felt slightly tacky. I only used one pump at night, but that seemed to be too much so I tried cutting back. It didn't matter. It still felt greasy to me. Although, the product DID work at making my skin feel softer after I cleaned it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the Dual Overnight Moisturizer has to be my favorite out of all the Bright Reveal products. Not only does it make your skin feel so soft and smooth , it has a wonderful scent. It does a great job at hydrating my skin. When I wake up in the morning my skin still feels moisturized and soft to the touch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was the best product for my face so far! I look for creams and cleaners that brighten, cleanse, and moisturize with irritation, or gross residue. This loreal was the greatest thing I found so far. Goes on light, quickly absorbs, and my skin feels amazing, fine lines gone or faded to almost nothing, and the dark spot on side of face has vanished. I truly recommend these loreal products, because they are amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This loreal revitalize bright reveal dual overnight cream is very hydrating goes on smooth and does it's job, but hard to tell because my face was left very red from the scrub. I might try just using alone with out the scrub to see if I get better results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the Revitalift line by L'Oréal...my skin has never looked so fresh and vibrant. I have been using the Revitalift Bright Reveal Dual Overnight Moisturizer and the only complaint I have is that it takes a little long to dry..so I've been tidying up my bathroom counter while it dries. Maybe that's not so bad after all?!?!!! My face feels like baby skin and is so smooth and radiant. The scent is just right and I love how the two ""creams"" work together to bring out my best skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the nighttime moisturizer. I would apply it every night after washing my face with the scrub and cleaning it with the pads. My face felt super soft after applying. In the morning when I would wake up my face was still soft and felt smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am still loving all the Revitalift products they have made such a difference in my skin. I feel as if it has taken that dull lifeless skin and made it look 10 years younger. I love the feel and look of my smooth skin and the less wrinkles I see as well. This for sure is my new forever skin care regiment! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Pluses: it's light, goes on the face easily, absobs nicely. Minuses: If you are looking for a non-comedogenic product, it is not! My pores were clogged, and I had a break out. The dual pump bottle is not in sync, so you need to get used to how to pump both sides at the same time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed waking up after applying Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer the night before. I have had sun spots on my face for years. I feel that after a few weeks of using the Overnight Moisturizer that my sun spots are beginning to fade away. The brightening ingredients have been helping my skin look and feel refreshed and energized! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this for 2 weeks now and when it first is applied after cleansing face in the evening it goes on easily feels moisturizing and nice. About an hour after I look in the mirror and notice dried serum (I'm assuming) on my skin. It looks like a white spider web but when I pull it off it balls up. That's why this is not an item that would work well under makeup or primer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am totally thrilled with the results from the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer. The pump dispenses a portion of moisturizer and a portion of serum. There was always enough our of one pump for my entire face and neck. It goes on very smoothly and you can feel your skin drinking it in!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
REVITALIFT BRIGHT REVEAL BRIGHTENING DUAL OVERNIGHT MOISTURIZER WAS A GREAT PRODUCT. IT WAS SUPER LIGHT AND DIDNT FEEL GREASY OR HEAVY LIKE OTHER MOISTURIZERS. I WOKE UP FEELING REFRESHED AND COULD REALLY SEE A DIFFERENCE AFTER ABOUT 2 WEEKS OF USING THESE PRODUCTS. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for about a week and a half and have already noticed a difference. Other products have burned or irritated my skin, but this one does not. When I wake my skin still feels soft and smooth, my pores seem smaller and my makeup goes on smoother. The only complaint would be the scent, it smells good, but a little too strong for the face area. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I fell in love with Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer! It glides on Smooth and it feels super light on your face. It makes your skin feel soft, smooth, and supple and in the morning your face feels absolutely amazing! My skin truly glows after I've used this product! I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this before I go to bed every night. I have very dry skin, even more so in winter. My skin felt very soft after application with no heavy or sticky feeling. The next morning my skin still felt soft. I was very pleased with this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The overnight moisturizer is a fairly good product. I used it after the peel every night. When the weather turns cold, my skin dries out a lot quicker. This may not be heavy enough if you have dry skin. I will apply it once, let it dry, then apply it again. However, you cannot apply it to your eye area. You will need another product for that. I will not be buying this because it is not heavy/deep enough for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only need a bit of moisturizer at night, as my sensitive skin tends to be on the oily side, but, I can't go without, and sometimes it's a challenge to find an appropriate night cream. Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer, when used in about a pea sized portion for me, can be smoothed over any dry and uneven areas, leaving no pesky pillow strains nor facial redness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love the loreal revitalift bright reveal brightening dual night combo.Instantly my skin feels silky smooth after applying it.it's half serem and lotion.it's not sticky smells great too .did I mention it has 30 spf also.I wake up to so soft silky skin I just love it.definitely will buy agian [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer. It went on very easily and worked really well with my skin. I did also like that it combined the serum and moisturizing steps, giving me one less thing to do while getting ready for bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had the opportunity to try Loreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Overnight Moisturizer. I have sensitive skin so I was a bit hesitant if the product would cause irritation, I was pleasantly surprised it did not. This night moisturizer is light weight and easy to apply. It goes on smoothly and immediately my skin felt hydrated, soft, and refreshed! I will continue to use this product as part of my nighttime skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product works well to replenish your skin. When I wake up my skin is moist and refreshed after using this product. It seems to help the moisturizer absorb better. I really like this product. I am telling my family and friends in person after they compliment my how my skin looks. They are telling me I look great and much younger. This applies to all the Revitalift products in this bzzkit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Absolutely love this! Mine is almost gone! One of the BEST night moisturizers I have ever used. This alone is a great purchase! Great smelling, non greasy, easy way to bring the sunshine and moisture back to your skin! Paired with the Scrub and daily lotion this is a great set! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the overnight moisturizer. I have been using it for about a month. I really feel like it does work all night, my face still feels soft in the morning. I'm not really sure if it helps much with fine line/winkles. I did not see any difference there. That's the reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, but it is a good moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used the Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer for a few weeks now. My skin does in fact feel softer with using the whole system, but I can't tell that it is any brighter or that any of my dark spots or uneven skin tone have improved. I also did not like the tacky feel it leaves on my skin. The smell is somewhat citrusy which is fine. I will continue using the system until I've used it, but I doubt I would purchase it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
When I put this on at night it feels so refreshing and it dries fast but is not drying. I love mixing the 2 sides thoroughly together so I know I am getting the full treatment. I treat my neck and face right before bed and it's usually dry within a couple of minutes. In the morning my skin is very soft and I can see as I do the challenge some dark spots have faded and some lines have lessened. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My favorite night cream. I received a sample to try and I have been using it for three weeks and the difference is noticeable. I use this cream every night after i scrub and i used the Loreal pads. My skin is smooth and wrinkles have minimize aswell as my pores. This cream is not oily and i do not wake up with oily skin like i notmally do with other night creams. I have obtain incredible results and will continue to use the Loreal night cream daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer made my skin feel oh so soft, clean and silky. I have been using it every night and I can definitely tell the difference in my skin. It's even better now that the seasons are changing. My skin is not so dry and itchy when I wake up. Now I wake up feeling fresh and clean and moisturized! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the Revitalift Bright reveal overnight moisturizer for a few weeks and my skin seems to break out more. It seems too heavy for my skin which is more normal and a few dry spots here and there. It feels very nice and smooth going on and the pump is easy to use but it just doesn't seem to work well with my skin. I love the peel pads and also the scrub but the overnight moisturizer is too thick for my skin. Would be best for someone with very dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This dual overnight moisturizer is the best. It goes on nicely and stays on all night (I can feel it when I wash my face in the morning) my skin looks more refreshed after using it. Love this stuff. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the overnight lotion - it leaves my skin feeling amazingly soft and smooth! I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin (smoother appearance) since using this system. I believe the overnight lotion is a big part of this. I love the light fragrance and the unique dispenser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product is really good and i can tell that it's working on my crow's feet. However, it feels fairly greasy on the face, and I find myself looking forward to washing it off in the morning. But, I'm willing to deal with it since I can tell a difference!

"I think that the Loreal Revitalift Brightening dual Bright Mosturizer work great. I use it after I use the scrub and pads. I think this bright mosturizes maker your face really soft and it makes your face look brighter with no spots on your face. I love how it has the dual pump and you can just get it and mix it togerther, then adding it to your face leaving it silky smooth and spot free. So far I love this product very much. It works great and I would recommend it to anyone.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the dual overnight cream for a couple of weeks now and my skin is actually cleaning up. I love the way it feel after I put it on . My skin is not greasy at all but smooth .

"I really loved using the Bright Reveal scrub ! I had thought it might be grainy and harsh, but the scrub beads were tiny and sparkling and it just felt so refreshing! I've never been a fan of scrubs until I tried this one ! It honestly feels like your skin is fresh and glowing and new after you use it! I will definitely purchase more once my free product runs out!

I am not a fan of the dual overnight moisturizer...it left my face feeling greasy which I don't like. However my skin did feel amazing the next day...I prefer a night serum rather than greasy creams. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this moisturizer has just the right amount of solution that evens my skin tone, shrinks me pores and doesn't leave it too greasy or too dry. It's perfect! It has a very subtle, pleasant scent as well. I always use a moisturizer at night after cleansing, this moisturizer does a great job. I will continue to use it.

"I don't usually use a night time cream on my face, well not consistent at least, but I have been consistent with Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer and I feel like it's made a drastic difference, when I wake up my skin doesn't look so tired anymore. I am pleased with this product and will continue to buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product from BzzAgent and Loreal Paris in exchange for my honest opinion. This is an excellent product! This overnight moisturizer smells so good!

I have used many creams over the years and I can honestly say this is my favorite. I definitely recommend it. #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"After about a week of using the revitalift double night time moisturizer cream, I broke out around my face with little tiny bumps, almost sandpaper-like .

"I had high hopes for this moisturizer, especially because I'd love to find a replacement for my higher end products. I gave L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal overnight moisturizer a try for three solid weeks but had to go back to my regular products. It made me break out so bad! I had acne over my entire face and I'm 40 years old. I'm not sure what ingredient caused me to break out so badly. Darn! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have been using this in combination with the other products for several weeks now. I am amazed out how bright my skin is. My skin is very red and patchy and while the redness isn't completely gone it's definitely helped even my skin tone out quite a bit. I will continue to use this for sure!

I have been using all of the products in the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal series for a few weeks now. I will admit that my skin seems a bit brighter and I love the cleansing power of the face scrub. I am however disappointed by the overnight moisturizer. It is quite greasy even when you only apply a small amount. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a perfect overnight moisturizer!! I've found with a lot of overnight moisturizers that they are too greasy and make my skin feel gooey. This is the perfect balance. And as a great bonus, it smells great!! So many overnight creams have an unpleasant odor, but I really like this one!! Highly recommended! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the complete Loreal Revitalift skin care line and I'm absolutely LOVING it!!

LOVE IT!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product has no perfume smell. Lightly scented. The product is light and doesn't go on thick. There is no greasy feel to it. Absorbs into my skin and makes my skin feel soft and smooth in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have combination oily skin so it's hard to find the right moisturizer. Often times they feel too thick and sit on top of my skin. This moisturizer felt smooth and absorbed well into my skin. My face looks more revitalized and I feel good having added this step to help my skin overnight while I am sleeping. It is easy to apply and a little goes a long way. I like that it helps fight signs of aging and I have noticed a more even complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"What would I want to know before I get this product?"" It really works! I've been using the products for two weeks. I have sensitive skin and this product has not irritated me. My skin looks brighter and more even toned, I notice my some fine lines have improved. My only dislike is the night products leave my skin a little sticky. All together a MUST have for the ladies!

"I like this product and like the fact that L'Oreal has a complete system with products that work together and complement each other. My skin is oily so this is a bit heavy for summer use but I like it for the winter when my skin is dryer and needs extra moisturizer. The cream has a light, clean scent that didn't bother me- I thought it was pleasant. The cream applies nicely and feels very creamy and emollient. My skin definitely felt moisturized.

I am in love with the entire bright reveal line of products. My much younger coworker told me (I returned to a job after being gone 5 months) that I looked younger and my skin was amazing. I'm 41 years old. That made me feel so thankful for these products Bzzagent agent gave me to review. It has also solidified my trust in the L'Oréal brand. I will definitely be purchasing this entire line! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I think the best part of going to sleep at night is applying L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer.

"Out of all the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection that I had been given to sample, this one was the best product out of all of them but unfortunately for me, it did not do as promised. I felt like it went on smooth and one pump is perfect, but I will be switching back to my original skin treatment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I like the feel of this moisturizer, it is a little greasy for my preference. It isn't so greasy that it causes my face to break out, just leaves it a little greasy feeling. Otherwise, it does a great job of moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is going be the only Moisturizer I be using for overnight now on.Having tried this the last couple weeks I can see great results.When I wake up in morning my skin feels softer and more supple.I had several friends ask me what using.Show them bottle tell them try it same results I got.From now on this going be at top skincare list [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"#GotitFree #L'Oreal I have been using the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer for about a week. I have noticed that my skin is softer and more even. I use this after I use the Peel Pads and the Daily Scrub Cleanser. I am however developing acne in certain areas that I have not previously had before. I am not sure if I am using to much moisturizer, but I am going to cut back on the amount I put on my face to see if this helps. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This overnight moisturizer was great - it felt light and fresh and absorbed quickly. I have fair skin so I didn't see much brightening but I it kept any spots from getting darker or new ones from appearing. It didn't leave a sticky residue on my face or on my pillow. Smelled great too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is hands down the best night cream I've ever used. The dual pump dispenses a cream and a serum, making the formula lightweight and seriously smooth. Absorbs into skin quickly, yet feels immediately hydrated and buttery soft all night. No over powering scent. I wake up with a face so soft and supple that I hate having to wash it off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was immediately delighted. Two tubes, one pump. It just tickles me. The exfoliating liquid is gentle with just a bitty bit of rub. The moisturizer is soft and creamy. It's fun to watch the two colors come out, then kind of mix up as I apply to my face. My face feels so soft in the morning I almost don't want to wash it. I love the entire product line but as an aging women I love even more that after a few short works of use I have visible results that I can see!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
If I could write this product 10 Stars I would. This is by far the best overnight moisturizer I have ever used. I absolutely love the way it feels when I'm putting it on my face. And I can see it working instantly. I can noticeably see a difference in the morning when I wake up. My face is firmer and smoother. I will definitely be using this product again.

"This product is a serum and moisturizer, kept in dual chambers so the products don't mix until you apply it. You only need one pump to cover your whole face and it glides on like silk. I've been using this in conjunction with the other products in this line and I've noticed an improvement in my overall skin tone. It's smoother and more even. And the price point is reasonable. Definitely recommend this!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have dry skin, especially in the cold weather. I get dry patches near my nose and in between my eye brows. This product has helped tremendously! Very moisturizing and it gives me such a nice glow.

"I waited a few weeks before I posted a review of the product. Never have tried any of the L'Oreal Revitalift products. Used daily as directed.

The Dual Overnight Moisturizer has a great texture. A little bit really does go a long way. The only problems I have is that it made me break out a little bit and it makes my skin feel a bit too oily (I have combo skin). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this for a few nights and really did not like the way my face felt it the morning. It was really greasy and I had to wash my face again. To me it seems just too heavy for my skin. I probably will not use it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I usually find it difficult to remember to use a separate overnight moisturizer.

"I was excited to try the Revitalift Bright Reveal line I received free in the mail from #bzzagent however, the only thing bright about it was my face after using it. I think my skin was just too sensitive for it. I cleansed my face with the scrub cleanser followed by the moisturizer. By the time afternoon hit, it felt like my face was on fire. Unfortunately, this product didn't work well for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Light fragrance, light smooth feel. I love that this has sun protection in it too. The container is pretty, too! Great product from a trusted brand. I tend to not like face creams/lotion because almost every one I've tried leave my skin feeling ""heavy and rubbery."" Not true of this one! I received a free sample of this product in exchange for an honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this moisturizer. it goes on smooth and not greasy. I have started noticing that my fine lines around my mouth and eyes shrinking. I like it does not have any scent. I just dab a very small amount onto my finger tip and it goes a long way. I am very happy with this product and will very soon put a big shout out on my facebook page. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I personally didnt like this at all. Every since starting to use it, my facial skin has been more greasy feeling, and breaking out in acne (NOT good for a 40 year old woman!). Sorry, but I cannot recommend this product at all, and I'm going back to my other previously good working one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was really excited to try this new line of Loreal products! I used the whole regimen and have had more breakouts than I ever had in my life! The moisturizer left my skin very tacky and was a little thicker than my normal moisturizer. I wanted to hang in there and use it for longer, but I couldn't afford to have another major breakout. :( [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is a very good one. My face feels so clean and so much smoother the nest morning. This is one item that would suggest to my friends and family to g out and purchase. I will be purchasing this item in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My daughters and i tried it.. I apparently don't need to moisturize that much i had a small breakout on my chin and am not normally prone to acne however i exfoliate religiously but don't normally use a moisturiser..my daughters are impressed and have had no issues..all the products feel and smell great..will continue to use [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love LOREAL REVITALIFT BRIGHT REVEAL DUAL OVERNIGHT MOISTURIZER it absorbs well leaves my skin feeling smooth and fresh, and doesn't leave my skin feeling oily. it has caused my skin to look and feel more healthy. #IGOTITFORFREE [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ugh...I would have never guessed that using this product would lead to a face full of breakouts in the morning - just after one night of using the product. What a bummer! I do not have sensitive skin and do not get breakouts since I am no longer a teen. Far from it actually. I would not recommend this product to anyone! AGain, what a bummer from a well know and popular brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I look forward to every evening that I get to use this moisturizer . It's the Coop DeGraw product! I love scrubbing my face with the Cleanser then using the peel pads and lastly awesome is the Dual Overnight Moisturizer. My skin just feels phenomenal ! Not to dry and not slimy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When using theses peel pads, I can feel the dullness go away and feel refreshed. I think using these product is great they will be replacing my current cleansing product. Thank you Bzzagent for the free products you send me, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is light and feels great on the skin. I do feel that it has helped to even out and brighten my skin. Did not cause breakouts or clog pores. Wish it helped more with my wrinkles though, as claimed. Thank you to BzzAgent for allowing me to try this for free! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that the Loreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Dual Overnight Moisturizer is a great moisturizer. One moisturizer is clear and the other moisturizer is a cream. The moisturizers are not overly greasy, it is just right.It is supposed to gently exfoliate dull skin and infuse brightness with 4% glycolic acid. It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth at night. #got it free#bzzagent♥ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This stuff really works ! I've been using it for 3 weeks now and I've really notice a big difference in my skin tone. My skin tone is a lot more even and brighter. I love how my skin looks. And I really like the products silky feel and citrusy sent . But be careful not to get it around the eyes cause it stings a little lol but that was my fault. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The duel overnight moisturizer is fantastic. I love the light texture of the product. The fragrance is nice. I love how it makes my skin feel. Soft and smooth. Other night products seem to make my skin burn. The Duel Overnight Moisture never burns and it is easy to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have a love /hate relationship with the L'Oréal Paris Bright Reveal Line ,and this one is all love! This dual overnight moisturizer was my absolute favorite!

This product I Did notice made a huge difference in plumping/smoothing my skin by morning! #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer for 30 days now along with the cleanser and peel pads. My skin tone is much more even and less dull. I like the fragrance and how it makes my face feel. I also like that it has a pump which gives you the amount needed per use. My skin was looking blotchy and dull before using this line of skin care. I am very happy with the results and will continue to use the products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think every woman out there should try these great products out! I was so pleasantly surprised at not only how quickly I got noticeable results, but that my skin just keeps getting better and better each day that I continue to use these!

It has seriously been a game changer for me as it has worked wonders at keeping my skin happy, healthy, and hydrated. I will never use another mouisturizer ever again as this is now my go to skin care product without a doubt. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The jury is still out since I haven't been using the product for a full 30 days yet, but I'm happy with the daily regimine so far. I am loyal to my usual brand but am giving L'Oréal 30 day challenge 100%! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As a BzzAgent I got to try L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer for Free! This overnight moisturizer is wonderful.

"The dual overnight moisturizer is great. I love how it moisturizes my skin without feeling too heavy like some creams I've used in the past. Also, I noticed it didn't make my skin breakout, which I'll admit I was a bit nervous about. I would definitely recommend this to friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Not only is my face getting softer and clearer and evening out its getting smoother. L'Oreal overnight moisturizer is super great. Ive been using this for more than a week and I think my skin is really enjoying the nightly drink of this light cream. Its easy to use and seems to be working wonders for me at forty.

"Since receiving my kit , I have been very carefully following the skin routine everyday.I have yet to see or feel any difference as far as evening the tones in my skin. The wiping pads dont leave a clean feeling and in fact using these products feels ""sticky"".The citrus smell is nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think i am starting to see a small difference! I am going to keep trying it. Although I stopped using the peel pads, one of the products broke my right eye lid out, small bumps itchy, all over it. I am strictly using the wash and moisturizers [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Before trying the L'Oreal Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer in this promotion I was kind of skeptical as to how good it worked. After trying the product I am hooked. This product left my skin feeling soft and I can notice a decrease in puffiness around my eyes and some of the aging lines. I will definitely by this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have really dry skin, and the colder weather don't help. I have been using the Reveal Dual Overnight Moisturizer for 30 days now and my face is smoother, blemishes have started to disappear and I feel rejuvenated in the AM when I use the daily scrub followed by the bright reveal. I haven't ever been so happy with face .... I would suggest this product to anyone with dry skin like mine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I am loving the dual revitalift bright reveal from L'Oréal. I have been using this for almost three weeks. My husband told me yesterday that my skin looks smooth and has less lines. I wake up and feel that my skin is healthier. it only takes a little bit to cover your face. Just be careful not to get any in your eyes because it will burn. Love love love this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oreal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer is the easiest product to use for softer, brighter and younger looking skin. I have been using the full line of Revitalift Bright Reveal for 10 days and can already see improvement in the look and feel of my skin. I'm so excited about the coming holidays to show off my healthier appearance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Another part of the line that I wanted to love. Loved the idea of a night moisturizer combined with serum. As soon as I applied I felt grease, scared to sleep on my stomach since oil would get on my pillowcase. Didn't get absorbed into my skin like I was in hope that it would. My kids didn't even want to kiss me goodnight, their lips felt gross. Never again...I'm sure all the oils they used in this line cause the acne breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The night Cream was good it was just a tad bit greasy for my liking. In the morning when I woke up and wash my face I could still feel the cream washing off However in the morning I did notice that my face wasn't as dry as it normally was and I also noticed that it helped tight in my skin somewhat and reveal more brightness Definitely a product I will buy in the future and recommend to anyone [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This overnight moisturizer really moisturizes well. It has a nice, light fragrance and doesn't irritate my facial skin. I haven't used it long enough to get the promised results, but I'm hopeful. There is one small complaint I have, thus the 4-star rating, and that is that it takes a long time to absorb leaving my face 'sticky'. Overall, this seems to be a good moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used the night lotion for several weeks and I'm pretty happy with it. I can't really tell whether it's had any effect on my skin as to 'looking younger' but I like how easy it is to use and how smoothly it goes on. And it does keep my skin feeling hydrated so, it's all right. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received the Loreal revitalift products and couldn't wait to try them. All was well for a few days then I broke out. As soon as I stopped using these Revitalift products the acne cleared up. I am hoping that if I try each product individually I can weed out the offender. I did enjoy the daily scrub cleanser and the brightening pads. I hope I have better luck using those alone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am a BzzAgent and was given Loreal 's revitalift bright reveal brightening dual overnight moisturizer to try. This is my favorite item from the revitalift bright reveal line. It feels so silky and amazing, plus i saw huge difference in my skin in just 1 short week. I am about to turn 40 and fine lines and dark spots have been popping up everywhere, and with Loreal's new revitalift bright reveal line I can head into my 40s looking better than i did in my 30s.

"Now that winter is coming, my skin is getting drier. I liked the idea of using a cream at night to help prevent flakes on my face. However, the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer made my face feel a bit too greasy, and within a few days of use, I developed a lot of whiteheads. After a week or so, the acne got worse so I discontinued using the moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had high hopes for this night serum, but I had several blemishes that came after a week of use that went away with 3 days of stopping. I liked the scent and the overall feel. It was not too heavy but gave me enough moisture to feel nice in the Fall. The cleanser and peel pads are great and I didn't have any issue with those. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wow! The first time I used the Revitalift overnight moisturizer my skin was so soft the next morning. I have been using it for 2 weeks and have noticed a nice change in my skin. My skin is softer, brighter, and the rough patch on my forehead is gone. Even my husband noticed how much brighter my skin is. The moisturizer absorbed quickly and doesn't have a harsh smell. I am hooked! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer for a week now.

"After a couple weeks of using all of the products in the Revitalift Bright Reveal campaign, I definitely see a difference in the brightness and tone of my skin. I will probably keep using some of the products - especially the overnight moisturizer. I would recommend the products to others to help brighten and even out skin tone. Love this campaign! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer. Both ingredients combine to work overnight so that when I wake up in the morning my face is moisturized and bright. It allows for a fresher and brighter look. I will use this line for all my facial needs for today and the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This stuff is the bomb..it sure has helped alot and would recommend it to everyone and anyone and will continue to buy after my product is gone..my face has such a glow to it that it hadn't had before. I use all 4 of the products that i received and i couldn't be happier..Thank you BzzAgent!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product is not good for my skin, it didn't brighten my skin nor nourish it. My face will turn dark after applying it and after two days my skin stopped absorbing the cream so I just left out with white cream layers on my face. I appreciate the fact that they send me the actual size of the product but so disappointed from the results I had! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer for about 2 weeks now and cannot get over how great my results are! The appearance of wrinkles and uneven skin tone has greatly diminished. Definitely the most effective treatment I have used for brighter, more radiant and younger-looking skin. I just love how soft and smooth and clear my face is now, this product is a keeper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm quickly approaching 50 and my skin is not as youthful as it once was. I had very high hopes for this product. The first few days things went well, however after several I noticed my usually clear skin breaking out! Then the shine began to surface on my skin by mid morning, which made my skin appear greasy. I have noticed the overall tone of my skin is smoother. Not sure I would purchase the complete set, may be to strong for my skin. I do enjoy the scrub.... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the L'Oreal Revitalift Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer is fabulous! It felt great on my skin! This moisturizer does exactly what it says it will do. My skin is softer, brighter, age spots lighter, and skin tone no longer blotchy. This is my new nighttime moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this line of product, ""Loreal"" is a very good moisturizer for during the day, it adds lot of moisture and you can actually feel the difference, I am not to sure about helping with the wrinkles I think it would take longer for that to clear and disappear, but helps in keeping my skin looking clearer and even. Has SPF30 which helps with being outdoors. Overall so far so good. Helps with acne as well. Keeps me less oily and it not as oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use the L'Oréal Dual Overnight Moisturizer as directed which is after I clean my face with the L'Oréal Daily Scrub and then use the L'Oréal Peel Pads, and then finally I use the Dual Moisturizer. I love this stuff. It feels so gentle going on and it actually feels like I have a protective layer on my skin to work its magic while I sleep. When I wake up and wash my face I can feel the magic wash away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this Dual Overnight Moisturizer night cream. I apply the moisturizer daily before bed. I definitely see change in my skin texture. My skin now looks smoother and prettier. I have sensitive skin and I haven't had any redness or irritation. I can honestly say that this is an great product and I am very much satisfied with the Dual Moisturizer.

"I have been using L'Oreal Revitalife Bright Reveal for a couple weeks. The face scrub is very gentle. The moisturizers work very well. You don't have a greasy feeling after applying. The Peel pads, leave your face feeling fresh and clean. But, I don't see any changes yet! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a nice accompaniment to the Bright Reveal Daily Scrub. Light citrus scent, soothing formula, and doesn't feel greasy. Be sure to mix the serum and moisturizer as it does come out of separate nozzles when pumped. #gotitfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I think the Revitalift Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer is great considering I have never used a night Creme before. I never wanted to even try one because I didn't think it was ever worth a try. I thought a night creme would feel heavy, greasy and uncomfortable. Total opposite is what this product is. When I apply this at night, my skin feels clean, fresh, airy, breezy and soft! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that L'Oréal 's Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer is the best nighttime moisturizer I have ever used. Skin is not left oily. It leaves skin smooth, bright, and diminishes my wrinkles. I love the dual sided pump which uses glycolic acid, pro-retinol, and vitamin C. This Moisturizer made my skin glow, diminished wrinkles made my skin look healthier in a week. My skin didn't look this good when I was a teenager!

"I've been using L'Oreal brightening dual overnight moisturizer for about 3 weeks or so, I applied it before I went to bed every night.. I can TOTALLY tell that I've been using L'Oreal's Revitalift products! My face looks brighter and healthier. I had several age spots on my face and they faded dramatically. It has a pleasant scent and was very easy to use and to apply to face. #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have sensitive skin and are prone to breakouts. I was a little skeptical to try this moisturizer, but found that after about a week of use my skin had no adverse reactions. I love how the clear gel combines with the creamy moisturizer. Giving it a slight cooling effect along with a velvet like feel when dry. My skin looks and feels great since using the Overnight moisturizer. And it also seems that a little goes a long way. I am definitely buying this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Revivalist overnight moisturizer is a very impressive product. It has a cool bottle that combines a gel and a moisturizer and when you mix it in your hand it creates a very light moisturizing fast drying Potion that has already made a difference in my fine lines around my mouth and eyes and just a week use. I am excited to post again in the next few days with a picture hopefully with more improvement to come! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried this a few times and was pretty pleased. It absorbs into the skin fairly quickly. The next morning my skin felt nice and moisturized without feeling greasy. So far so good! I will keep on trying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this moisturizer! I have oily skin, and most of the previous moisturizers I have used would just sit on top of my face, and I'd wake up with enough oil on my face to make a cake! Not so with the L'Oreal Overnight Moisturizer! I wake up and my skin is brighter, and smoother! I love it! I've even seen a reduction in redness with this stuff! It's definitely going to be a part of my routine from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first I did not care of this as it made my skin feel super slick and greasy (I think I may have used to much the first couple times as well)...but once my skin absorbed all of the moisture and I was using less, it was baby soft and felt amazing!

"I have been using this moisturizer at night for about a week now. It is a very interesting moisturizer, where two different product squirt out together. One is a gel and the other is a cream. Mix them together and spread on your face. They rub in nicely and dry quickly. Doesn't flake off and leaves your face feeling great! From using this whole system for just one week, I can already start to notice a difference on the fine lines around my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love the dual overnight moisturizer. I thing the fresh lemony scent is fabulous. A small pump of the moisturizer goes a long way. I have also been using it on my neck. When I rinse my face in the morning I feel like I am rinsing off the moisturizer. It makes me feel like it has been working all night. I think that works for a night cream. I am hoping L'Oréal will bundle the. Right reveal set at a good price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I am very impressed by the Dual Overnight Moisturizer. Some that i have tried in the past seem to rub off while you sleep, due to tossing and turning, and really show no results. I have been using this for a week and my face looks healthier and shinier. My skin is not dry and flaky anymore. My daughter even noticed the difference and that's just in one week. Can't wait to see what my skin looks like at the end of the 30 days!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"If you are looking for a lightweight, overnight moisturizer that sinks into your skin with no heavy or greasy feel, this is the one! Apply just before bedtime and you're done. The results were noticeable within 1 week. Will definitely keep this product on hand in the future. Having very sensitive skin made me reluctant to try this product...but I am so glad I did.

I love the smell of this. It glides on my skin and make it feel like porcelain! I've been using this entire kit and I will definitely purchase this once I run out. My skin feels soft and fresh when I wake up in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the dual tubes of serum and moisturizer, it definitely saves a step if you need both. You just need to press evenly to get both together in the same amount. But the smell is nice, there's no residue like some serums leave, and it absorbs fast. I actually tried the whole system together. I didn't break out or notice too much oil or dryness. Unfortunately, I didn't notice a lot of brightening or change either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"The Revitalift Reveal Brightening Overnight Moisturizer has all the ingredients I use in one bottle! The lotion is lightweight, non greasy and absorbs quickly so nothing comes off on your pillows. I also like the soft fragrance the product has. I've already started telling my girlfriends to look for these products in the store! I am already pleased with how soft my skin has become and look forward to the added perks with continued use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First, I do like how my skin feels after applying this night time moisturizer, but please tell me why it smells like sunscreen and according the ingredients, it has sunscreen in it? I'm going to bed, not to lay in the sun! I think they could have left this out, it is unnecessary and it adds to the potential problems one might have with it. My skin is softer but now it is also filled with blackheads and tiny pimples. I don't need SPF overload!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer works well for me. It's not irritating or harmful to my skin. It has a pleasant smell and not overwhelming and leaves my skin hydrated and soft. I feel that it's working overnight on helping my skin to appear brighter and healthier! My before and after pic is proof! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I was a little hasty on leaving , old cream butI wanted to try this new product L'Oreal Revitalift Reveal Dual overnight moisture and right away I can. Feel the lotion being a little thicker and it felt so fresh on my face . I woke up with a smooth fresh face I can't stop talking about it to my friends. This is really worth it.

"I liked this moisturizer and thought it did a good job keeping the face moisturized overnight. My skin felt smooth and non greasy. It made me feel confident that my skin was getting the nourishment it needed. I think it did make me break out a little in the first week as my skin was getting used to the glycolic acid and/or retinol ingredients. But, after a week, my few breakouts cleared up fine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thought I would share a picture of my before and after! After 2 weeks of continue use I am a customer for life!!! At first it did make my face break out a little bit, but after several days it cleared right up! Would you guess that next Saturday I will be 41 years old!! This stuff makes me look young!! I am an out spoken person if I don't like something you would know it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Loreal-Revitalift for almost 2 weeks now and I can't believe the amazing results I have experienced. I will be going out to buy more of this product when my sample is gone. I have seen my face look so young in many years. The small wrinkles that I have on my face have almost disappeared. I am telling my friends how wonderful this product is for skin tone, clarity and wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Bright Reveal overnight duo is really nice. In combination with the glycolic peel pads, my skin feels really smooth and right. I've used professional products that made my skin feel this same way. The only thing I wish is that it was more natural...hate putting so many chemicals in and on my body. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer brightens and improves tone almost immediately! I noticed a definite difference in just a few days. It does what it says. The only drawback someone trying this may have is the slight burning sensation. I didn't have a difficulty with it, but I think sensitive skins may have a problem. Otherwise this is the best I have tried yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product about 2 weeks. I have noticed a big difference in my skin tone. Also my skin doesn't feel as dry all day. Knowing it also has a spf is also a great addition.

It makes my face look brighter and more youthful looking. After just a few uses, I saw a significant difference in my skin. I have been using the Revitalift skin care system for over 2 weeks and I am amazed at the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using my Brightening peel pads for a few weeks and I have definitely noticed a difference. My over all skin tone has evened out. Only downside was a bit of drying out around my nose but with use of the moisturizer it isn't a problem. #gotitfree #bzzagent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have tried this product 2 times so far and have to say I have been pleasantly surprised by it. When I initially put it on my finger, it had the appearance of looking like it could possibly have a greasy feel. It was exactly the opposite! It was silky smooth and absorbed very quickly in to my skin. I was concerned about possible redness due to the glycolic acid but so far it has been a-ok.

I think it is safe to say I found my new skin care regimen. Thank you L'Oreal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the Revitalift Brightening dual moisturizer by Loreal is helping my skin tone even out and look less dull. I have been using it several weeks and already notice a difference in my face. The fine lines are diminishing and I feel brighter and more youthful. It is so cool how the product comes out of two tubes simultaneously with the two different moisturizers. It is great even for sensitive skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product does exactly what it says it does. It doesn't have any kind of scent. Absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling smooth and soft.

The value and packaging are great. The pump is a great way to keep the creams from having extra bacteria and it blends the ingredients. This is a wonderful night cream. It is a lot lighter than night creams I have used in the past and I can barely tell I have anything on my face. I have had good overall results and have already recommended the product to my mom. Thanks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It is amazing! 'My skin is brighter and so soft! My dull, tired, little time for me mom face now glows. The old acne scars are fading. My skin is very sensitive and this did not give me a painful dry or burning skin. I'm sold! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This overnight moisturizer is amazing!! I never wear anything overnight because it feels too greasy and heavy and usually breaks me out. This stuff is lightweight and feels like a serum and a moisturizer so no need to do both!!! My skin feels bright and totally refreshed by morning.. no heaviness or breakouts! Love this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I hate it when I can feel a product on my skin. This dual moisturizer just doesn't seem to absorb. It feels sticky and I am afraid it's going to get on my pillowcases and sheets. It's just gross feeling on my skin I stopped using it after the first week it was just too much. I would give it no stars if I could. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i put on revitalift bright reveal brightening dual overnight moisturizer last night and my skin is so dewy with glowing , it looks like i had 8 hours of sleep because my face looks so fresh and bright that it looks like im less tired. now thats a moisturizer everybody needs and worth talking about [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product line is great so far. The price is great for me for what it does. I got this kit free from bzzagent but I looked at the price and was amazed. I have paid alot more for products that don't work half as good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Really wonderful revitalizing overnight skin cream. I have really sensitive combination skin. After using the scrub and cleansing pads I applied the overnight cream. I applied it to both my face and neck. It feel a little sticky at feel first but the dried completely. I woke to smooth glistening skin. It has become a part of my nighttime skin care routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
if you're looking for a great moisturizer than look for no further!!! I absolutely love this moisturizer!!! The texture of it is so creamy and it feels so good on the skin. It comes with dual moisturizers that are very hydrating and my skin just soaks it up! I definitely saw a difference in how my skin looked after the very first use. My skin looked brighter and healthier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this product along with the other products from the collection. I like the fact that this moisturizer really does exactly what it says. I had acne scars that weren't that bad on my chin. But since using this moisturizer I've noticed or should I say I haven't noticed them anymore. My face looks and feels younger! I love the fact that this still is working on my face overnight to reveal fresher and younger skin in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Overall the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Collection is great and has really revealed brighter fresher skin, my only problem has been when I use the Over night product, my skin is somewhat sensitive so I have to skip the over night part of the Bright Reveal routine. #gotitfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I first started the 30 day challenge I figured it would go like every other skin care regimen. I was so wrong! I absolutely love this product, I can't say enough about it. Especially the night time moisturizer. Usually after using an overnight moisturizer you wake up with oily skin that feels greasy. Not with Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer. My skin feels so soft and silky every morning I just want to rub a bunny or puppy all over it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer. One pump is all I need for my whole face & neck. It is non greasy & very moisturizing.

"I have fallen in love with this product. My skin has never been so smooth and soft. I swear it is softer than my 5 year old's and his is very soft! I've not been very good about taking care of my skin but with revitalift, I actually look forward to it! At 42, I'm lucky I look much younger, I will definitely continue using this to try and keep looking young! Also, after the first week, my husband said ""you better not be pregnant"" because my skin was glowing!! I am in love!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product has a nice light scent and felt amazing as I put it on my skin. Unfortunately, it does not absorb well and my face was left sticking to my pillow all night. I wouldn't purchase this product. After using all 4 products in the line, my skin had a little bit of a breakout. Do not know if this was related or not. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't like Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer. It felt very heavy, and greasy on my skin. I had to stop using it after 3 days, because I really didn't like how it made my skin feel. I would not buy this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The moisturizer left my face feeling moisturized, but it gave me a heavy feeling. As though there was too much product on my skin. It took a while to absorb in my skin as well. But when it did my skin was soft and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using the products for a few days, I experienced burning and redness that was progressively worse after each time. I understand that the glycol could cause minor irritation, but this was equivalent to a sunburn. Due to the adverse reaction my skin is experiencing, I will not continue this bzz. Please accept my sincere apologies. I just don't want to use a product that is hurting rather than helping my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so surprised when the overnight cmoisturizer came out in 2 separate ""streams"" that you then mixed together. Loved the concept of dual cartridges then mix together of cream and gel. Goes on smooth, not sticky or thick . Great fresh scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was already using L'Oreal's Overnight Revitalift cream but when I tried this cream with the serum as a promotional item to try, my skin was super soft the next morning. My face illuminated and you can see the skin tight and rejuvenated. I love it and will not trade it for any other, so far. :-) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the whole product line as directed, and when I used this Overnight Moisturizer it made my face feel heavy and very oily.

For the first time ever there is a night time moisturizer that doesn't make me wake up with an extremely oily face. I've been using it for a week and not once has my face been oily in the morning.

"I really like this moisturizer. It is uniquely dispensed in a two part system that combine into an easy to apply bead of moisturizer. It feels great on my skin and I am a firm believer in moisturizing, so I would have stuck with it no matter what, but what happened next truly did amaze me. I started to notice my face looking brighter, fresher, and dare I say younger. I am convinced. I am in love. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ive never used a dual bottled moisturizer before. One side has a creamy moisturizer and the other side is a clear, and more liquidy, serum like lotion. After I mixed them together in my palm and applied them to my face abd neck my skin felt hydrated and light. So far, I like this product as a step in my night time routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the overnight moisturizer was good. It was a combination of oil and lotion in dual chambers that you must mix together in your hand prior to applying. It felt slightly greasy but i feel that I have gotten good results thus far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I think this product just hits the spot for my face. It made me feel nice and hydrated that I know my face appreciated it. Easy pump to use not sticky on your face or fingers.

"The Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer is the perfect companion to the Reveal Brightening Daytime Moisturizer. It goes on feeling light and non greasy.

This is a really nice overnight moisturizer. A very tiny bit covers my entire face and neck. It spreads evenly and smoothly over my skin.

I LOVE the smell of this lotion! This is my favorite of the two lotions I'm trying as part of the 30 Day Challenge. My face feels so silky soft that I can't stop touching it. It smells light and citrus-y and absorbs quickly into my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the bottle design with the 2 chambers for the serum/lotion however I had a difficult time getting them both to come out evenly, at the same time. this resulted in getting more of the lotion and less of the serum. This was my first night using it so I haven't seen any results yet but I am eager to see what happens as the days go on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
this night serum and cream blend works great. I have been using it for 10 days and see a slight improvement in my skin appearance. It is very soothing and in the morning my skin is still soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love that it has a serum and moisturizer in separate compartments that pump out at the same time and amounts. It smells amazing and leaves your skin feeling supply. I apply it down my neck and chest as well. While I've only been using it a short time, results are still minimal if any. It absorbs quickly, not sticky or greasy. I would definitely recommend this as using a nighttime moisturizer is essential for every woman regardless of your age or skin condition. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that the Brightening dual overnight moisturizer is amazing! It moisturizes my face and makes it feel so smooth like it hasn't in years! Would Recommend to all even if you have sensitive skin. It's truly a great product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am loving this whole product line. The night time moisturizer comes in a dual chambered pump bottle (both chambers feed into the same nozzle). I find that one pump is enough for my whole face. There is a slightly floral scent to this lotion. I did not experience any irritation after using this product. I am hoping to keep this product in my skincare arsenal to continue combating the signs of aging. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have recently been using the Revitalift Dual Overnight Moisturizer, and I really notice a difference. The container is unique looking, and when you press the top button to get the cream out, one side is clear and the other is white. This is because there's an exfoliator and an infusing cream in one product! I notice that the tone of my skin is more even and I also see some wrinkles smoothing out! I am very happy with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've put the moisturizer on after I had scrubbed and used the peel pad. I gave this product a 4 because I didn't like the sticky and dry sensation on my face. But this is the first time I try this product. I hope on my next review I can give you great news. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love L'Oréal products and this did not disappoint. This product is much lighter than the daytime moisturizer. It absorbs easily into the skin. Skin does not have that greasy feel. My skin was left smooth. the smell is a plus! My skin was left soft. I felt like it left my skin with a glow! Bright Reveal holds true to its name! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The 3rd step for the night regimen is the dual moisterizer. The first thing I noticed is how cool looking the bottle was! It looked very sleek and sophisticated. After I got over how cool the bottle was, I gently pushed down on the center of the pump. I gently combined the moisturizers and applied to my face. It is very soothing, especially after the peel pad! It has a refreshing, light citrus scent and leaves my face so smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm a sucker for beauty products and love trying everything from the lower end products to the higher end. Today I tried the brightening daily scrub cleanser and loved how it felt on my skin while scrubbing my face this morning. I believe one of the keys to looking younger than I am is taking care of my face the same way I take care of my body. I will definitely experiment with all the revitalization products for the next month and see the difference they make! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I'm usually worried about moisturizer after cleaning but this kept the fresh clean feeling going. The scent was a bit stronger then the cleanser but by no means bothersome. My skin absorbed the product easily and stayed put overnight. When I work up I noticed that it was still ""working"" well enough that I didn't dry out like I usually do. Hooray!

"I can't say enough about Bright Reveal overnight moisturizer. First of all it's light but the moisture is strong with this one, it has a very silky soft feel you have to feel to appreciate. My skin looked dewy and was incredibly soft after application but the next morning? Yea my skin looked amazing, so amazing I skipped my tinted moisturizing lotion and left the house naked. We will see how I look in a week but it's only been 2 days and I'm loving the entire line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just got this today, and tried it out. I like the way it felt going on my skin. Very smooth and I can tell there is something on my skin, yet it does not leave a heavy feeling like other night creams have done. I know this is a good brand name, so I'm praying that it will work as much as they state, cause my face is very dull looking [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Loving this night cream. Only have had it for a week and I already notice a difference, my skin is more moist, even, and I haven't broken out from using this. I am middle 30's and I have conbination skin and I have noticed that my skin is no longer quite as oily as it has been. My pores are even smaller than they used to be. It definitely worked for me!

"I used about a pump and a half of this and it was enough to smooth down my neck and also rub on the backs of my hands. It felt a tiny bit heavy at first but by the morning, it had soaked completely into my skin. I'm looking forward to long term results and this is an easy step to do before bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the nighttime moisturizer. I used as directed after cleansing and doing the pads as well. This to me was not too heavy or thick feeling on my face. My skin felt much smoother and softer after just one use. I have a few darker spots I am hoping will fade with time after using the bright reveal regimen.

"I was so excited to get this product. I'm always looking for new skin brightening products. I'm so pleased with this so far. I will keep using it, and keep y'all updated. So far, so awesome! If you aren't a bzzagent- go sign up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was completely surprised that I fell in love with this nighttime moisturizer. It goes on like a gel and does not feel heavy or greasy. It absorbs quickly and does not break me out or leave my combination skin oily. It has a fresh orange smell and it's great for sensitive skin. I am super impressed and will be purchasing this in the future. I feel like my skin texture has improved as well as my sun spots have lightened. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Silky smooth, creamy and soft to the skin. It was non oily and non greasy...a lot went along way. My skin has felt softer and a bit more ""glowing"" during the day. Perhaps it's much more hydrated from the moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the overnight facial lotion is so nice! I love the dual pump, (exfoliate and infuse). I also used the pads and I really like how my face feels so clean and the overnight lotion is light enough, but enough where you can feel the difference. Thanks again to L'Oréal and Bzzagent.com! I'm really excited to try the day facial lotion tomorrow morning! ! I think this is a really great line of skin care. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal and my skin feels so good and vibrant and smooth, I was amazed at how good and healthy my skin looked, it was simply glowing. It even helped with my dark circles under my eyes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The night moisturizer was a game changer for me! It was so nice going on after washing my face with the daily scrub before bed. It was not at all greasy and went on nice and even. It smells wonderful and I woke up with fresh bright skin. This will be added to my skin care regime. I've even had a feel people ask me if I had a facial since trying this line of skin care products.

I think this L'Oréal overnight moisturizer is amazing. It seriously had my skin feeling silky smooth in the morning.

"So far so good, I have been using this for the past few days and I can say that I do feel and notice a difference. My face feels way smoother and softer. I also see my lines on my eyes looking a bit smoother. I like how easy it is to apply and does not leave any sticky feeling and it is not too heavy. It also has a pleasant scent. I would definitely recommend this to all females because it does seem to be working. I am hoping to see even better results as I keep using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Absorbs Quickly, Goes On Smoothly, Moisturizes Well, Smells Great. I also like that It's SPF 30 Moisturizer. I onlyly been using a few days but makes my skin feel smooth and soft.

The product penetrates the skin rather than sitting on top of it like a lot of overnight creams do. I could feel a difference in my skin the very next morning! I am very picky about night creams but this one checks all of my boxes. It's unscented which I love. My skin didn't stick to my pillowcase like some heavy creams do. This product has replaced my very expensive department store brand. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product. It gives the skin a wonderful feel of being very moisturized with a glow to it. This product makes even my hands feel very moisturized, and yes, I do use in on my hands at night. I just couldn't help it!!! So thankful for the chance to try the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer. PS.... So does my skin!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this formula. It's creamy and goes on great. When I wake up in the morning my skin is not dry and flaky. It it well moisturized. I tend to have sensitive skin, and this did not bother my skin at all. Normally, I use Aveeno for a overnight moisturizer. An important thing to know about this product before buying is, it will cause some sensitivity with sun exposure. So, don't forget to put on sunscreen if you plan on spending time outside. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is amazing and in a very different way of application. The bottle has two separate containers that are hooked together and pump out the moisturizer and serum at the same time that you can mix and apply. My skin feels cooled down when I apply it and it spreads super soft and evenly. The next morning my skin feels moisturized and brighter. The product has a light pleasant fragrance which Is very nice. Very nice product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer helped my skin become so soft and smooth. I would recommend the whole line of the products. They also have a nice scent to them as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I wash my face daily with the collection scrub and then i use the pads and last the overnight moisturizer , i been keeping this routine for one week now and i wake up to a bright and soft skin. I know that at the end of the challenge ( 30 days) my skin will be younger looking and feeling great . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am loving using this product on my skin before bed. Especially the dual overnight moisturizer. My skin is very dry in the winter and this lotion is amazing. I wake up with my skin looking refreshed and soft. The effects this overnight lotion is having on my skin are exciting and obvious. Even my husband has noticed my skin is looking more even and radiant. My wrinkles look finer and less visible as well as the unevenness my skin tone. Did I mention it smells fantastic !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My face gets very dry, so it is important for me to have a great Moisturizer that I can rely on. I am in love with this product as it has helped my skin retain moisture and I have even had less break-outs. That is a big deal to me because I have had regular breakouts since I was a teenager. I would definitley purchase this product as it has helped my skin for the better! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product feels amazing! It's the perfect blend between totally moisturizing and not too oily or heavy. I prefer night creams that go on smooth and feel light and this certainly fits the bill. Plus the bottle is beautiful and looks nice enough to leave out on the counter. I would definitely recommend buying this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like how this moisturizer gives me brighter and smoother looking complexion. Out of all of the four products I tried in the L'oreal Revitalift line, this may be my least favorite only because it does make my face feel pretty oily after I put it on. Since it's made to be used at night, it's not such a big deal because you are just going to sleep! This product is definitely going on my products to keep using list! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loving this moisturizer in the Revitalift Line. The Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer leaves my skin feeling clean and smooth. A nice way to pamper my skin overnight from the damage the sun, pollution and my make-up have done during the day. My skin is softer and brighter within the first week of using the line, but I have to say that the Overnight Moisturizer make my skin glow like it hasn't in years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think would want to know is if this product works, honestly, before I got tit. This is the best overnight product that I have tried, hands down. The steps are easy to follow. The product is lightweight, and with a moisturizer in it, dual. I don't feel greasy after using it. And in the morning, I am noticing the fading of uneven tone in my face, and my skin is looking younger, I just got carded and I am 37 years old. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for a week. I was nervous using moisturizer on my skin because I struggle with adult acne; however, my face has cleared up. I like the fact that there are 2 different types of moisturizers offered in the overnight moisturizer. My face feels so soft after using it. There isn't a heavy smell to the product so there is no issue w/my husband complaining that he can smell it when we go to bed. (That has been a problem w/other products). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I told all my girlfriends, family members, coworkers and clients about theses wonderful new products from L'Oréal. My skin looks youthful and hydrated. I also have a more even skin tone. They want to try them too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think all these products work better when used together, instead of using one at a time. I like the way it has helped my skin look a lot more even toned and some of the ""fine lines"" seem to not look near as bad. Over all I really like these products and I can tell a difference in my skin. I love the scrub cleanser the best. I feel it really gets into my pores and cleans my skin really well.

I have been using this product and nght I was a bit courageous trying something new but I am so glad L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal overnight Moisterizer brightening dual is simply amazing I feel so clean and fresh and wake up so refreshed my face looks renewed .

I wear this every night after removing my makeup. Thank you BzzAgent for allowing me to test this amazing product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love the overnight moisturizer. I put it on after i scrub my face with the brightning peel pads and it makes a difference. My skin feels so soft and looks so bright after just a few days of using it..Very impressed with it and can't wait to keep seeing more results!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that the night cream is a perfect texture and consistency. It is not too heavy. I also like the fact that it does not have a fragrance. I have used some night creams that are just too overpowering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

My skin gets real dry and sunburnt working on a horse farm. I only used this skin care routine with this moisturizer for a few days as a Bzz agent and I can actually feel the difference right away. It blends in my skin well and takes away my irritating dryness and leaves my skin soft too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the Dual Overnight Moisturizer every evening after showering. The moisturizer is very light yet you can definitely feel the difference after a few uses. One pump is enough to cover my whole face and I even spread it down onto my neck area. I am glad to have tried this overnight cream as I probably would not have purchased it on my own. I especially like that I can go to bed after using without feeling like it will get all over my pillow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have only been using these set of product for a little over a week. But I can already tell my skin is smoother, brighter, fine lines and wrinkles are reducing and my poops have actually started to tighten. There was a little initial redness as with any new product but that cleared right up! I truly love L'Oréal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using step one and two you have to moisturize! In my opinion this overnight moisturizer needs to be a bit heavier on the moisture. I had to add another moisturizer ontop of this one to make my skin pop back. For people that have oily skin I am sure it works great. But there needs to be different levels. My face/skin tends to be on the dry side. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This moisturizer is great. It makes my skin feel soft and smooth without feeling greasy and bogged down. And it has a light, pleasant scent to it.

"I really like this night moisturizer. I like that dispenser mixes the serum and lotion as you dispense it in your hand. I also like that you don't need a lot. With some night moisturizers you have to apply a lot. I only used a small amount and my face felt really moisturized. There is no greasy feel and when I wake up in the morning, my face is really soft. I really like this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Definitely a brighter, more even-toned appearance after my new regimen of the Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub cleanser, Reveal Brightening Peel Pads, and the Dual Overnight Moisturizer. I also love how the Daytime moisturizer feels. It's luxurious but absorbs quickly, and I feel covered knowing it has 30 SPF. Will definitely be keeping up with this new routine- I see and feel a difference! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am pretty picky about my nighttime skincare routine. I was a bit worried about trying this product but I am soooo glad that I did. It does not leave me with a weird feeling the next morning, like I need to wash my face and get it off. A little goes a LONG way so the product will last, which is a big deal to me. I have also noticed the small wrinkles i have around my eyes are starting to soften. Bonus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am huge on facial moisturizer because i know how important it is to keep hydrated skin. I was a little scared putting my oils down in exchange for this overnight but let me tell you it is doing a great job at keeping my skin hydrated through the night even with the rubbing of my pillow on my face at night. I still wake up feeling soft and supple! I cant wait to see the brightening effects as i can already see an overall evenest to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used the Overnight Moisturizer. It has a sticky feeling all night. It does not seem to soak into the skin. I do have to stay that my face does feel smooth to the touch. Other than that I have not noticed a difference in the appearance of my dark spots or skin tone. I have only used this product for a week though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Love love love this nighttime moisturizer. When the combination of vitamin C and moisturizer combine it glides on your skin which sinks in very quickly without feeling oily. The bottle is 1 oz but you only need one pump for your face and there is enough left over which I use on my neck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used the moisturizer 5 nights in a row now and have seen a big difference in my skin. It absorbs well in the skin and does not feel greasy at all. My face feels smooth and soft. I asked my daughter if she noticed any difference with my skin tone and very quickly responded, ""Your face looks brighter!"" I was surprised the product line had made such a noticeable difference in such a short amount of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this moisturizer. My face immediatley fells soft and moisturized. It absorbs well into the skin. Does not leave face feeling oily. The packaging is easy to use.

"This dual serum moisturises and brightens in the first application and over time had made a big difference in my skin tone.

L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Dual Overnight Moisturizer makes my skin feel baby soft and does not feel sticky at all.

"At first I was doubtful and thinking that L'oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal is like many other beauty products that promise better looking skin. Apparently I was wrong to think that way as this entire series of products do work, and in less than 30 days. In just one week the results are real and visible! I highly recommend this product to all women out there who are trying to find something against light wrinkles and sun spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I Love Love Love these moisturizers!I have been using the day and night bright reveal brightening moisturizer for 10 days.I have seen some fine lines disappear and my skin looks radiant!Several people have also noticed a difference in my skin!I would definitely recommend these products to anyone looking to get rid of fine wrinkles.

"I love this product! After using the cleanser and the peel pads, you use the night moisturizer, its two products that come out together. When you put them on your skin it instantly feels smooth and soft. I've been using the product for just over a week. My skin definitely feels a lot smoother. I was concerned about sensitivity due to some of the ingredients but that hasn't happened. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"The packaging grabs your attention and Loreal Paris has always had a good reputation. However, after a week of using this product, my face began to break out with several pimples on my skin. I would wake up, look in the mirror, and get upset. The moisturizer feels great, but it was too much for my sensitive, oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This overnight moisturizer feels a bit heavy and greasy, but that doesn't really bother me since I just wear it to bed. My skin tone in the morning is soft and dewy, and looks more even.

"I received Bright Reveal by Loreal Dual Overnight Moisturizer. The entire line is amazing. I have combination skin and am over 40. I have some crepey skin in the neck area that I hate! After a few days this moisturizer made my neck and face softer, glowing, and noticeably less crepey skin in the neck area. I love it! Also note that my skin wasn't greasy which is always a plus. I received this product free for my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this for a week now. The first thing I noticed was how silky smooth it was. It made my skin super soft. I haven't ever used anything that made my sink that soft before.

"I'm only on day 3 of the L'Oréal Revitalift skin care and I absolutely love it! I've already been telling friends about how smooth my face feels and it really does look brighter.

"This product is truly what it says. It has a two products in one pump container. One is a light cream and the other is a light gel. When the pump is pushed, an equal amount of each is released. I only need one pump for each use. I use this product before I go to bed at night. It feels almost like a facelift. I can already tell a difference in my skin tone and I have only used it a few times thus far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"2 creams! I love to see the two creams come out separate and then mix in my hand! This cream is certainly soothing after the Revitalift scrub and pads. The Overnight Moisturizer does exactly what it says, makes my face soft over night! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the overnight moisturizer. It is absolutely east to use and my skin feels great! I can't wait to see how it feels after the full 30 days!

I think this new Revitalift is fabulous! Im in my first week of using it and the wrinkles on my forehead are barely visable. Ive used tons of products for my face over the years but nothing that has done exactly what it says its supposed to do. I love the fact that they have a moisturizer to use during the day and a different one for night time moisturizing is my favorite. I cant wait to see my results after more time of using it. Im in Love with Revitalift! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have been using the Dual Overnight Moisturizer now for a week and I must say it feels a little bit heavy and even sticky. I do have combination skin and it seems to bring out the oiliness of my skin. I am still waiting to see if it lightens the brown spots on my face and decreases the lines in my face. I'll report back at a later time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"After using the peel pads, I follow-up with the dual moisturizer. My under eye area feels much less dry. Overall, my face feels smoother having used all of the Revitalift products (cleanser, moisturizers and peel pads). The products are not too drying, nor too oily. They are perfect for combination and sensitive skin because I have both. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love love love this stuff. My face is soooo very smooth from the time I put it on till the time I wake up and start my morning routine. Loreal revitalize bright reveal overnight moisturizer is the BOMB. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm not a regular L'Oreal product user. But I may change after trying these samples. The scent is really appealing. Plus the moisturizer feels really light after application. I've only used the product for a couple days so I haven't noticed any change in pigment color. But from what I've used so far I'm very pleased with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have to admit, I'm already hooked. The L'oreal bright reveal is silky and decadent feeling overnight moisturizer. Unlike other moisturizers there is no greasy feeling afterwards, and my skin feels very pampered. I am truly impressed that a drug store cream feels and delivers moisture like a high end department store cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Wow this moisturizer! You only need a little bit. This is the most moisturizing thing ever! After using it my face felt so hydrated. I have never used anything that made my face feel this hydrated. I didn't use a whole pump though. I used less and it was more than enough! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was in the market for a new night cream so I was excited to try this. L'Oreal did not disappoint! I have been using this every night before bed for about 30 days now and I have to say, I'm very impressed! I feel like my fine lines are less noticeable, my skin is softer and I have an overall 'glow'. I will definitely continue using this product and highly recommend it to friends and family!

I like that the product dispenses a serum AND a moisturizer at the same time. This helps speed up my nighttime routine and clear space on the vanity. The two products blended together nicely when applied and quickly absorbed into my skin. There wasn't a sticky or heavy feeling; just moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i am really enjoying the new overnight moisturizer. It leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. I feel like my skin looks brighter and it is definitely less dry than before!

"I can't believe I waited until I was 42 to start moisturize on a nightly basis. If I knew the results would be so drastic I would have started a long time ago. My skin is so smooth, I look younger, my fine lines are diminishing. This is very gentle, no redness or tingling. My skin is not dry. It smells great. I look forward to my new nightly routine.

The L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Dual Overnight Moisturizer is one of the best products I've ever used. It applies very lightly but your skin immediately feels it working. Skin is smooth and bright in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the Revitalift Bright Reveal brightening dual over night moisturizer! I love how it helps to moisturize my skin without leaving it oily and greasy feeling. A tiny amount goes a long way so the bottle will last a couple of months as well! I am already noticing how much lighter my skin is looking and more toned!

"This overnight moisturizer is not heavy and light but powerful overnight lotion that smooth your skin out. I think this helps with elasticity of skin and also brightens it. I am in 30 days challenge right now and committed to use it full 30 days. from October 10 2016 through November 10th, I will be using this to see if this helps to get rid of wrinkles and sun spots. so far, it makes my skin feel softer. wish me luck! love the scent.

My skin has always had issued and I have to say that the revita lift made facial skin feel and look. As I am starting to age the dark circles around my eyes and crows feet are getting bad. After just a week of revita lift I saw changes I looked younger and healthier just having healthy skin. I would suggest it to anyone who is looking to feel better about there soon.

"I am really enjoying the night moisturizer - first I love that it includes 2 different kinds of lotion to give your skin everything it needs, but also a little goes a long way. It doesn't feel sticky, but rather moisturizing! I am really enjoying this night lotion, though I am giving it only 4 stars because since it has a peeling agent in it, I don't want to use it on my eye lids, so I have to use eye cream instead.

revitalift overnight moisturizer is awesome and it works great ! I was using another brighten system when I started this system and this is only day 3 and I have noticed a big difference already and I have bzzagent to hank ! I got to try all 4 products for free and I love them all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the overnight moisturizer, but it was a little heavy and too moisturizing for my oily skin. I still used it, but sometimes I would skip a night due to it just being a little too much for my skin. I think this would be more suitable for drier skin, but skipping nights still worked well for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the fact that the daily moisturizer has an SPF of 30 in it considering a lot of them only have 15-20. It worked great on days I didn't wear makeup, which was most, but I having oily skin I still had spots that got a little more oily. On days I wore makeup, I had to use my normal moisturizer for oily skin, as this made my face too oily with my primer and makeup on top of it. Other than that, I loved it! I definitely recommend everyone to try it out!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall I liked this overnight moisturizer since it did seem to help my skin. Over the time I was using it, it slowly helped my skin look smoother and it also diminished some of the beginnings of fine lines (aka wrinkles) that are on my face in places. It worked great and I'd consider purchasing this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love the Loreal Bright Reveal dual overnight moisturizer. I use it after the brightening peel pads. It feels so silky and smooth when you put it on your face. It makes my skin so sof.

"When I here anti-aging I am in. I was excited to try the dual moisturizer in one easy to handle pump. This product contains Glycolic Acid, pro retinols and vitamin C and I use it overnight before bed. My skin feel soft and I know it is rejuvenating while I sleep. These products are a good way to start a daily skin program. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After a month of using Loreal Revitalift's Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer my skin tone is visibly brighter and more even. I love the results it has given me. And I love the glow it brings to my skin. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy feeling, and it doesn't clog my pores. The scent is subtle, which is nice. After I apply this at night, I can go to sleep knowing it's at work hydrating and moisturizing my skin. My skin feels so smooth and silky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Thanks to Bzzagent I got to try L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer for FREE!!!!!! If you have oily skin I do not recommend this product. I do have breakouts occasionally and after a week of using this I started to break out near my nose and on my chin. Unfortunately due to this reaso I did not continue to use it so I can not speak of the results I may have seen. The smell is really good and my skin did not feel oily when using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. My skin was smoother and brighter. It eliminated any black heads and made my face feel so clean and fresh. I highly recommend it if you have dry skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
What I liked most about this moisturizer is that it is 2 in 1. I like that you don't have that 2 step process for night time moisturizing. Along with the scrub and the peel pads I really liked this product. My skin seems more evenly toned. I will continue to use this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really wanted to love this moisturizer. I loved the cleanser and cleansing pads in this collection, so I thought I had found my new skin care system. Unfortunately, the moisturizer burned my eyes. I did not apply it around my eye area, but within minutes of putting the moisturizer on, my eyes began watering. I tried for several nights. My skin would be so very soft, but my eyes just kept getting more irritated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried this product sporadically before going to bed. Sometimes it feels great on my skin and other times (like last night) it feels like it tingles/burns and then I get reddish splotches like my skin is getting irritated. This reaction does not happen all the time so I am unsure of whether to keep trying this product or not. I have dry, sensitive skin. I do not know if this product is for me.

"It seems like my skin drinks moisturizer in the summer and winter, but this moisturizer stays with you all night long! I love the supple softness the Dual Overnight Moisturizer helps to create no matter how hard your skin works through the day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this new L'Oreal Revitalift Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer! It's light weight, non greasy doesn't feel like an oil slick on your face. It's super easy to use, one pump of the dual nozzle is enough to cover your entire face. Really love the convenience of the dual action lotion, no fuss, no muss, no extra bottles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a great product! It is smooth and creamy, not oily. It goes on nicely and absorbs right away. It doesn't leave my skin with an oily or shiny finish. It has nice aroma. A little goes a long way!!! I really like this product! #gotitfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer was not what I expected. It was very lightweight, and not creamy like my usual overnight moisturizer. It felt very sticky on my skin. It also seemed to have ""brightening"" glitter in it, which seems very counter-intuitive to me. I want to feel clean and smooth while I sleep, not sticky and sparkly. I wish I was happier with this product, but I can't recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer continues to outshine itself. My skin has never been more radiant... more soft. In 30 days, using this entire routine, my face has completely changed. Not bad for 50.. not bad at all!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this moisturizer but it was a little heavy for my skin. I tend not to need the full amount so I try not to pump a full amount. Or if i do it can cover my neck and then some. It has duel chambers which I have no idea if it's beneficial to be that way but somehow, it's a bit more fun. I do end up with soft skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked this, but it took a while to get used to the pump in order to get both sides out evenly. One thing that I would like is if this could somehow mix before it comes out, because I don't feel like I always mix it completely. The smell is pleasant and not too strong. Out of this whole line, I will definitely continue to use this. Not sure how much brighter my skin is, but I feel like it is working slowly, and it does a good job moisturizing without making my skin feel sticky.

"I started using the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Dual Overnight Moisturizer as part of the 30 day challenge almost a month ago. It started working almost overnight, I started noticing small sunspots disapearing and eventually fading. It feels refreshing on your skin, helping you prepare for a restorative night's rest. I plan on using the L'Oreal Revitalift skincare line as part of my daily regimine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free BzzAgent and completely love it. In combination with additional L'Oreal Bright Reveal products, my skin has never felt or looked so good. I have sensitive skin and this product did not cause any skin issues and has worked wonders on my skin tone. I will definitely be purchasing this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is for night only as it has products that will cause sensitivity to the sun. Having said that its a great night time moisturizer. It has a 2 in 1 pump to hydrate and illuminate. It has a light clean scent. I have an oily t-zone and dry skin around my face and found that some mornings my skin was oilier than it should be when using this product. However, my skin was plump and bright. I used this in conjunction with the set of L'Oreal Revitalift Brightening products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"My normal skin tends to get a bit dry if I don't moisturize properly every night. I've tried many moisturizers and some are just a bit too harsh for my skin. This one didn't hurt my skin and it lightly moisturized while I slept. When I woke up my skin still felt soft and not the least bit greasy. Paired with the other products in the line, it makes my skin glow! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have been using the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer for about 5 weeks now. This stuff is awesome! I have been using it on my face, neck, and upper chest every night, and my skin is more even, smooth, and soft than it's been in years! I love that it combines Glycolic acid and Pro-Retinol to attack the wrinkles and aging skin. I will definitely be buying this for years to come! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this for more than 30 days now and I am loving the results. I have never been able to use anything on my face like these products. Usually when I am using more than one product on my face through out the day this is when I get more break outs and black heads and makes my skin so dry. I haven't used soap on my face in over 30 years because of this kind of result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This Overnight Moisturizer feels so light on your skin compared to many night time moisturizers. I was leary of the packaging because it dispenses two different formulas out of the container. Had absolutely no problem with dispensing equal amounts of product. Definitely would buy for the price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This product really made my skin so much younger looking! I have very oiley skin and this has not made me break out in anyway or made me oiler. It has a nice light orange scent to it.

You need very little product for the face and neck and it absorbs very quickly into the skin. It is moisturizing, it did cause any irritation to the skin or breakouts. My skin feels looks and feels smoother every morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Thank you L'Oréal. I was very lucky to be chosen to try the whole L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Collection. It seems to be lighter.

"I attempted to use this every night after removing my make up and using the Revitalift scrub. I could sure tell the next morning if I didn't use it. My skin felt rough and not at all bright and beautiful. The hardest part for me was making this a routine. I always just wiped off the make up with a wipe, brushed my teeth and went to bed. This takes a little time and discipline, but it the results are great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

The L'Oreal brightening Dual overnight moisturizer really worked for me. My skin felt smooth and not too greasy. I preferred it over the day moisturizer that made my skin feel somewhat greasy under my daily makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this dual night treatment every night for a week. I love that waking up the next day I don't have any oily spots. The texture of the product is light and easy to apply, it soaks in quickly and doesn't leave a shine or residue. After 7 days of use I felt like I was waking up with more hydrated, smoother skin. I love that the pump bottle gets rid of the need to stick your fingers into a jar, and that one pump is the perfect amount for a single use. I received this product free for testing purposes from Influenster."
"I have been using these products for about 2 weeks now and I am pleasantly surprised! My skin does look brighter and smoother. The ruddiness is gone too. I have sensitive skin yet the products don't bother me. It is so smooth when applying it, feels like silk going on your skin. The smell is very light and pleasant. This is a must have!

I think the Dual overnight moisturizer is a highly effected product. The thinness and shearness of the product make it go on the skin so smooth and light. There is no heavy moisturizer feeling with this product so that the skin can actually breathe while you are sleeping. I feel that the product does brighten the skin overnight.

"I had to work both of my jobs last night. I was on my feet all day and came home super exhausted. First thing I did when I came home was to wash my face with L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser, followed by Brightening Peel Pads and finished with Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer. While my body was still exhausted my face felt amazing!! Good way to end a long day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I fell in love with this product the first night after using this product. The product is so easy to use. You just need a little of the product to go a long way.

"I love the L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer. It feels so soft and silky going on, and moisturizes throughout the night. I still feel the silky product when I wake up in the morning and wash my face in the shower. I feel this product protects and nourishes my skin throughout the night and helps to diminish fine lines and wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the overnight moisturizer for it does put moisture back into my face but it does give a greasy feeling that I don't like, maybe if it had a more soaked up feeling than that greasy feeling. I also do like the softness that it gives through out the night into the day. I don't wake up with that dry feeling like with some of the other moisturizers that I have tried. So that is a plus. My skin does look brighter and smoother I do have to give it that. Overall I like it and will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Lightweight, pleasant smell. Results obvious after a few days! I will admit, I had a hard time remembering to use this at night, but once I kept with it I found it a breeze to remember. Works well with the other products in this line. Can't wait to see how my skin will look by the end of the 30 days! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the cleanser, daily moisturizer, peel pads, and overnight moisturizer for about 2 weeks. This skin care routine has been amazing! My skin is brighter and softer than it has been in years. Even the sun and heat of summer has not dulled the results of these products. I am especially fond of the overnight moisturizer - my skin is amazingly soft and bright when I wake up in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've absolutely loving the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer! I actually noticed a change the very next morning. My skin seemed brighter immediately.

I wish I had taken a 'before' picture to compare now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This doesn't leave the skin very oily, leaving it to look bright and fresh the next day. It is one of the best products that I have used. It is easy to apply and only takes a dab.

"if you have days where you have to wake up and still feel tired, I would recommend using Loreal Revitallift Bright Reveal day moisturizer. It really does brighten your skin and make you look more awake And it doesn't make your skin greasy. I highly recommend it. I am on the road traveling for work most of the time. So anything that helps me look more alive/awake and not so tired is great! Thank you Loreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have trouble sleeping through the night and end up with dark circles, so I tried the Dual Overnight moisturizer cream when I went to bed and my skin was still smooth in the morning. I was skeptical at first to see the overnight longevity of the product but it was still smooth and my dark circles were not as dominant in the am. It may be because of the vitamin C in the product or the Glycolic. Either way I'm enjoying the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've trusted my eyelashes to L'Oreal for 20+ years now, so I was thrilled to be included in this trial. Their spokesmodel J Lo says that it starts working within the first week & IT DOES!

This will be my new routine, thanks Bzz! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I am really enjoying this product. I find that it is so Easy to use, on-greasy and it is even evening out my skin. Tone. Thus far The L'oreal products that I've used have done what they said they would do. For the past week or so, My lines on my face appear reduced and my bags around my eyes seem smaller.

I could go on and on about the way my skin feels but try it First and I promise you won't regret it.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the Overnight Moisturizer is OK. It feels greasy and I know it is probably wiping off on my pillows at night. I do use it very sparingly. I think it is a nice concept with the dual. I put it on after using the scrub and the peel pads. It does make the peel pads less tacky feeling after using. I do wish it had a better scent as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturer is wonderful! The design of the bottle is very cool! In one pump you get lotion and serum! It saves me a step which is awesome! The cream is very moisturizing and has been doing a great job with my older skin...late fourties. I also notice a softer feel to my skin! Give it a try!

"This is a great nighttime moisturizer! I'm really picky about my moisturizers. This has a very light, fresh citrus scent. It only takes a small amount and is not greasy or heavy feeling.

"I have spent loads of money at department stores buying those really small, really expensive products. I have never tried any facial products from Loreal. I had my doubts that it would actually make a difference but I was pleasantly surprised after using products after four days (I used as directed day and night first cleanser, pads and day/night cream) I could tell my skin was clean, refreshed and felt all together younger. Can't wait to see what next week looks like. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have been using the moisturizer for a week and I was super excited about it. I thought it did a great job on keeping my skin looking fresh and moistured but sadly the pump on the dispenser stopped working today. I'm totally bummed as I loved the product and packaging.

It does feel a little sticky/tacky when I first apply it, but it absorbs nicely. When I wake up my skin is so soft and almost has a glow. For someone who has very fair skin, any glow is a bonus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for about a week. I have always had issues with larger pores and flaky skin. With this product I have seen my pores are a bit smaller. My skin hasn't been flaky at all. Can wait to see the results after my 30 day challenge [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I would like to know if this is legit (does it really work on wrinkles, etc). I have tried it & like the way it feels on my skin, it is not too sticky & a little goes a long way. I usually pump 2 small squirts on my hand for my neck & face concentrating on my 11's (between eyebrows & lip area (straw - I do not smoke). I would buy this product later.

"I didn't use an overnight moisturizer until I received this product. I have to say that I really like it. I like that a little goes a long way. I can moisturize my whole face and neck with less than one pump. I like how it compliments the brightening peel pads and that it's not really oily. I also like that it's not heavy, so I don't feel like I've got something on my face when I'm going to bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"The moisturizer came in a cool dual-action pump, combining two effective anti-aging treatments in one pump. It seems like an effective formula with the scientifically proven exfoliating concentrate of Glycolic Acid, Vitamin C and Pro-Retinol... wait that's 3 treatments! Somehow they got the other one in there too. My skin seems softer. My boyfriend tried it too, and he liked it. It seemed to get rid of his flaky skin. It also smelled pretty good.

"L'Oreal Paris Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Moisturizer is our first dual-action, dermatologist-inspired brightening plus anti-wrinkle night treatment, combining two effective anti-aging treatments in one pump. This safe, yet effective formula with an exfoliating concentrate of Glycolic Acid and the infusion of Vitamin C and Pro-Retinol targets the appearance of wrinkles and uneven tone to reveal brighter, more radiant skin in just 1 week.

I am using these items together as part of BzzAgent and just love the whole set. I really like the overnight moisturizer as the serum seems really concentrated and it only takes a small pump to have enough for the whole face and neck. I can't wait to see the final reveal after the entire month of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin is already looking radiant and beautiful! Would definitnetly recommond these products! Easy to use and doesn't dry out your skin. Seems to be making my fine lines disappear.

"I did not like this product. It was a gel form and felt very sticky whenever I applied on my skin. I like a creamy moisturizer. My skin did feel soft after application, but I couldn't get over the gel form and would not purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used this product for 3 days and I already see an improvement in my skin tone. My dark spots are quickly fading. I'm very happy with the results so far. My skin feels smooth and the fine lines are smoothing out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I used this in conjunction with the other Bright Reveal products and the overall regimen was wonderful. After the 30 day challenge I would be interested in using this product line. It was super easy to use, gave my skin a very fresh feeling and made it look more glowy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This is my favorite product in the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection. My skin feels softer almost immediately when I put it on & the light citrus scent is wonderful. I have rosacea & this product did not irritate my skin; it seems to help lessen some of my redness. I could not believe it but one small pump covers your entire face!

"As far as a nighttime moisturizer goes, this was decent. I found it to be pretty sticky for my liking though. I really like to go to bed with my face feeling clean and dry, but this left my skin feeling moist and sticky. It did give me nice results in the morning, but I really couldn't get past the sticky, moist feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is the perfect companion to the daily cleansing scrub. It sooths and moisturizes and I need not feel greasy when I woke up the next morning. In a previous review I mentioned that I used the cleansing scrub every other day, this is the same for the moisturizer. I used them as companion products.

I liked this product. Overall it was quite moisturizing and made my face feel nice and soft in the mornings. I loved the feel and texture and was happy that for a nightime cream that it wasn't overly heavy. The only drawback I had was the microglitter this product seemed to contain. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this is the best product of the lot. I love the way it makes my face feel before I go to bed and when I wake up. The only problem I had was it did not tell what order to use them in. I had to call the company because they all just say use in conjunction with. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used the Revitalift brightening dual overnight moisturizer for thirty days. This moisturizer is light, absorbed into my face quickly, didn't leave a greasy feel, and it didn't cause me to break out. I really love this stuff and plan to continue using this moisturizer in my nightly routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I'm still using this product even tho my 30 day challenge ended over a week ago. I love the way it makes my skin feel fresh and clean before I go to bed each night. It's not greasy or sticky at all and really makes my skin feel softer by morning. The fresh citrus scent is very light and pleasant. I've also noticed that the fine lines in my face have diminished since I started using it. I plan on using this Overnight Moisturizer for a long time.

I love how smooth my face is as well as how the product smells. I even bought the other products to use as the filler for fine lines. I love how the cleanser makes my face feel so clean and bright. It feels wonderful after the pads as well as the moisturizer. I spend a lot of time outdoors and the moisturizer really prevents my face from getting burnt.

"I enjoyed this lotion before bed it was thick so you don't need to use a lot. I did find that my face was seriously oily when I work up and my face felt gross, from the oil. I do have oily skin but its not that oily when I use my regular moisturizer, which is usually organic coconut oil. So if you have dry skin this might be just what you need!

I started this product and loved how this moisturizer felt as far as not oily. to be honest this whole facial kits worked as far as tightness and cleanse but I did not see any difference as far as brightness goes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I LOVE the Revitalift Bright Reveal line of face care products from L'Oréal Paris, and my favorite product in the line is the overnight moisturizer is my favorite product in the line and my favorite overnight moisturizer I have ever tried.

"After using the face wash which I love. I applied the night time moisturizer. I like the smell but don't like how thick and greasy it feels on my skin, it's smells nice and the morning it leaves my skin soft but I honestly don't see any visually results besides the soft feeling on the surface . This is a product I will not re purchase . But thanks for letting me try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this moisturizer very much. It comes in a dual bottle that dispenses a white cream from one side while dispensing a clear gel from the other side. It goes on the skin easily and has a nice smell. Easily absorbed. I gave it 4 stars because I broke out during the first week of using it until my skin adjusted. But maybe it was due to hormonal factors and not the moisturizer. All in all would recommend to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I saw a different in just one use This daily pad gently resurface dull, uneven tone and rough texture to reveal fresh-looking, smoother skin while visibly reducing wrinkles over time.

"For me, the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer worked great! It not only felt silky going on my skin but when it dried a little it didn't have the same sticky feeling that the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Moisturizer had. And when I woke up in the morning, my skin felt very moisturized and some of my dry spots were gone. I would recommend this moisturizer for anyone needing a good overnight dose of moisture!

I loved the L'Oreal Revitalift Dual Overnight Moisturizer!!!! The first time I used it I did a full pump which ended up to be too much and left my face feeling really greasy. The next night I used only a half of a pump and it was perfect!!!! I love how it brightened my skin and smoothed away my fine lines. I will absolutely be buying this product in the future.

"The Overnight moisturizer is light, but with a slight greasy feel. It takes longer to dry than the daily moisturizer. The results are fantastic. My skin is brighter and the lines around my eyes are reduced after 30 days of usage. I love the line and will continue to use the cleanser, and both moisturizers. The cost of the moisturizer is warranted due the ingredients and results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"The Loreal RevitaLift Bright Reveal Dual Overnight moisturizer product wasn't my favorite of the whole line. At first I was excited at the neatness of the dispenser, with two separate tubes that mix together when you pump the formula out. But I felt the ratio of gel to lotion was too high and I often went to bed feeling sticky instead of moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is my fave of the new revitalize line. It feels so nice to put on after a shower and has a very luxurious quality to it. So light and non greasy, and I like how it has the double chamber and mixed together when you put some in your hand. My skin feels nice in the morning and I feel like I am using less moisturizes in the morning because of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It feels a bit slippery/slimy going on and takes a moment to dry but it makes my skin feel so soft and smooth afterwards. Especially in the morning. I wake up every morning looking like I just had a facial. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think that this moisturizer did not moisturize my skin at all. It burned off my skin and made my face red. I could feel the heat come off my skin when I put it on my face. I had extremely dry, damaged skin after using it. It peeled off and looked awful. I had to use 100% natural lavender oil on my skin to rebuild it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the dual overnight moisturizer is probably my fave. My skin feels super smooth and hydrated in the morning. It looks refreshed and bright. The best part of this moisturizer?

It absorbs completely and leaves my skin feeling soft. After using it for 2 weeks I have noticed and difference in my fine lines, wrinkles and dark spots. This moisturizer doesn't seem to have a bad effect on my sensitive skin. I am pleased with the results so far and will continue to use the entire product line.

I've been using this product every night since the package arrived. So far I am very impressed. The formula is not too heavy and not too light. The fragrance is also not too strong.

"I am in absolute awe of what a great product Loreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer is. I have used moisturizer now for several years but still struggled with uneven skin tone and a few fine lines that go with life. After using just one week, my skin tone is even so much so I no longer even use foundation and my face looks like I did in high school. My daughter has been mistaken for my sister. I will purchasing for sure. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used several of the overnight moisturizers and this has been my favorite. Often there is a greasy feel or strong perfumed scent. Not so with L'Oreal Revitalift. The overnight moisturizer is light weight, not greasy, and has a mild scent. I have very sensitive skin and no reaction to this moisturizer. My skin feels soft and refreshed in the morning and there is no caked on lotion feel I have to wash off before applying my make up. I will definitely continue using this product.

"I wake up in the morning and my skin feels smooth and supple, not dry and brittle the way it used to. Its nice to wake up and not want to rush to wash my face because it feels like its going to crack because of the dry air from the air conditioner, the moisturizer and serum combine and create an barrier to protect my skin. I defiantly recommend this product to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so surprised that this product didn't irritate my skin at all. In fact, I've been using it since receiving it and I have noticed that my skin feels and looks slightly better than when I started. The lotion itself feels like silk going on, and sinks in fast. I was previously using a ""natural"" face lotion for dry skin, and was worried that the anti-aging ingredients in this would be -too much- for my sensitive skin, but I haven't had any ill effects at all.

"I have been using the product for over a month and I love it. It is two products in one. You pump it once and you get a cream base and a light oil, rub the two together and put on your face and it feels like silk. I wake up the next morning and may face feels so soft, silky and smooth. It has a slight citrus smell but the effects are truly amazing. I will continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for several weeks now and unfortunately had to discontinue using it due to a bad reaction. This product made my fact too red and I broke out in painful acne.

I finally was able to try the overnight moisturizer and was impressed with the results.

"This moisturizer leaves my skin smoothe and soft. I'm using the entire product line for free, thanks to L'Oreal Paris and BzzAgent, and have definitely noticed some tightening and brightening, though not without some mild skin irritation and drying.

I did not care for the dual overnight moisturizer that is part of the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal system. I gave it a fair chance by using it for 3 weeks but had to discontinue use because it was causing breakouts. I have very acne prone skin and this moisturizer was just too heavy. It probably would work really well for someone who is prone to drier skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the Dual overnight moisturizer for 3 weeks now. Not sure which ingredient it is, but it leaves my face kind of sticky. It sticks to my pillowcase and is warm. It feels refreshing, you can feel it working because there's a slight tingle. Other than that, I do like the results of it reducing wrinkles and sun spots.

The fact that you only have to use a small amount is also nice. I will definitely keep using this product after the challenge is over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer goes on smooth and has a light citrus fragrance.

So I'm 2 weeks in and my skin feels smoother. Of course I didn't expect it to turn the clock back 5 or 10 years on this 48 year old face. But my face feels clean and I like the moisturizer. There's no burning and I have pretty sensitive skin. So I'll post a final pic at the end of 30 days & you can be the judge. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Okay, first of all, I was a little skeptical. I'm not sure I liked the way the ingredients pumped out separately. But hey, this stuff works! I used it nightly on my face but also on my neck. I can still feel the moisture when I get up in the morning! That's really what an overnight serum should do... Last overnight!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think everyone needs to buy this it does wonders my skin is so much more brighter/softer looking/feeling and it only took 4 weeks I'm so glad I tried this I don't know now if I can live w/o it I'm hooked [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Duel Overnight Moisturizer I tried through BzzAgent. I like the duel ingredients being combined when you dispense it to keep it at it's most effective. It really brightens and does not irritate my skin, which can be sensitive. It is light and easily absorbed into the skin so it is not greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like using this at night. It helps make my face nice and soft. I love the smell of the product. I will defently be using all of the time. I would recommend everyone to use it. I received this product for free from L'Oreal Paris for reviewing and testing purposes only. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The overnight moisturizer is great. It's two products in one! Part serum, part moisturizer mix together to make a light but very moisturizing product. Not greasy or heavy as many other overnight products are. It didn't stain or bleach my sheets and I woke up with soft, fresh skin every morning. The only negative I could see is come wintertime when my skin is more dry I might need to add an additional heavier moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"i got this Lorea'l Revitalift bright reveal brightening for free through bzzagent and let me tell you I love it.

I use this moisturizer everyday after I clean my face with the pads and before I go to bed. The moisturizer is light and soaks in quickly. Its not sticky. It's a great part of this collection!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product goes on feeling very silky! Just one press of the pump delivers enough for my whole face and a bit for the front of my neck. I have been using for about 2 weeks and see such a difference. The wrinkles between my eyes are barely visible now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I had the opportunity to use L'Oréal Revitalift Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer when L'Oréal Paris gave me the product to try for free. The dual dispenser is beautiful, but it was difficult to get both products out evenly -- the product would come out of one side but not the other. I also didn't care for the way it felt thick and heavy on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Dual Overnight Moisturizer is a combination of glycolic acid and Vitamin C. My skin is sensitive, and I usually avoid this type of product, but I really like the Revitalift line, so I thought I would try it. After two nights of using the product I could see a noticeable difference in my skin. My skin lookS brighter, and appeared tighter. I try to use it every other night, because for me every night is too much. A nice product and it works well [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the L'Oreal Revitalift Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer is great. It makes my skin feel so soft. I'm starting to see some of the wrinkles look better. Only problem is my fiance hates the smell of the moisturizer. It does have a strange smell. I definitely will keep using it though! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product daily and am amazed at the transformation. My skin has not been this soft and supple in years. The other day my sister told me that I look younger and I agreed. I showed her the Revitalift products I have been using and she said ""well keep doing what you're doing."" She plans to purchase the products on her own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this moisturizer is the bomb! It has very little smell, and when put on a clean face, it feels so refreshing and you can tell how well your skin absorbs this product. My face is very much brighter since using this moisturizer and I like it very much! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thanks to Loreal Paris I was able to try Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer for free. I really like it. After using it for a few weeks now, I feel like my skin tone is more even and brighter. I was starting to get a few fine lines around my eyes, but holy smokes they're gone! This stuff is a keeper in my book! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This overnight moisturizer is very good to my skin. I have noticed visible results of fine lines fading. Skin seems to look brighter and now has a glow. It doesn't have a harsh fragrance or anything like that. It it very easy to use as well. I received the product for free from L'Oréal Paris, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is an absolute must have for radiant and glowing morning skin. Not greasy or sticky, the moisturizer works all night and you wake up with glowing soft skin. I have been very impressed with this entire line and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a daily skin care system. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Tried free thanks to # L'Oreal After only a week of using it, I'm seeing results like the product claims. What I love about this product is how smooth, healthy and bright my skin has become.Does wonders overnight.I would definitely recommend this product to a friends and family.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love the feel of the overnight moisturizer. It has a very light texture, non-greasy, and low fragranced which is good for sensitive skin. A little bit goes a long way, so one bottle should definitely last each client for up to thirty days. I've been using this product now for at least two weeks and I am very pleased with the way it moisturizes my skin while I sleep at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had, note the word HAD an uneven, dull skin tone, but after using the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer, my 43 year old skin is beginning to look like a teenagers again! This product has not broken out my sensitive skin, but has made it smooth and evened out my skin tone in only a week. I can't wait to see what my skin looks like in 30 days! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this stuff is awesome! I wish I had been using it all along. I can tell such a difference in my skin. I have tried lots of other products that either broke me out or made my oily skin feel more oily. As soon as this moisturizer touches your fingers, you know that it is different. Then, when it touches your face, your face will sigh with relief! I forgot it a couple of times and woke up cursing myself because my face looked all dry and old! I will not be forgetting very often.

I recently received a free sample of this product to try for review. I am quite happy that I did. I would have to say that this is my favorite product out of them all . I love using a nightly moisturizer and waking up with fresh smooth skin. This moisturizer is easy to apply makes my skin look and feel great and also makes my skin brighter. I am very happy with this product and would recommend it to others. #gotitfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer leaves my skin feeling so rejuvenated. It does not leave my skin feeling greasy or dry. All you need is just a tiny squirt and your face feels so smooth. I have gotten so many compliments asking what skin care line of I have been using. Some moisturizers I have used in the past have left my skin feeling greasy and dry. Not this one. It is the best I have ever used. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely loved the L'Oreal Ivernight Moisturizer! It provided me with smooth, soft, non-oily intense overnight moisturizing. I used the nighttime moisturizer every night after washing my face. My face felt and looked soft and smooth without becoming oily. I have combination skin so I'm always worried about moisturizers making my skin oily or clogging my pores. This moisturizer is awesome and one that I will continue to purchase! Thank you L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using a free sample of L'Oreal overnight moisturizer and really am happy with the results. My face had several dry spots and those have disappeared. It has a nice scent and goes on easily. It does seem to take a few minutes to absorb into skin, but not a problem. My face looks visibly shinier, smoother and well nourished. It only takes a small amount to cover my entire face. I will continue using this product after my free sample is gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although I enjoy the night moisturizer, I've found the night moisturizer to be bit sticky and it takes a bit of time to dry, but I figure that's just all of the goodness sinking in. I would recommend it, but you would need to keep that in mind. If you want something that drys quickly, this would not be for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First off, I received the product for free from L'Oréal Paris to try. Now, let me tell you, I loved it! I applied before bed, and when I woke I could FEEL a difference. My face felt...newer, fresher, reborn. I do not have sensitive skin but this may leave those who do a little uncomfortable. The feeling though, left me thinking it was working and felt great. Notice: YOU MUST USE SUNSCREEN WITH THIS PRODUCT! You are more susceptible to sunburn after using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this night moisturizer from L'Oreal Paris for a honest opinion. I can truly say that this is my now go to favorite night moisturizer. It smells great, is light, and non greasy. It leaves my face feeling unbelievably soft and young feeling. I am so happy I tried this. My skin hasn't been this amazing and fresh looking since I was in my twenties. I will definitely continue using this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I appreciated this moisturizer. I love that I don't need very much for good results. It leaves my skin feeling very smooth and hydrated with just a small pump. In the morning, it feels like I am washing off a facial mask, which tells me that it is effective. I will continue to keep this product in my skincare routine.

"Laying my head on my pillow after applying this dual overnight moisturizer was amazing. I couldn't fall asleep, all I wanted to do was caress my face and feel the softness it has become since using product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal set!! It's been only 2 weeks of using. At first couple of days application I already noticed brighten skin tone and tighten skin pores. It does great work! And also it doesn't stink or peels like any other company's products that I've been using. Even I like the smell, it's not strong it's pleasant and refreshing. I definitely recommend this product to all my friends and thank to the bzzagent and L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It is my favorite product of the whole set! At night you use the cleanser, followed by peel pads, and finally apply the overnight moisturizer! Two pumps is enough to cover face and neck and this leaves skin soft supple, REALLY working while you sleep! Revealing skin tone , clarity, and say goodbye to those fine lines !!!A must have :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received a free sample from L'Oréal Paris to give this wonderful product a try. It's silky smooth and I love the way my skin feels in the morning now. It has a wonderful light scent and is easily absorbed. I love this overnight moisturizer and you will too! I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great product, the packaging is really pretty and the actual product works great. I have been using it for about a week now and my skin always feels really great after using the moisturizer and the next morning. I really like that this is a two part product, moisturizer and serum, its very light weight but moisturizing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
What a difference this product makes. I have dry skin but this moisturizes so well that when I wake up in the morning my skin is still soft instead of dry again (as is the case with most products). I have also been told by coworkers that my skin is glowy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
What you need to know about this product before you try it is that it is lightweight on your skin. I have tried other overnight moisturizers before and I felt like they were so heavy on my skin not this product. I haven't been using it every night because I forgot a couple nights. It is easier for me to have a morning routine than an evening routine but this is a product I would buy again it may just last me a little longer than my morning products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am very happy with this line of skin care, especially the overnight moisturizer. I believe it has made such a difference in the appearance of my skin. I like to combination of moisturizer and serum. My skin feel soft and smooth after use. And I wake up feeling just the same as when I went to bed. Thank you to L'oreal for letting me try out this product for free! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love love love my l'oreal revitalift bright reveal overnight moisturizer. I have been using it for alittle over a week now can tell that my skin is softer and brighter.. love love love this product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the moisturizer. It makes my skin feel nice, soft and really hydrated. I have some difficulty getting equal amounts of the the moisturizers out together. I personally don't like having to mix the two together-not a huge deal, just not my preference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is pretty innovative. I like the idea of mixing the two substances to create a moisturizer. It actually has a slight shimmer to it which I don't really care for but I'm ok with it. It keeps my skin feeling full until the next morning. I'm really happy we were given full sized products too. I will definitely buy this again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wasn't a huge fan of this moisturizer. It was a bit too sticky for me. Even 1/2 hour after applying my skin still felt sticky and like it hadn't absorbed the product. I like that it is very lightly scented because I'm not a huge fan of overly scented products. I'm hoping the daytime moisturizer isn't as sticky feeling. I was quite disappointed with this and expected a little more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product free from L'Oreal Paris in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this product for about a week now consistently and I love the way it makes my skin feel. I never really used the overnight moisturizers in the past but I think I will continue. I love the way my face feels in the morning when I wake up. I still have that tight and fresh feeling.

"The free products I received from Loreal are amazing. I received 4 full size samples and they are amazing. The Dual Overnight Moisturizer isnt greasy, it easy to apply, and the scent isnt overwhelming. My skin felt awesome after using. This product line deserves so much more than 5 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Such a great end to this 3 part routine for the evening. Yes there are 4 pieces to this regime, but 3 pieces are meant for before bedtime, this being the last one. I love the combination of the 2 cremes and how smooth they are on your face. It doesn't leave your face feeling greasy or with buildup like most nightly moisturizers do...and it smells great too!"
Recd free to review! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Again, just as the other 3 pieces of this regimen, no greasy after feel, no buildup. This brightening moisturizer absorbs well into the skin and leaves you face feeling fabulous! I love that it has enough SPF in it to protect your face from future lines and wrinkles but doesn't have all that thick grease feeling of sunscreen that leaves you breaking out!

I did a little reading up on this product before receiving it just to get the feel of peoples reactions. I asked workers at department stores to see if they have heard about it.I have been using this every night and I have never in 20 years seen anything like this.I will be using this from now on.I feel so young looking.Fresh faced and renewed.

"This is a great moisturizer with SPF 30. It's lightly scented,no greasy and is perfect for my skin. It blends quickly and I haven't had any redness or irritation from the sun after using this collection. In nutshell, I will continue to use all the items, as I had great results with great glow.

At first I was scared that this moisturizer will irritate my skin because I have used so many products that only irritate and dry my skin and that are expensive.But L'0real products are different with this night moisturizer my skin feel refresh and smoother and I have only been using this product for five days and I feel great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Packaging seems cheap. My top will not stay on and it does not pump out from both sides, so I am not sure if I am getting the full benefit of the product or not."
"The product is okay, but seems expensive. I would not repurchase due to price and poor packaging. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was not my favorite of the 4 products to try for free from L'Oreal Paris. I noticed no difference in my skin. All 4 products used in a weeks time left me with acne at the crease of my nose, on my forehead and chin."
This product may work better for younger skin. I use a high end regime and it does much better than L'Oreal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin feels and looks fantastic! I get compliments everyday from strangers on how natural and soft my skin looks.

"I tried L'Oréal Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer. I already have a nightly moisturizer, so I was a little leery about trying something different. I liked the feel and smell of this product. A small amount of this went a long way to cover my face and neck. I definitely was interested in a product that brightens and tightens. I was not disappointed. Give it a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'oreal has created a product with sheer coverage , that leaves my skin feeling soft and supple. It only takes a small amount but produces major results.My skins looks youthful and vibrant according to my friends and the mirror. I received these products free for review from L'oreal Paris. No more tight , dull skin. This along with the other products create an awesome package. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is one of the best nighttime face lotions that I have ever used. I have tried several nighttime moisturizers and wrinkle creams. This is by far my favorite. I love that your skin feels totally moisturized after using the product without feeling greasy at all. My skin feels so soft and smooth after application of this product. This is a must try nighttime lotion. I love the way that my skin looks and feels after only several days of use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the L'Oreal Overnight Moisturizer is great. I've applied it 4 nights in a row and can see a difference in the clarity of my skin already. It's a thicker cream, but goes on very smooth. I can tell it coats the face nicely for overnight results. I would definitely add this to my night time routine to keep my skin looking fresh each morning.

"I have very oily skin and don't normally use moisturizer. I actually like this product. I can put it on at night time, and in the morning my face feels bright and revived.

I have been using this product for almot a week now and my skin is glowing. what I wanted to know before I got this product is would my wrinkles fade away and they did already..My skin looks healthy and younger I cannot wait to see my skin after 30 days [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't know how I feel about putting stuff on my face before bed. What does it do? Does it wear off on my pillow? I did not experience any difference in fine lines, but my skin looked even and bright in my one week trial. I did the whole routine very religiously. I liked that it was to bottles in one. It was a tad to much product in one pump, half a pump will do. It feels wonderful and smells even better. It quenched my skins thirst. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free from L'Oréal Paris to try out in exchange for my honest review, so here goes. I loved the collection as a whole but felt the overnight moisturizer made my skin oily adv hour after putting it on. I loved the way felt going on and a little goes a long way with this one but in the long run, it wasn't a winner for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer I received free from #BzzAgent and #L'Oreal.

"I've been using the L'Oreal Revitalift night time moisturizer and folks....the BEST overnight moisturizer I have EVER used and I have tried a bunch. My face feels so smooth, looks great and it is not greasy! My old moisturizer used to make me feel like my face was sticking to the pillow! And I honestly didn't see much of a benefit. You've got to try this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was quite happy with the overnight moisturizer. It was light, non-greasy and smelled nice. It was gentle and did not burn and sent me to bed feeling fresh and clean.

"This product is great so far. I tried it for three nights in a row. It makes my skin soft and tight in a good way, no allergies or skin reactions. The packaging looks very expensive. I prefer it to my usual Olay night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The third item in the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal collection is the dual over night mosturizer. I think this one comes in a really neat container. It has two chambers for each moisturizer. It comes in a pump so it is a lot easier to use, so you don't waste any. It works over night while you sleep. My face feels really clean and soft. I can't wait to see what my face looks and feels like in 30 days, because I am doing the 30 day challenge! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This has to be my favorite product so far. The dual pump with one side of gel and the other cream is pretty unique. The product dispenses easily and a little goes a long way. Going on day 3 and I must say my skin feels silky smooth after applying this moisturizer. This is not heavy at all so I do not feel like I am going to bed with a mask on. The scent is wonderful and not overbearing. I will definitely be keeping this as part of my night time routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It was thick, and caused me to break out. I have oily acne-prone skin, and felt a bit iffy about trying this product. It smells nice, but caused me to break out. Otherwise, I would continue to use it. Made my face a bit smoother and plump, which is great. I will probably stick to using this on my neck, elbows, and knees.

REVITALIFT BRIGHT REVEAL SPF is a light but moisturizing SPF. I have sensitive skin and this product does not irritate my skin at all. The moisture is just right feels light like your not wearing anything. Skin looks nice and even toned. after using for 3 weeks less lines and more radiant. Goodbye dullness and hello youthful. This product was a free trail and I can say I have already gone to store and purchased more SPF. I love the entire Revitalift line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I think this moisturizer is the best way to say goodnight to your skin and say good morning to a bright beautiful face. This powerful moisturizer has the ability to exfoliate with glycol in acid and then infuse your skin with vitamin c and pro retinal ingredients that take care of dark circles, wrinkles, and uneven skin tone!

I am very happy with how well this overnight cream has helped my skin on my face. I wake feeling like I have healthy looking skin. I have noticed my skin is much brighter and smoother.

L'oreal gave me this product to try and I'm loving how the overnight moisturizer feels!! It exfoliate dull skin and helps reduces wrinkles and tones your skin! This product has done just that! I have so many people asking what I'm doing!! This is it! My skin feels fresher and brighter! Skin looks younger every time I use it! This is a must every woman needs this as her moisturizer you will not be disappointed!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I do not often have to use a moisturizer on my face. My skin is fairly oily and acne prone. I did use this a few days and although my skin did appear smoother and softer I also noticed my forehead becoming clogged so because of that I no longer used the product. I think it would be best for someone with a drier skin texture. Thanks for the try L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Tried this and was surprised with the results on my skin! I know some people giving rave reviews about this, but then there are a handful of people who don't fit this. Personally, I felt it worked great, and after using the entire range sent to me by L'Oreal (perks as a BzzAgent!), I can ser a brightening difference after two days! I am superimpressed ;) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the products that I got for free from L'Oréal are awesome. I have used it for about a week now. My skin is so soft. I use the scrub in the morning and then I put the brightening day moisturizer on before my makeup. I use the brightening pads at night after my face is clean then I apply the dual overnight moisturizer. I love the way it makes my face feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have tried a lot of moisturizers but hands down this one is much better. It's not greasy, doesn't bother my eyes. I wake up to brighter skin which makes me look younger. There is a slight fragrance but it is not overwhelmed. A little goes a long way. I use it in conjunction with the other Loreal revitalize products and I definitely see a big difference in my skin. My skin no longer looks tired and dull. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal kindly send me a free sample of L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal overnight moisturizer for a honest review of the product. I've used this for about a week now and wow what a difference a week makes. I don't have a lot of wrinkles and dark spots but you can hardly see them at all now and my face feels so smooth and soft.

"I received this for free from Loreal in exchange for my honest opinion. It's a serum in one side and a moisturizer in the other side, and when u pump it, they come out together. It seemed a little greasy for me, and I have sensitive acne prone skin, so I didn't like it. It wasn't as bad as the day cream but my skin still didn't agree with it. I had to discontinue use.

L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Dual Overnight Moisturizer is amazing. It makes my skin so soft. It brightens my skin. It is not harsh and does not irritate my skin.
