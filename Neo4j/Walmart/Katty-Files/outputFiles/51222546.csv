"I have to admit I was leary of exfoliating trice a day as well as using the rough feeling pad after washing. However, thanks to L'Oréal Paris and Buzzagent giving me the opportunity to try this line free I gage it a chance. They really prepared and did their research on this one! My skin looks fantastic and feels incredibly smooth! Well worth the retail cost. I'm considering replacing my higher end regular products with Revitalift! I can not argue with results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"We have noticed a definite improvement in skin texture, brightness, and firmness of skin."
I bought this a week ago and use it morning and night. I have drastically seen a difference in my face! I have comdonal closed acne and nothing had worked from OTC to prescription. This is the first thing to actually work!!! I use it with my other revitalift glycolic products!! I am in love and I want to say thank you for making products that actually work!!!
My 33 year old daughter bought this for herself last year. She barely ever used it so she casually gave it to me. I'm so ecstatic that she did because this is the only face wash I use now. In the year I've been using this my skin has become so smooth and soft and I've had a noticeable difference in the depth of wrinkles around my mouth and eyes. I love this so much. And it's inexpensive which makes me love it even more
Thank you L'oreal
Ok so I loved this as a exfoliator but .... I made a mistake and slept in this and it gave me a straight up chemical peel... A great one at that! I needed a peel for my dark spots and they're all gone.. I didn't do this on purpose though so I wouldnt suggest anyone trying this because skin is so different but I may try it again on my dark spots.. This seriously has gylocic acid so use wisely. If you sleep in it you will peel big time..trust me
"When I first wash my face with this product, my face felt sticky and not smooth or soft. After second wash it start to feel smooth and soft. Don't need a lot to wash, try maybe a pea size first and don't need a lot of pressure when scubing. I made a mistake doing it and my face was irritated."
I only uses it whenever I have to wear make up the whole day and I love how it deeply cleanses and exfoliates my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"If you are looking for a good product to take the dullness out of your skin and add a glow without doing it harshly this product is perfect. I noticed a new softness and glow within days of starting this product, which I use in conjuction with the makeup wipes and moisturizer."
So I am 57 years old and am blessed with really good fair skin. Was fortunate to have a Grandmother who insisted I wear sunscreen from age 10. I am noticing fine lines around my eyes and lips and blotchy dry skin on my neck and cheeks.I try new products constantly and when I saw this I grabbed it. I noticed softer skin the first use. There is a noticeable difference overall. My skin doesn't feel stripped of moisture. Give it a try. I think you will love it.
I have tried all the Loreal revitalift cleansers and loved this Bright reveal scrub cleanser the most. The texture and the uneven skin tone has really improved and my face looks smooth and brighter. The pores have vanished after using Loreal revitalift cleansers and creams.
This is amazing face wash!! I love how smooth my face is. I buy a lot of high end beauty products and this face wash is comparable if not better. Thank you Loreal Paris for allowing me to try this free of charge. There is no question I'll purchase in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this cleanser for many months after receiving a sample from L'Oreal. I switched from Aveeno daily brightener because this cleanser also exfoliates. I haven't noticed a big difference in brightness and I use it religiously twice a day. I do like that my sensitive skin is not irritated or dried out by this product. I do think it gets my skin cleaner than the Aveeno; which I noticed left makeup behind. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is really nice, compare to other scrubs, it's gentle and doesn't scratch or tear at the skin."
"I do notice a brighter appearance, and smooth feel after a few days of use. It's been just about a week and I like the results and how refresh I feel after every scrub."
"That is why I'm going to continue to use and try to bulk buy more, once I see a great deal."
"Love this facial wash! it can tingle intermittently. However, the powerful, work that it does mean more to me. I have Melasma with menopausal skin, that needs a constant powerful regimen for sloughing-off dead skin cells, more rapidly than most. So, this is one non-oily, more of a serum-gel-type, facial wash that works for my skin type. Thanks for the formula!"
"I have never had good skin - now at 60+ I have finally found a great cleanser, actually does improve tone and texture, and can see the difference. Glycolic acid much better than salicylic acid for my skin. To L'Oreal:Please do not change the formulation!"
"I bougth this two week ago.I love the results,does wonders.My face is so clear smooth radiant aand healthy.My face is so baby soft. I love this cleanser is not smushy,or greasy,or clumpy.It has a perfect texture and frangrance good price too for its size. And great value for your money wirth getting ,I highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
LOVE THIS GENTLE SCRUB. IT has tiny microbeads that feel so good against my skin. my face feels so smooth and clean. I follow up with the Revitalift products. I'm seeing a difference in my skin texture. This seems to be perfect for skin beginning to show signs of aging.
"I have been using this product for the past 6 months. I am very happy with the results. My face used to be dull in completion, but now it is much brighter. I'm one satisfied customer!!"
I love using the Revitalift Brightening products!!! They work well with my skin and really do reveal a brighter complexion. I think I have found my new skin care regime!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought this product last year, and I've been using it since . A little goes a long way . Super creamy and leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth."
I bought the complete line of Brightening products. I love this cleanser the most. It didn't strip my skin's natural oils. My face felt smoother and looked a little brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just started using it, but I am able to see a light difference. I will continue using it as directed and expect to see even more of a difference on my face."
I purchased the revitalift daily cleanser a couple days ago. I do not use it daily but it does leave skin feeling nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love the fresh orange scent! It leaves skin feeling clean and looking radiant. You definitely need a good moisturizer when you use this in winter. This is now my favorite face wash!
"I got my first tube of this probably three years ago as a sample. Regardless, I loved it so much, I am on my third tube that I have purchased out of my own funds. I keep it in my shower and use it two times a week. It is the only manual exfoliant I use. I find it to be gentle, but effective. If I feel l need a little pick me up, I'l leave it on a bit longer for a in-shower mask. The scrubby bits are gentle, but effective enough to help purge the occasional pesky blackhead."
I've been using this for only three days and I notice a difference after the second day! I have sunspots and some dark spots from overplucking. The dark spots from overplucking have almost completely disappeared. I wish I would have taken a before picture. My skin is very soft and smoothe. I've also noticed that some fine lines in between my eyebrows seem more faint. Thank you Revitalift! Thank you thank you!
"Started using this about 2 weeks ago and WOW. It really exfoliates, both gently but effectively. The clarity and tone of my skin has drastically improved. It also has a very pretty scent. My husband admitted to ""borrowing"" it a few times this week and he is very impressed, stating that he feels like he has ""new skin"". Will continue to purchase this!"
"I have been having issues with blemishes and acne in the last 2 years or so, but has gotten much worse in the last six months or so. This face wash has been helping out so much as long as I make sure I wash with it nightly. If I miss a night or two in a row I'll begin to notice acne popping up again."
"i love this product, when i first tried the SPF30 face moisturizer i was hooked i had to get the face wash and i am soooo glad that i did it works wonders, it removes the dead skin on your face and all the dirt and leaves your skin looking and glowing like new, but i wasn't sure if i should buy this or Garnier face products, i am so glad i bought this instead and i will continue to buy it from now on."
I love it is very good product .the exfoliation is deep. And you can see and feel your skin super rejuvenating
Do not buy this product! I just used once and my face really hurts!
This stuff is absolutely amazing! I use this every night after I remove my makeup. It is so exfoliating but not too much and it makes your skin so smooth and shiny! 100% recommend this to anyone!
I first tried this product a year ago and I really like it. I love when my skin feels completely cleansed and this does it. I would highly recommend giving this product a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this scrub. It is gentle and gets the job done as far as cleansing and making my skin look brighter. Using this product has definitely minimized outbreaks.
This product is an excellent face scrub. After using this I feel fresh and like my skin is glowing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I purchased this yesterday and saw immediate results. I love it. Can you tell me how I can sign up to get trial products. I am very interested in this line and would like to sample other items.
"I received this free through Bzzz Agent and love it . My skin is brighter , less pores and even my acne is going away . Definitely going to buy this when the tube I received free runs out . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Excellent product
I got this product free to test and review and so far I am loving it!. I have sensitive skin and it is mild and works great. It really cleans my face well. it does have a mild sent but not overwhelming. I really love it and would defiantly buy it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

it makes my skin nice and smooth. i love that cleanser for my night routine
I've been using this almost 3 weeks and I haven't noticed any results.
I have only been using this for a week but absolutely love how it makes my face feel afterwards!
I added this to my weekly regimen and it works great my skin has never looked better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love how this makes my skin feel so smooth. I can really tell that is evening out my skin and helps a lot with texture!
I love to use Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser
great product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I purchased this item along with other products from the Bright Reveal line around the first of January. I had high hopes.
"This face scrub does make your face feel soft, and it certainly does a great job of removing all makeup, etc., from your face. However, I do not feel that over a month of using it twice a day that it has made my complexion brighter. I will not be repurchasing this product, and I do not recommend it."
"I have fair to light skin and starting noticing a few dark spots from sun damage. This product erased the dark spots after a week or so of use and leaves my skin looking brighter, fresher and younger! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Bright Reveal scrub and the Cell Renewal rosy for about 2 weeks. I'm not sure which one is working, but my face has become more plump, my wrinkles are noticeably less, and i'm not using as much concelear on my age spots as i was. Thank you Loreal! I'm still in shock at the difference! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have combination skin with adult acne so I'm always looking for a good cleanser. My dermatologist recommended using a face wash with glycolic acid in it and I found this lovely product. As soon as I used it, I began noticing a difference. It made my skin smoother and cleaned right down into my pores."
"I was surprised that after just one use, my face felt fresher and smoother. After a week of twice daily use my skin was less dull and softer. Now after using this facial scrub for almost 2months, the sunspots on my checks and nose have really lightened up and wrinkles around my mouth are less noticeable. I will continue to use this as my daily cleanser! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this product for several days, I definitely feel like my skin is brighter and clearer. Wearing no makeup is not a challenge because my skin looks so great because of using this scrub everyday. It is not harsh on my sensitive skin and did not break me out and the smell is pretty pleasant. While it does exfoliate, it's a gentle one, and rinses clean. I'd definitely buy it if the price point were much lower! However, this is a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cleanser is great! I used it every morning and night. The gentle exfoliant in this cleanser leaves my skin feeling free of dullness and full of brightness! My skin used to be flaky, but since I've been using this, it looks great! If you have dry sensitive flaky red skin this is worth a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the Revitalift Daily cleaning scrub. I use it every morning in the shower and just love the way it makes my skin feel! It really does seem to make my skin brighter and it just feels clean and refreshed! It smells great too but not over fragrancy. I use it on my chest and neck as well and it never irritated my sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved how my skin felt after using Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. My skin felt much smoother than it does after most cleansers. The thing I liked the most is I could feel it exfoliate, but it didn't scrub my face harshly as some exfoliating products do. It didn't leave my face red and splotchy. This product did a good job of cleaning, and I would use it again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Used this as part of my morning and evening facial cleanser for the past 2 weeks along with the Moisturizer and Brightening Peel Pads. This helps makes my skin looking brighter and clearer. Highly recommend this product! I think this works very well with the moisturizer and brightening peel pads. I recommend using all three products to complement and make your skin looking great sooner.

"Im 45 mom of 5. I dont have a lot time for me so my face routine is important as a small pamper me time. I have this facial scrub to be effective, gentle, but effective all in one go. I could easly see me carrying this one in my car and use with facial wipes for those days when I'm sweating or more oily for quick clean up and refresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This daily cleansing scrub works well on my sensitive, combination skin. My T-Zone acne is diminished, my pores are tighter, my skin looks fresher and renewed. This skincare regime is effective at combating two things that can't usually be managed with one line, for me that's acne and skin dullness/fine lines. The scent is mild. The exfoliation is gentle. This is really worth it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think L'Oreal Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is a must have for every ones daily skin regimen. I was excited to try this product that I received from BzzAgent. I loved the clean fresh scent and how this scrub cleaned my skin. It left my skin feeling clean, fresh, and bright. My skin looked and felt wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just when you think your skin can't get any duller, this Daily face wash reveals a brighter more radiant skin that has been hiding. This daily cleanser is rich and delicate enough to use daily without stripping your skin of essential oils. My skin looked brighter and more toned after 2 weeks, without dryness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I typically use an all natural sugar or sea salt scrub which is quite a bit rougher of an exfoliant. This product did exfoliate fairly well and I would use it as a gentle every day cleaner, but I still felt the need to use my sugar scrub. I think this might be quite effective for some., but for me, this would have to be purchased in addition to my scrub and I dont feel the product is that spectacularc to warrant the additional purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So, after trying out the whole kit of Loreal Paris Brightening Daily Scrub, my face feels much brighter, and softer than before, i didn't see any difference with my fine lines but It was easy to use, it's felt so good scrubbing my face especially when I was done with the prices and my face felt to fresh and clean!! I will defiantly refined this scrub to my friends and family #Buzzagent # Loreal Paris Brightening Daily scrub. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cleanser was ""good enough"" for the days that my face didn't feel to grimy in the mornings, but on days where it was especially humid out I was a bit less than impressed. I like the scrub factor, but would have preferred a bit more foaming action. While this formula doesn't dry my face (I truly appreciate that) it also doesn't make my face feel especially clean, all the time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had the opportunity of trying the new L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection. All I can say is that I have switched my daily cleanser to L'oreal Paris Daily Scrub Cleanser. It leaves your face so clean and with a great fresh feeling. It not only does its job, but the smell is very pleasant. Happy new customer for L'Oreal Paris Brightening Daily Scrub Cleaner. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how this product made my face feel after washing my face with it. My face was so fresh and felt so clean. I also notice my skin becoming clearer. Only very little is needed so the product last for a great amount of time. I think this product is the one for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think my skin feels smoother and looks brighter since I started using Loreal Revitalift Bright Rteveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. I love the refreshing smell of the product. I will buy more of the Reviatlift products in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
As far as a exfoliate goes this product is a a good exfoliate. However I did not notice that it was much if any better than the other brands I have used in te past.I really did not notice that it made my skin any brighter either. I also noticed that it claims to have basically the same results as the peel pads and I did not understand why I should have to use both each day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this cleanser because it's not too harsh for my sensitive skin. It gently exfoliates and is something I can use every day. I feel like my skin tone is more even and my skin looks fresher after using this product. At night, I use the cleanser and my sonic facial cleansing brush to remove my makeup. This cleanser works really well at getting all the makeup off my face without having to use the cleanser more than once!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using Revtalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for 30 days I have noticed my skin looks brighter, fresher and more toned. I have to say after 30 days it makes me look younger, which is always a plus in my book. I had people in the office stop me asking what I was doing different. I told them about bzzagent and how I got the product to try. Many co workers went out to buy the products and a few signed up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think it was a little too harsh for my skin. I started peeling and my skin started getting red so I did have to stop the treatments. I was looking forward to brighter skin, but may have a little too much drying agents for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this for a few months and have liked it from the beginning. The micro beads were much finer than many other products I've tried and I like the grapefruit scent. My face felt soft, and clean. My skin was much brighter. The only problem I had was after using daily for @ a month, my skin felt dryer. I have changed my routine to only using it every other morning only. Now I'm much happier with the product@!"
"I would purchase this again for a cleanser/exfoliated, but I would not purchase it strictly for it's brightening claims. But I was not able to use the whole system because the moisturizers broke me out. It does a good job exfoliating. When I was rubbing it in it didn't feel like it was cleansing well (it's hard to explain) but it actually did a good job. Maybe because it doesn't suds up. Also, when rinsing it felt like something was being left behind. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've struggled over the years to find something that makes my face feel clean without feeling harsh on my skin. I was pleasantly surprised by how I felt after using the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. It really did the job but has not caused the irritation a lot of other products have. I would recommend the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am loving this cleanser. It has a nice fresh smell that reminds me of summertime. It has micro-beads which is something I usually look for when shopping for a facial cleanser. It has not dried my face out nor does it get oily. I would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the daytime and night time cream and i also used the scrub, I didn't care much for the smell. It was a citrus smell and i didn't care much for it. But, as a scrub and moisturizer i really did like it very much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to start using this system. I liked that I was receiving a full system from the same company. I used all the products daily for 20 days. On the 20th day, I decided that I gave it enough time and my face was so broke out by then. The cleanser has a nice scent to it, but I feel like when it was used with the whole system, my face broke out. On its own, it's probably a good cleanser, but I used as part of the whole system so I can't attest to it being that great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried numerous products and broke out. Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is amazing on your skin. I work outside and break out time to time , this product clears your skin and gives it a brightness just as the name describes. I have not found many products that live up to their name. This one does to a T. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used Revitalit Daily scrub until it was gone. I love the scent, light and fresh. It's just the right consistency and doesn't used microbeads. Loreal's Brightening Scrub really feels like it's scrubbing down to a fresh layer of skin without irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am coming to the end and I just want to say that I love the L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal combo and I am for sure going to keep buying it and keeping it in my skin care line. I used it every day and night as directed and I can see a big difference in my skin it feels so silky soft and looks so much more healthy and youthful. I had a lot of dark spots on my face and I can see them fading away and my skin tone evening out so it's doing what it's supposed to do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this scrub in the morning and evening. A little goes a long way. Moving in a circular motion, it forms a generous lather. This is gentle enough for daily use but packed with the good Stuff, like Glycolic. This is essential before application if creams and serum to allow for maximum absorption. I have definitely noticed more Radiant and even skin. No more struggle with dullness [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this scrub for over a month and i really love it. The scrub smells like oranges and has really big micro beads. I thought this was going to cause more redness and more peeling but it did not. This cleanser is seriously powerful and is very effective in exfoliating the outer layer of my skin. Right after using it, I can feel that my skin is smoother and, in fact, more evenly toned. This actually rinses away easily! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was very excited to try the Revitalift Loreal line. As soon as i recieved it i tried it out. The scrub went on well and it left my skin feeling silky smooth. I had to give it such a low rating due to the fact that the product line caused me to have an alleriace reaction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love L'Oréal revitalize bright reveal brightening face scrub! It leaves my face feeling clean, soft and it looks so much healthier. It doesn't dry my skin out or make it oily like lots of others have. This will be part of my daily skin routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub for almost 30 days now. At first I was worried that using it at night and in the morning would dry out my skin but it's gentle enough that it hasn't been a problem. My skin looks brighter and younger and feels softer. I love this product and will continue to use it after the trial. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub is absolutely amazing. I have had dry dull skin for as long as I can remember. After using this product in the morning and at night I noticed a big change in my skin after just a few weeks. My skin is much smoother and not dull looking. I no longer have dry areas on my face. This product has become a regular part of my skin care and will continue to be. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used the scrub every morning and night. It left my face feeling smooth, soft, refreshed and revived. It is not abrasive. It did not leave my face looking red or feeling irritated. In the mornings my face looked youthful and bright. I especially love the scent. It has just the right amount of scent, it is not overpowering. I will definitely be purchasing it in the future and recommending to friends and family. This will forever remain part of my skincare routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really love the cleanser; it's hard to find a drugstore brand cleanser that fits the sweet spot between too moisturizing and too drying. This one smells great, works well, and leaves my skin soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Wow I don't where to start I'm a loving this collection of skin care. I have notice the change in my face everyday as I continue to use it. My face more brighter, skin tone is more even and brown pigmentation is slowly going away. 8befire I used the reveal collection I had pigmentation on my fire head and my nose. 8i really can say it's going away. I tried other products and the scrub has been a part of collection to help with that [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a great face scrub to use in the morning shower. The smell is so great! I love how it smells clean with a light citrus scent. It lathers up well but doesn't feel soapy. It helps exfoliate your face gently. My face felt smoother and cleaner after using it. If you normally like to exfoliate your face I would recommend this product for a brighter, refreshed and more even skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a good cleanser but I wasn't able to use it daily. I have sensitive skin and this cleanser has SLS that dried my skin a lot. Leaving that detail aside, this is a fairly good cleanser, my skin felt clean and was glowing. I would recommend this to people that don't sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this stuff and I don't think I could ever go without it. It's that good. I use it morning and night. The scrub is not to harsh on my skin and makes my skin feel so clean and fresh. It doesn't take much of the product so it will last a while.. my skin looks so much brighter and radiant I will definitely keep this as part of my skincare routine. Morning and night.

I have used Oil of Olay and Aveeno but I am now addicted to this line of products! The Loreal revitalization cleanser with the microbeads leaves my skin feeling super clean and rinses cleanly away. I will be solely using the Loreal Revitalizing line! I cannot say enough great things about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Scrub is an amazing product. After one was, my face felt smoother, brighter, and more refreshed.

"I think the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is the best scrub product I have try for my face . I was looking for the best scrub for my age, 43. Some seen to dry my skin and others gave me allergies. I will specially keep buying this brand and recommend it . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the L'Oreal Bright Reveal is awesome. The pads make my skin feel so clean. I use them every morning. It makes my skin brighter and more radiant.

Cleanser smells fabulous and leaves my skin smooth and ready to absorb other products. I gave 4 stars because I don't know that I would use daily but I definitely will use when I want to exfoliate so maybe 3 times a week for me is enough. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I've always been critical of facial products but decided to give the L'Oréal 30 day challenge a try; I'm sure glad I did! I liked the feel of the daily scrub cleanser on my face and the fact that it removed dead skin cells to reveal new and bright skin underneath, plus its fragrance was just right for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is the BEST cleanser I have ever tried! I noticed an immediate improvement to my skin after using it the 1st time. I haven't used any other cleanser since getting this & will absolutely continue using it! My skin was instantly younger looking & not dull at all. It was not harsh or irritating & easily rinsed off. 10/10 will definitely buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser has become an essential part of my daily skin care routine. I use this product twice each day...once in the morning and once in the evening. It leaves my skin feeling super clean.

"I really liked this cleanser, especially since it has glycolic acid in it. The textured scrub felt good and lightly exfoliated my skin. My face felt clean afterwards. The only thing I wish this product had was the amount of glycolic acid it contains. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way the little scrubbing beads exfoliate on my face while using this product. I can feel it washing away the dead skin. My face feels so nice and smooth and soft after using. It also looks brighter even without makeup. I am a big fan of this product. You don't need to use much at all and it is plenty to wash your whole face. I will continue to use this. Thank you L'Oréal.

I wasn't so sure about using any of these products. I have sensitive skin and can't use much. These were all gentle on my skin and gave me amazing results in under a week. I have highly recommended to everyone I have talked to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have yet to find good daily scrub that wasnt to abrasive for my sensitive skin, till now. This scrub is gentle enough to use daily without making my skin feel beat up! I have pretty sensitive skin and other exfoliants have made me break out or turn rashy. I have had no problems with this product and using it with the other products from the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection has made a great improvement to the condition of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love that my face feels clean after I washad it with the loreal revitalift bright reveal daily scrub! As I have tried the whole revitalift line and the moisturizer leaves my skin way too greasy I love all the other products. Between the peel pads and the scrub every morning my face feels great.... Squeaky clean! My skin has gotten brighter and my wrinkles have faded this is a great scrub for daily use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Daily Scrub cleanser has a gentle pleasant smell to it. Very effective at removing my makeup at the end of the day, including my mascara. I don't feel like I have brighter skin but will defiantly buy some more since it does an awesome job cleaning and not making me feel dry after. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The scrub felt great at first and I love the light citrus scent. After a week or so, it felt like there was too much exfoliation. I began to break out. Whenever I have over-exfoliated in the past, I would break out in the same way. If I continued using it, it would only be a couple days per week and I'd use something gentler in between. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cleanser is great for breaking up the surface dirts and makeup gunks that can accumulate on your face. I like that it doesn't have a lot of drying acne medication in it, since my problem runs more towards the mature crowd. My skin felt smoother and clean, although the lack of sudsiness took a little getting used to. When used with the rest of the Bright Reveal skin line, this makes for a wonderful routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really love this cleanser. It exfoliates very nicely and is gentle enough to use every day. I use it in the morning and at night. It smells amazing, it's a light citrus/orange scent. I love it. I can't say I see much difference in my skin bright wise but it is very soft and smooth. I will be buying this when I run out. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the Daily Scrub Cleanser. I personally like a foamy face wash, but this cleanser left my skin feeling clean and refreshed. It feels smoother and actually less oily than it usually does! I've noticed the dull, uneven spots that really bugged me are not as noticeable [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This scrub is gentle, yet gets the job done. It actually felt really nice on my skin and after I used it, my skin felt so much cleaner and brighter. I think it does a great job of getting rid of the dead skin cells so you have that brighter feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the daily scrub. Leaves your face fresh and clean without harming your skin. Soft smoth skin with no redness. It cleans your skin without the harshness of some cleaners. I have had some previous problems with server redness. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a good daily cleanser for anyone who likes manual exfoliation. I'm not totally sure why you would need both the manual exfoliation along with the glycolic acid in the cleanser (especially if you were using the other products in the line) but it works well to give that clean feel. Overall, I prefer a more gentle cleanser and to keep my actives in the latter parts of my routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this for about 8 weeks now. I like the way it cleans my skin. Its a bit rough but didn't make my skin red. It cleaned all my makeup off my skin and left my skin feeling soft. I only like using this in the shower rather than at sink because at sink I couldn't remove all the cleanser but could during my morning showers. I will continue using this in my morning routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal is amazing and so happy that I got to be in this campaign. The face wash is great. The tiny beads that exfoliate your skin while washing leaves your face clean and fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used loreal revitalift bright reveal. I used brightening daily scrub cleanser. I received from @BzzAgent #IGotItFree. It made my face softer and cleaner. It actually does what it says,you get results if you use every day [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This daily scrub cleanser is a gentle, yet effective cleanser. Made my combination facial skin both soft and smooth. I thought it had a nice, light citrus fragrance. I was totally impressed by the gently scrubbing feeling without irritation of my sensitive skin. I actually looked forward to using this every day.

Hip Hip Horray!! Kudos to L'Oreal for out doing themselves once again! I amiss or should I say my skin is in love with all 4 of the new Revitalift Brightening Skin Products! Each product serves its own special purpose to improve not only your skin but your confidence as well!! Combined together L'Oreal has once again taken Skin CARE to a whole new level!! Thank You!!

"I was so excited to get the Revitalift campaign! I have used L'oreal products in the past and loved them. The first couple of weeks seemed ok, I thought my skin looked brighter, but then my normal to dry skin started getting irritated, dry and red. Then in the third week I actually had two breakouts and I am 43 years old and never get pimples! I guess the products were too harsh for my skin. I will not be using the face scrub cleanser anymore. So bummed out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using loreal revitalift bright reveal daily scrub about a month ago. It's very easy to use and has a pleasant scent.Isn't too expensive. My skin feels smoother and looks a little younger. I do recommend this line of products to friends. I will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is a really nice daily cleanser. This scrub is not too harsh. Unlike some other scrubs the Loreal Bright Reveal Scrub does not feel like I am using a handful of sand on my face. It has just enough of a ""scrub"" in it to make my skin feel clean without any irritation. I have seen an improvement in the brightness and smoothness of my skin since using this product. This is a product I would purchase in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"You know how they say not to over exfoliate? Well, I don't think this daily scrub cleanser applies to that. I use it every single day sometimes twice and my skin looks great! No breakouts,no dullness, not too oily, just a smooth clear face. I have had other 'daily' scrub cleansers that where way too harsh and would scratch the surface of my skin but I have not had that concern with this one. So glad I found a product that lives up to what it claims. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was happy to be able to try the entire collection of revitalift bright reveal. What was most helpful was that each box had a diagram showing what order to use each product. The daily scrub cleanser was easy to use and smelled nice. My outbreak did get slightly worse before it got better but I believe that is how it has to happen to make your skin better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I actually like the feel of the cleanser itself and my skin felt great after using the cleanser. I like that it's not a soap based cleanser - more of a gel. However....I have read a lot about the detrimental effects of micro beads and the environment and how more products are trying to get away from micro beads. I would love this product more if it didn't have it but I know that then it probably wouldn't scrub as much! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have always loved how the L'Oreal products work so well. I am so amazed at how the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser left my skin so soft and smooth after I washed my skin. It exfoliated my skin like no other cleanser has and my skin looks so healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that Loreal Bright Reveal scrub is my new favorite scrub! I usually use apricot scrub and this is so much better! It has just enough abrasion to make your skin smooth and soft. It doesn't have an unpleasant scent and you don't need a lot to do the job well. One bottle will last awhile. I would definitely recommend it to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin after using the scrub feels amazing. My pores are smaller and upon waking up my skin is glowing and is less oily. I will definitely be buying it again once mine is all gone, a little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cleanser was just the right consistency to be applied evenly. The cleansing material was not too abrasive and when used it felt very creamy and smooth. Once after rinsing the skin felt very refresh and noticeably more vibrant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love the Loreal Revitalift Brightening Scrub. I love using this morning and night, not only to remove makeup and dirt, it reveals a nice smoother texture afterwards. My skin feels clean, yet not tight and dry like some cleansers. I feel that my skin doesn't look so dull anymore. I will definitely continue with the Loreal Revitalift Scrub. I have combination skin and it cleanses just perfect! People started to notice a difference in my face. Love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loving the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. I use it every morning and evening. The scrub actually feels like it working and leaves my skin soft, clean and refreshed. I like it much more than scrubs I have used previously and I really think my skin is looking brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using all of the Revitalift products since recieving them and I sure have felt a nice improvement in the skin on my face! I think my wrinkles have improved and my skin just FEELS better. Although its winter here in Wisconsin and my skin would normally be very dry its fine this year. i will definatly keep buying all of the revitalift products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think I have too sensitive of skin for this or something. I really wanted to like these, but after giving it almost two weeks, I could not do it any more. My skin was breaking out in a rash all over my face. It almost looked like little tiny pimples all over, but they were itchy. I thought if I gave it time it would go away after my skin got used to it. But after almost two weeks, I could not stand it anymore. So I stopped using these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the cleanser! It had the right about of abrasiveness and it rinsed cleanly. My face has been very clear during the 30 day challenge. I love how a little bit goes a long way. I will for sure be using this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like that the cleanser has glycolic acid but think it may be a bit too harsh for daily use. Obviously, this is likely specific to my skin but my face felt a bit raw after cleansing with it for a few days. I reduced frequency to once every few days and my face felt much better. Not sure I would purchase and use again on my own because of that reaction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser!This cleanser is gentle enough to use every day.

"Looooved this scrub! I like that it is gentle enough to use daily, but it does exfoliate like a boss! I've bought scrubs before that were too harsh or didn't smooth my skin where I needed it most. The L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser got into all those tough to smooth areas, without making me feel like I was scrubbing my face off. The packaging is easy to use and I had no problem opening the lid with wet hands while showering. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is one of the best cleansers I have used. A light texture with a beautiful fragrance that's gentle on my skin. I love how it leaves my face feeling fresh, clean and smooth! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this line was not the one for me. The only thing it revealed was enlarged pores on my entire face and more acne than I have ever had. I do have to say that the product packaging is beautiful and the moisturizers have a nice light citrus scent. I do not think I will be purchasing these products, especially the peel pads. They were way too strong for my skin and caused burning and redness [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great concept however I'm not certain if it burnt my lips or not. Specifically the skin on the top of my upper lip. After a few days is usage my lip area was RAW and burnt. I had,a chemical burn. I got a bunch compliments from men and women about 3 days into using this about how radiant my skin looked. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Revitalift Daily Scrub Cleanser for over a month. I use it every morning in the shower. It is a thick gel with mini exfoliating dots. I rub it on in circles and rinse. It leaves my face feeling clean and very soft. I recommend this scrub for daily use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I went ahead and tried the 30 day challenge. The good news is that my skin feels much softer. Unfortunately my skin continued to break out. I stopped using the night moisturizer at two weeks because my skin felt to oily, but continued the rest. I do love how the cleanser makes my skin feel so I an going to use it until it is gone. Maybe it was just product overload. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser! The product has a nice, mild scent. The exfoliating micro-pearls felt great as I used the scrub on my face, I could feel it working. I didn't want to stop scrubbing! My skin was noticeably softer right away and brighter after just a few uses. I will continue to use this as part of my daily beauty regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Has a pleasant smell of oranges and cleans really well. I have smaller pores and my skin is soft I use the product twice daily. in the morning after I wake up and at night before I go to bed.

"I have waited to report any information about the RevitaLift product line until I had a good idea of what it would do for my skin.

"I honestly cannot believe how soft, healthy and radiant my skin is after having used the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for just two weeks. The gentle microbeads leave your skin feeling so smooth. Its like having a mini-microdermabrasion session except that its gentle enough to use every day.

Out of everything this was my favorite product. I felt the scrub exfoliated nicely and left my skin soft. Disappointed there was no noticeable brightening or evening of my skin tone. I used this every evening before bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I don't usually follow a routine but I took the 30 day Challenge and I really like the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection.

I will continue to use this product and recommend that others give it a try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Using this product was simple. Though for me I only used it at night instead of twice daily which is what they recommended. Great citrus smell, small micro beads to gentle scrub your skin as you massage your face, once you rinse, you will be amazed by how soft your skin feels!! Afterwards, your to gently use the peel pads... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Loreal Revitalift Daily Scrub Cleanser daily and it is fantastic. I use it during the morning as my normal skin routine and it feels gentle on my skin.

Have been using the product for about a month now and it is a very nice cleanser. Works good at removing make up skin feels soft have not had any break outs.

"I loved this scrub, the smell was amazing! My skin felt so clean after using it. It exfoliated and left my skin feeling fresh, without being harsh or abrasive. I honestly saw an improvement in my skin tone and a reduction in acne breakouts. L'Oreal never claimed to do anything for acne but I know it has helped my skin by removing dead cells and buildup!

There is no greasy feeling, or build up. Just fresh bright skin. I was scared that they would irritate my skin, but after using these everyday for weeks, there has been no irritation. I started out testing a spot on my skin first two nights. All feels and looks wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the L Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is GREAT! The texture was just right, not too rough of a scrub but not too fine so that it doesn't work.

The smell is pleasant, it lathers nice, and I look forward to using it every day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was on the fence about this product, due to my oily, sensitive skin. But I was sooo impressed with the results that I saw with it.

I think this will be my new daily gentle cleanser. I have been using it now for 2wks and have noticed a much cleaning looking and feeling skin. There is no left over residue feeling or drying after effect. When combined with the other products....L'OREAL REVITALIFT will be my new face care product of choice.

"I think this product most likely cleans well, but for me, I do not like the harsh granules in cleansers. This is a personal preference and just from the research I have done, I don't feel that these hard particles in the cleanser are good for your skin. I won't continue to use this cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This line of L'Oreal skin care is awesome! I have been using all the products on a daily basis and I can definitely see a difference in the texture of my skin.

I tried L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening daily Scrub Cleanser and my honest review is that this scrub is wonderful! You don't need a lot of the scrub for it to work either.

"I wish I had taken before and after photos as there is such a difference! These L'Oreal products have eliminated my under eye circles and have evened out my uneven skin tone.

I think this is the best regiment for revitalizingredients your skin! I have used all 4 products and I'm hooked. I was hesitant at first because of the scrub cleanser and being to rough on my skin.

The new Revitalift brightening line by L'Oreal is awesome! The cleanser is nice and scrubby without irritating my skin.

I love the Daily Scrub Cleanser it lives my skin super clean and fresh. I use it every nigh and morning to keep my pores clean of any dirt or makeup. I follow it with the daily moisturizer cream to maintain my skin hydrated all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I feel that this scrub did a great job removing dead skin & making my skin feel clean. I didn't notice a change in skin tone or brightness however. I felt it made my skin soft however. I did not care for the chemical like feel and I thought it could use a fresh or natural scent to make the experience more enjoyable. Such as an essential oil or spa like scent.

The brightening scrub really improved the look of my skin! It scrubbed away all those dead skin cells that had been blocking my natural glow. The only issue I had was that my face seemed to be more prone to breakouts while I was using the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used this Loreal Bright reveal daily scrub every single day since I got it. So that's about a month!!! I noticed a difference at week one. I no longer had the tired dull look anymore. Thus product really brightens up your skin. Its gentle enough for daily use and does not irritate the skin. All 4 products work great together but if you use them alone you still get results.

I think that this product is amazing. It makes my skin feel and look so soft. I have been using this everyday for 30 days now and can see a real difference.

I really love to use L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser every morning when I take a shower for my neck and chest.

"I think this is an awesome product. I used it for thirty days in the 30 day challenge, along with the rest of the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection. My skin is softer and brighter. I used to have these color splotches on my cheeks and they are gone. I loved the beads and the feeling of getting a facial every time. It is very easy to get addicted to this product. If I had slept in late I would get up just to scrub with this. It is definitely something you want to try!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the Daily Scrub Cleanser. The microbeads really makes your face feel clean. No dirt or oil is left behind. I have sensitive skin and I am very happy to say that I had no breakout, oily or dry skin resulting is use of this product. I don't really see that my skin is brighter, but my natural oils are more under control than with the previous face cleanser I was using. I would definately recommend it to others.

"I have been using the L'Oreal Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for a month now each day while in the shower. It's a great deep cleanser that can be used daily without over-stripping your skin. I can tell my skin looks and feels more clean when using this product than when I use a regular cleanser. When used with the other L'Oreal Revitalift line, my skin feels more youthful and smooth. It's definitely a product that I will purchase on my own after this bottle runs out.

"The cleanser feels like a scrub. A facial scrub is something I use about once or twice a month. I have sensitive skin but BzzAgent was kind enough to let me try these products, so away I go. I did use most of these products for 4 weeks. I had no adverse reactions which is a big plus. I do like the cleanser/scrub. It's a nice addition to my skin care routine. Though, I didn't see any significant brightening to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the daily scrub every other day as it's been over drying my skin, my face is a little sensitive. I haven't really seen a difference in how it's helped with wrinkles or for brightening of my face, but I'll give it all it has! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I use it first thing in the morning and then again before bed. I use a small amount and it does the trick. You can feel is cleaning! The best thing is that I have sensitive skin and it doesn't leave it red or irritated if I lather a little extra or wash a few seconds longer! This is a new must have for my beauty/face care routine! Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
While enjoyed the feel of my skin after washing with the scrub. After about 10 days my skin started to dry out and peel and itch. I don't know if it was this specific product or a combjnation of the other products that had that effect in my skin. I had to take a break for a few days and then only used the product every 2-3 days to avoid the irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love love the daily scrub! It has a lot of exfoliation beads not like other brands I've tried. You dont need a lot of it either which is great for your wallet too :) It can be used on a dry or wet face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have my regular scrubs that I've been using for years, so I wouldn't have picked this off the shelf, but I'm so glad I was able to try it! The consistency is great and you don't have that thing where the scrubbies fall off your face before you even get a change to start scrubbing. Its perfectly abrasive without being too harsh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used the face scrub for a few weeks now. I absolutely love the smell & how my skin feels afterwards, but as far as the 'scrub' goes it does not have enough grit in it to be considered a good scrub. With that being said I did like the feel of the face wash & used it as such and not as a scrub. My daughter used it & had never used a scrub before & absolutely loved it. She thought that it did a great job on her face & lived how it felt afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think it's an ok skin care product. It's a lite style of scurb which isn't bad, it'll leave your face feeling clean without drying it out. After using this regimen of skin care for a week I broke out bad. I continued using this regimen for another week and I stopped because it got worse. Sadly I have to say that I don't know if I would use this skin care system again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this scrub! Exfoliating without drying! My skin really does look brighter!!! I've used it everyday, twice a day! My skin feels smooth and so clean! The scent is clean and not perfume laced. Highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This scrub did not leave any residues or dried out my skin. My skin felt clean and soft. I always expect some type of dryness or breakout since I have combination skin. If you want a real clean face cleanser, I would recommend to try this facial scrub. You will love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I truly believe after one full month of using this product it is a great face scrub. It does brighten the skin like it claims to that's a pro and the fragrance is lovely another pro. However, it is a bit harsh for sensitive skin. Not over kill burn your skin off just a little too much for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Revitalift daily scrub cleaner. I was skeptical at first as I have used other products that have ""claimed"" to do the same thing but I was in for a total shock! It is wonderful and my skin has never felt better. I was told by several people that they didn't know what I was doing but I was looking younger! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
i think this scrub is amazing! I've been using it for 2 weeks and have noticed a big difference in the texture and smoothness of my skin. Mt skin is more even toned and very soft. this scrub is gentle enough to use everyday. i will purchase this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used the Revitalift Bright daily scrub cleanser for 3 weeks and my skin improved so much. Nothing I have ever used has worked so well. My skin feels firmer and looks younger. Used along with the rest of the cleansing line made my skin feel amazing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very excited to try this product at is just something that I have never heard of before. I loved the faint scent, it was pleasant. I also liked the tiny microbeads, it really felt as though it was cleaning my face. However, I did not notice any brightening of my skin during the duration that I was using it. I also even ended up having to pimples, which is very unusual to me but I will chalk it up to changing up my normal skin regimen. Overall I was hoping for a much better results.

I love this cleanser! I use it every day in the shower and at night to take my makeup off. It has a nice scrub to it and hummus feel.

All of the Revitalift Bright Reveal products have a nice smell and are easy to use. They work together to create cleaner, younger looking skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received Loreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening daily scrub free from Bzzagent to try and I so glad that I was chosen to review it. My skin can be sensitive sometimes but this scrub was gentle enough to wash my face and leave it fresh and soft. I even got complimented on looking so young when I ran into old friends for the holidays. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Revitalize Bright Reveal Day scrub is a luxurious facial scrub that has my face feeling soft and smooth. It goes on smoothly without scratching m6 skin. The lather is ample and the product smells nice. After just a few days I can both feel and see the difference in my skins appearance. I have fine lines around my mouth and eyes. This scrub along with the other L'Oréal products will be my daily routine now over any other products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have problematic skin. I had great skin throughout my teen years and then was hit with cystic acne in my 20s. I found my solution to clear up my skin and now as I enter my late 30s, I am dealing with the usual dull, uneven skin tone. L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser has changed my life. I am brighter, my skin is softer and I GLOW. G.L.O.W. There's no going back!

"This scrub is WONDERFUL! The little microbeads are super exfoliating, but NOT harsh at all. The scent is a light citrus. I am sensitive to breakouts and had no issues with this scrub. It goes on easily and rinses off completely...no yucky residue. It makes your skin feel awake and super SOFT [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used the Revitalift Bright Reveal for 30 days and I found the products to work great for softening the skin. I did notice it brightened my skin, but my sun spots are still there and didn't fade too much. My favorite product was the Daily scrub cleanser as the tiny beads helped exfoliates my skin and made it feel softer and brighter and helped my makeup go on smoother. Warning~use water and scrub gently or you can cause irritation to the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cleanser is one of the better one's I've used. It's gentle leaving your skin feel smooth. It's not harsh as some of the others I've used. It leaves your skin feeling hydrated but not oily. I plan on making this a staple in my morning routine every day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oreal Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub did wonders for my skin! It really helped to brighten my skin and get rid of the little dry areas. i also noticed less clogged pores and an overall smoothness to my face (especially on the cheeks and chin). The nice scent was just a bonus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am in love. After using it all, and buying more I could not be more impressed. My skin felt so clean and refreshed after just the first use. Every morning I use the scrub and I can feel it removing dead skin and giving my skin a cool clean feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried alot of facial cleansers before and they leave my skin super dried. So I tried this one and it leaves my skin very soft and not dried at all. Though I feel it doesn't really clean my face 100 percent but I use it right after I use a cleansing water and then this and it worst great this way. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like this Beauty system. The scrub cleanser, peel pads, day & night moisturizer all work well together!!! I was worried that I would either break out or get overly dried, none of which happened. I highly recommend the full system because they work well together and your skin will look much better. At least mine did. Well worth the $$ you will spend.

"I think this cleanser is nice, but not for every day use. At 46 it is a bit harsh on my skin. I prefer a creamy, mild cleanser for every day, but would use this a couple of time a week to give myself a nice deep clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"THIS IS GREAT PRODUCT, I HAVE TO USE IT EVERY 3 TIMES A WEEK. SO MY SKIN DOSENT GET TO GET IRRITATED. IT DOES WORK OVER TIME, YOU JUST HAVE TO A ROUTINE THAT WORKS BEST FOR YOUR SKIN.

"Coming towards the end of the 30-Day Challenge L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection campaign. I'm 38 and my skin has a renewed, glowing look and no more acne! My skin is soft, smooth and my complexion has evened out! Kudos to you L'oreal! This product worked great with my fair, porcelain, sensitive, acne, psoriasis prone skin!

"I think that the w L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily scrub is absolutely awesome. Immediately after trying it, I noticed a difference in my skin. I washed my face and it was gently exfoliated. I rinsed it and my face was noticeably clean and brighter. After one week, my complexion was clearer. I will definitely purchase this!

I have been using the revitalift brightening daily scrub morning and night. Love how my face feels but not sure if the product is for removing the makeup that was worn all day. It seems to be working well on my face but still see a lot of makeup on the peel Pads. My skin looks better and feels better than before. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I love the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. I am most impressed with the scrub not being as gritty as most scrubs. The scrub has a nice citrus scent, or atleast mine does. My face feels soft and clean after each use. The product rinses off quickly and easily without a residue left on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have super oily skin, I really wanted to like scrub. It feels great against my skin, I loved that you felt the texture of the scrub and the scent, it's very suttle. The down side for oily skin is that about an hour after washing my face it's oily again. I wouldn't buy it again, but I think my dislike is mostly, because my skin is so oily.

"I have used this cleanser for about a month now. I love the way it makes my skin feel. It cleans and exfoliates without over-drying or leaving a film on your skin. I was concerned that I would have problems with redness and irritability because it contains glycolic acid, but I did not have any issues with it, and I used it twice a day. It also has a nice, citrus scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love L'Oreal's Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. I've been using it every morning and night for nearly a month, and my skin hasn't looked this great for years!

"I use the loreal face scrub daily with the other loreal products I've received, I'm brand loyal and was hesitant on the ""brightness"" part but I'm impressed I've seen a youthful brightness.

This is a great product that works really well compared to plenty others i've tried in the past. Revitalift scrub gets rid of your impurities while helping with the fine lines and wrinkles. It leaves your skin feeling fresh and silky smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this is the best exfoliating cleanser I've ever used. The smell is fruity and kind of light. It really does feel like it's scrubbing your skin but not hurting your skin. I love it and I will continue to use it. I did notice within the first few days my skin was softer I did notice a noticeable appearance difference in my skin. After a month of using it I did notice that my acne was flaring up I was getting horrible zits. I had to go back to my benzoyl peroxide cleanser once a day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I LOVE using the daily scrub. I have had trouble getting my face clean without a washcloth, but using a washcloth drys out my skin. Using the daily scrub doesn't dry out my skin and it gets it so fresh and clean and it makes my skin look SO BRIGHT! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had gone to a friend's house the other day and had stood up from the couch for something and there happen to be a big mirror hanging on the wall.

Hahaha my skin looks amazing!! #GOTITFREE #BZZAGENT #LOREALPARIS [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cleanser has a nice consistency where it's not to harsh but it gets the job done. It has a nice light clean scent to it too. The bottle does not get messy either. But don't stop there. I use all four products in this line and have received compliments on how much better my skin looks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this scrub is fantasic! It leaves my skin feeling so soft bc it exfoliates my skin without drying it out. I use it morning and night and Ive noticed that my skin looks a lot brighter. Its gentle enough for sensitive skin except if you have a sunburn or acne. It's probably one of the best scrubs I've ever tried and I didnt have to pay and arm and a leg. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have super sensitive skin and had a hard time with all the products in this line. I really wanted it to work well for me, but my face felt like it was burning and I broke out from the line. Like I said, my skin is pretty sensitive so I may not have been the best person to try. I have used some of LoreL cosmetics over the years and did okay with them so I figured I would try it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is one of the best scrubs on the market today. This scrub leaves your skin looking refreshed and brighter then before. I used this product daily and i have never been more impressed with my skin! I will be making this a routine in my daily face washing from here on out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It felt good the first time I used the scrub. My skin felt softer. But I found out that using it everyday twice a day is too harsh on my skin. It felt like I was exfoliating my face twice a day and my skin was getting red and sensitive. I would recommend using this maybe twice a week instead.

"This scrub has changed my life!! I have used it every day, day and night for a month and I'm telling you it's great!! My skin is cleaner, clearer, and brighter than ever!! I still can't believe what a good price it is?? I love the little grit to this scrub!! It cleans deeper than other cleansers I have tried yet leaves a gentle, clean feeling!! It leaves my skin feeling soft and youthful, it is amazing!! You must try it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Since using Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser I feel like I have a new face. I mean people have even asked what I'm using because my face looks so much more healthier. That's a plus for me!! Yup I'm using it every day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was skeptical before trying the Revitalift Bright Reveal cleanser, as I have been using a different cleanser for several years. I have, however, been pleasantly surprised by the Revitalift cleanser, as it exfoliates well and leaves my face feeling smooth. I do find that my face really needs moisturizer after using this product. I have used this cleanser for a couple weeks now and I like it enough that I will consider purchasing it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the way it leaves my skin but it dont remove makeup that great. You can actually feel it after you have used it but it does exfoliate really good. I went to a wedding and I got compliments about how great my skin looks. I felt real confident that night and everyday knowing my skin looks better.

"I normally don't care for scrubs. I'm afraid they are too abrasive. The Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub is gentle and after using several times a week,is a key component to a beautiful complexion. My skin looks more youthful and clearer. My sun damage is definitely lighter. I feel more confident and beautiful. I will definitely continue using as a part of my weekly skin regiment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this product. I have used it for 2 weeks now and my complextion hasn't looked this healthy in awhile. It is not harsh on your skin like a lot of the other daily scrubs. once used you face is soft and smooth and feels refreshed. it doesn't leave that filmy feeling like other scrubs..i highly recommend this product!!!

"I really think LorealParis'new Revitalift products are great so far. I had already feel like my face is cleaner and fresher feeling after the first use. Although I have experienced a little bit of a break out the first week . After continually use during this past use it seems to be brightening my skin tone some but I haven't really noticed a difference in my wrinkles around my eyes especially. All in all, I would recommend this product to anyone of my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I actually use this scrub in the shower because when I rinse it from my face I also use it on the rest of my body. Living in CO we have pretty dry weather....this stuff made my skin feel so great! Again, such a luxurious experience! It really is gentle enough for the face and strong enough for the body! One more thing....after using I felt like I had put some light lotion on because this stuff is soooo nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product smells great, the loreal revitalize but if you have sensitive skin they may not be for you. I used it for a week straight to give bit a chance. Each day it left my skin red and bumpy. I would say not for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really wanted to like this whole line. I really did, but this product line caused me to breakout. I never get zits, and I haven't been using anything else that's different from my normal, so I know it's this product line. I'm really bummed. I've wanted to try this product line, due to the fact that I'm getting older, and I really need to start taking care of my skin, especially my face. Now I have to try to get rid of these zits on my face. So bummed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the light smell of this product. Most facial cleaner have a strong smell that discourages one from using them daily. This product leaves your face very smooth, and soft. I felt that my face was really clean and and started seeing a more even tone after a few days of use. I have combination skin tone and this helped all areas.

So far I have been using the LOreal Daily Scrub Cleanser and I love it. I can see all the makeup and dirt I guess in the sink when I wash my face at night. I follow it up by using the LOreal overnight moisterizer. They are a great combination. My face feels so smooth and clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved using the revitalift bright reveal brightening daiy scrubceaner that the L'Oreal company sent to me for free. The first day I used it I could feel a difference iin my skin. It was immediately softer. There was no hoarseness to the scrub. It says to use daily but I use every other day. I love this scrub. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's fantastic! Leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh without drying! It has beads, but not abrasive. I even used with my electric face brush, the scrub did a great job cleaning, but not stripping my face. Plus a little goes a long way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Revitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser has a very fulfilling feel after it is washed off! As I am rubbing in the cleanser my face feels slightly tingly which hits that something good is working! After I use water to remove, my skin feels sensational. All the dead skin is exfoliated making my skin look younger and feel great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have to say I was very skeptical when starting this beauty regiment. I have tried so many with bad results. This one is completely different! I have been using the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for about 30 days now and my skin has never looked better. I have clear and smooth skin that is so soft. I will be continuing to use this product along with the others in the product line!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved this scrub. I noticed more radiant skin before the first week. It feels wonderful on my skin. It is soft and gentle and feels like a luxurious product. It is invigorating with the micro-pearls that gently scrub dead skin cells away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Started using the facial scrub twice a day almost a month ago. I like the scrubbing beads in it. Has a light scent. Worked great with my facial brush. My skin feels cleaner and I have less blackheads. The only issue I had was that the scrubbing beads would get stuck in my scars, with a little more rinsing they came right out.

great scrub and since I been using this my skin feel really clean and soft what I like about the gel is that it has tiny little beads that act as a scrubber when you massage into your skin I like the smell and after I use it the gel rince clean [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser daily and have noticed a nice difference in my skin! In the mornings I feel like the cleanser buffs away my old dull skin and helps wake up my skin! At night, it helps clean my face thoroughly and rids my skin of the day's impurities. My only complaint is that you can't really use it around the gentle eye skin, so I always had leftover eye makeup that I needed to remove separately. Otherwise I enjoyed this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like the cleanser. It lightly exfoliates yet cleans pores and makes your skin feel soft without feeling dry as some cleaners. It does leave light granules on skin so be sure to completely rinse your face and neck. I do see softer skin and with longer use I think those fine lines will thing off the old skin. It reveals your new creamy complexion! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"THE REVITALIFT BRIGHT REVEAL BRIGHTENING DAILY SCRUB CLEANSER WAS AWESOME!!!! IT WAS A GREAT DAY TO START THE DAY. THE TINY SCRUBBERS INSIDE GOT RID OF THE DIRT, AND GRIME, AND DEAD SKIN OF THE DAY.

Finally a scrub cleanser that is not only tough enough button gentle to be used every day! Many scrubs limit you to once a week usage due to it being too rough on your skin but finally Loreal has come out with a product that not only is gentle enough but it makes your skin's overall appearance a number one priority!!

"I have a myriad of skin issues so I always have to experiment carefully to look for an effective yet gentle scrub and cleanser as I age. I only need a small amount of this Revitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser and felt clean and refined, without irritation when used in small amounts. Those with aging skin and sensitivity need not worry when searching for a good combo wash/scrub, as this affordable pick does the trick! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a product junkie. I love to try new face products. Often I spend a ton of $$ and am disappointed. As I've gotten ""older"", I've noticed my skin gets dry very easily. When I apply makeup it looks flakey and ewww....I used this scrub cleanser and the Revitalift system and I feel like I have my old fresh face back! My skin is so smooth!! When you hit middle age it's little things like good skin care that make you just feel better! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for a few weeks now and have really noticed a difference in how smooth my skin is. I actually received two random compliments on how great my skin looks in the last two weeks. Nothing better than that! I have sensitive skin so I use the scrub every other day in the shower. It's not too harsh on my skin and really makes it glow! I'd definitely recommend this product. #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have sensitive skin, so any scrubs that I use will make my face irritated. I cannot use this scrub daily, and it takes extra time for me to blend the cleanser in my hands to make sure that the scrub beads do not irritate my face. Unfortunately, I can only use this cleanser a few times a week. It does help in reducing the dead skin off my face and make it more brighter but I wish the scrubbing beads were smaller so they are not so irritating.

I have been using the daily scrub for about 3 weeks now. I like the smooth texture of my skin now. I can't use it every day because I have sensitive skin. It's a great product and good value for the money. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The cleanser along with the moisturizers & peel pads have made my skin look great. I was afraid the scrub & peel pads would be too harsh together but they werent. Ive managed to get rid of blackheads that no mask or pore strip could treat. Fine line have been a little blurred, and the overall tone of my skin has improved.

I think that this scrub works very well. I use it in the morning at the beginning of my shower. I find that my oily complexion has gotten better over time with this scrub. It seems as though my skin feels tighter and more smooth once I started using it. I feel like this is a great product for me to continue to use as part of my daily routine due to the clean and fresh feeling of my skin. This will be my new face scrub.

I have been using the Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser and am very pleased with the results. It feels like it is taking off the excess dead layer of skin and really helping my skin look brighter. I am telling all my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like this cleanser but have had some sensitivity to it. Perhaps, the sensitivity it due to the my skin shedding dead skin cells. I lather this into my clean, wet hands & massage using circular motions. I can feel the micro beads working. The smell is refreshing, leaves my skin feeling refreshed, exfoliated & smooth. I've actually been able to go without foundation or less as a result of this product. Also, the price point is great for this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a pretty awesome product. I have also been using on my chest and neck. This is where I have seen most of the improvement. This cleanser has a nice scrub feel and scent to it. I use it every other day as I think that my skin could be a little sensitive but overall this product delivers! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed the light, citrusy scent and the gentle feel exfoliating. My face felt clean and soft after using, as well. However, all these things are true of my fall-to products. I am always looking for the next ""miracle"" product like anyone else. But this one wasn't one for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for about a month now. It is a great cleanser. I use it in the mornings and also at night. I do feel like my skin feels brighter/less dull after using this product. It is easy and fast to use and I like how even though it is a scrub, it feels gentle on my skin. I would recommend trying this product. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because none of my friends noticed any difference in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After four weeks, I have noticed less breakouts and pimples after using the cleanser, pads and moisturizer. I can't say that I notice my skin is brighter or wrinkles are minimized but it does feel soft and clean after use and is not oily at all. I love the smell and the light scrub from the exfoliating beads is refreshing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Really liked the way it makes my face feel with very little product used. My face seems to be clearer and brighter as well. Will be interested to see what my face is like after the arrival of my baby. It has improved greatly already. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"When summer turned to fall and my tan started to fade, I noticed that my skin was dull and had an uneven tone to it. After about a week of using L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser, I noticed a remarkable difference in my skin's texture and brightness. I can't wait to see what my skin looks like when I've finished using the entire bottle! I would highly recommend this product to friends, family, or anyone looking to exfoliate and brighten their skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This was a pretty basic cleanser and after using it regularly for a month I haven't noticed much difference in my skin. I'm typically skeptical of cleansers that have any type of active ingredient (like Glycolic Acid) since they usually aren't on your face enough time to make a difference. I won't be purchasing this when I run out - I'll stick with a gentler, basic cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really think this may be my favorite product of the entire line. I use this at least twice a day. It leaves my skin clean and soft without that dry tight feeling. The exfoliating bits inside are not to big that they hurt, nor to small that they don't feel like they are accomplishing anything. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering. This takes off my makeup and makes my entire face feel fresh and revived. I can't recommend this one enough!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the bright reveal daily scrub for several weeks now. I love how it makes my skin have a more even texture after using and my face feels and looks so clean. It isn't drying and my skin tends to be sensitive but haven't seen any problems with it. My little wrinkles seem to be less noticeable as well. I love the product and will definitely buy!

"I am in love with the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection! The L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser has done wonders for my skin. The first week I noticed my face was glowing! The scrub is easy to use and leaves my face soft and brighter. The scrub is scented well and a little goes a long way! Gone is the overly tight skin, gone is the dull lifeless luster. I am very happy with the entire L'Oreal line! I am now a convert! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoy using the daily scrub cleanser. I have definitely noticed a difference in my skin (smoother appearance) since using this system. I think the scrub has definitely added to this smoother appearance and leaves my skin feeling clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked this product. It has just the right amount of abrasives in it. It leaves my face feeling extremely clean and my skin looks better than it has in a long time. Make sure to follow-up with the moisturizer- it is a little drying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"First off, I gave this 4 stars because it calls itself a daily scrub. It is too harsh for me to use it everyday. However, I feel it's gentle enough for me to use it 2-3 times a week. It has a nice fresh scent. My skin feels soft and smooth after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I really enjoyed using the Loreal Revilatlift scrub. My skin felt immediately softer after first use as it gently removed dead skin cells. Im very pleased with results as my skin is noticeably brighter not as dull as it was i really like uzing the combination of the Loreal Paris products it is a real treat, as well the packaging is very attractive. Love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked it... I honestly think I will continue using. After about a week of using the skin on my cheeks started to peel once I scrubbed it off it didn't do it anymore but now even in the mornings before washing my face it looks more refreshed and clean, so that means I don't look so tired in the mornings. My skin is more smoother than it was before!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I usually have to use a brush to exfoliate at night and take all my makeup off, but this wash exfoliates so well that I don't need to use one! My skin is smooth and glows! It doesn't dry out my skin and I know it's helping with my sunspots as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using with the exfoliating ingredients in it my skin felt so smooth and fresh. No irritation and felt amazing. Using the other products like day cream and night cream with it keeps your skin feeling soft [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the revivalift bright reveal brightening scrub cleanser. This scrub is not harsh on the skin and gets the job done. Since using the scrub my face is softer and many of my dark spots have lightened up. Before using it I had dark lines along the sides of my nose and now it's gone on one side and almost gone on the other. I think this scrub is great.

"Well today I am celebrating day 32 of L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal products. My new favorite cleanser: L'Oreal Brightening Daily Scrub, does more than clean. It makes my face feel fresh.... without the sting or tingle. It feels tighter, cleaner, and fresher. You feel it working right away without a harsh reaction. You only need a pea size. Try it! You will thank me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this scrub works great in deep cleansing the skin and pores. My pores are smaller and my face is not oily. It does leave my face a bit dry but I follow up with the moisturizer and it feels smooth and refreshed. It definitely evened out my skin tone. No red, blotchy areas, which is great. I would continue using this because it addresses my current situation (smaller pores and even tone). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the products since I've received them and this scrub had made my skin smoother and brighter. I started noticing a difference after one week! @LOrealMakeUp, #BrightReveal and #GotItFree. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Revitalift Bright Reveal daily scrub has a such wonderful refreshing smell. It makes my skin feel clean and happy! So far I haven't noticed much of a difference in the look of my skin but after I wash, it definitely feels smooth. I asked my coworkers to tell me if they begin to notice any difference. No comments so far. I am hopeful though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have never used any kind of skincare from l'oréal this was the perfect opportunity to give it try and I must admit, noticed a BIG HUGE DIFFERENCE in the tone of my skin, texture and clarity. The little fines I was developing starting to diminished. My skin looks fresher, more radiant... Soft to the touch. My husband even noticed the difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this product with the rest of the L'Oreal Revitalift products in this line. It has a nice light citrusy smell and micro beads for exfoliation. I used the face cleanser twice daily and the other coinciding products once a day. I have an uneven skin tone and in just a couple weeks of use I can see a big difference. My skin also looks brighter and more polished. I will continue to use this cleanser in my daily skin care regiment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this facial scrub for almost a month now and I love the way my skin feels! It's smoother, my pores are SMALLER!!! I've tried a lot of things to make my pores smaller and nothing else has come close to these results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is the best scrubbing cleanser I have ever used. This not only brightens, but actually lightens dark patches on your skin. It is not drying and does not irritate your skin. My skin looked exfoliated, bright and smooth after only one use. I have been using it every evening and I have experienced absolutely no irritation, but have noticed a lot of lightening on dark patches. I would definitely purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The scrub is awesome! It has little beads that helps exfoliate your skin without being too harsh! It has a pleasing light citrus scent, and it washes off without leaving a film behind. It has helped my skin with sun damage and seems to have diminished some fine lines and brightened my skin . I will recommend to everyone and I will repurchase in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked this scrub. I have used other citrus scrubs that have left my face very dry. I have been using this one twice a day and it has not dried my skin at all. My face feels refreshed and looks vibrant after using. The smell has a light grapefruit aroma. Very pleasant. One thing I would suggest is not using too much. A little bit really does go a long way! Very pleased with this facial scrub! I'm so glad I have had the chance to try through BzzAgent for free! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Revitalift Daily Scrub. I've been using it about a week now and I can already tell a difference. I'm using the entire line every night and my skin looks great. It really is not only brighter, but my complexion look clearer and my small bout of adult acne has disappeared. Normally trying something new makes it worse, at least at first. Not this though. I'm excited and so glad I got to try this with buzz agent. I've been telling everyone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've finally found a face scrub cleanser that I love. I really love how it scrubs well. I've tried so many other products that are a scrub but barely even exfoliate my skin. This one feels like it's really working. The smell is so great and refreshing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using this system for 20 days and my skin is loving it! My face feels cleaner, my skin looks a lot brighter and my dark spots are fading! My overall results so far are very positive, I feel it's obvious in my forehead and cheeks. It's definitely a multi-step system but worth it. I use the cleaner morning/evening, the pads at night and the night cream and day cream appropriately. I am so happy with the results and looking forward to the next 10 day mark!

"I am in love with these Loreal products. From the face wash to the moisturizers. They leave my face feeling better than it has in a long time, not to mention the smell of each product. The pads do not burn or leave my face red which is unusual. I cant thank you enough for allowing me to try these products, I am sold! PS-I am 53 years old and in the last two weeks have had a lot of compliments on my radiant skin. YAY!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Revitalize Bright Reveal Scrub has a very pleasant smell and worked to brighten up my skin, but as my face tends to be dry I used it every other day not every day. I usually do not use a scrub, because I find them to be too harsh, but this one left my face feeling soft, so the ingredients must be more gentle. Bonus-- my husband said that it made my face have a glow, so I would recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was really excited to get these products but they don't work very good on my dry skin. They have dried my face out and no brightness at all.. I have used these for two weeks but they are very drying and I have alot of other products that I would purchase for that price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this cleanser in place of my usual morning cleanser for several weeks and other than it cleaning my skin deep enough to get rid of dead skin, I didn't really notice any difference in the appearance of my skin. I will not be purchasing this product on my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to participate in this campaign. However, my results were dismal. I will start by saying I have combination skin with an oily t-zone. And, I do not tend to have much sensitivity to new products. However, within a week of starting to use the L'oreal products, per the instructions, my face was overcome with breakouts. I continued using the regimen for another week, only to have it get worse. Sadly, I had to discontinue using them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm a fan of a scrub face wash. That's generally what I use. The Revitalift scrub was good, not great. I've used it daily for the past 2 weeks. I like a little more friction with my face scrubs. It left my skin feeling thouroughly cleansed though, so I'll give 3 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the L'Oreal Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser and have noticed a real difference in the feel of my skin. It feels soft and clean but also really fresh. I like that it cleans without feeling too harsh. Some cleansers in the past that I have used have literally striped my skin of any moisture, but the Bright Reveal cleanser is really gentle.

I have been using Loreal Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for about a month this is one of the best facial daily cleanser I have ever try before my skin feels so much fresher my skin tone looks more even and smoother I also used it with other Loreal Revitalift Bright Reveal products I now have my new skin care product line that I will be definitely buying [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very concerned when I realized that the Daily Cleanser was a scrub--I have very sensitive skin and often scrubs are too harsh. However, I am pleased to reports that the cleanser has tiny particles that did not scratch or irritate my skin. My face felt fresh and not tight when I was finished.

I receive the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser free from bzzagent along with other revitalize products. I must say I love them all.

"I recently tried the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser and I really like it. I really like that I can feel the cleanser scrubbing the dead skin off my face for a brighter look. It is gentle enough to use daily. It makes my face feel so soft. The best part is that it did not cause any skin irriation. After, my sample runs out I will purchase this cleanser! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have tried other scrubs but this scrub left my face radiant and great from the first time I used it. It has no harsh perfumes it leaves you with a clean exfoliated face. I will definitely keep this product as part of my skin routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was really surprised by this product. I am very choosy about what I use on my skin, so I was somewhat worried that I would break out using this because of the change. I did get a few blemishes, but they didn't last long, and I attribute those to my sensitive skin and the change in product. I like the exfoliating grainy texture. I normally use BeautiControl and I really like the quality of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been shopping for a new skin line and haven't been impressed and then I was able to try the Revitalift line. The cleanser cleaned my face and left it so soft!!! It also removed all my makeup!

"I received the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection free from BZZ agent. One of my favorites from this collection is Revitalift Bright Daily scrub cleanser. It has brightened my face and left it feeling so soft, fresh, and amazing. I love how it takes any residue makeup off and how it feels afterwards. I want you to know how great the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection really is. Give it a try for yourself, you will not be disappointed!

This face scrub feels Very luxurious. The little particles give you a deep clean while still being gentle. The scent is also pleasant. I like that I can use it daily and it leaves my face feeling clean and soft. I have been using it once in the morning and sometimes before bed as well. It is an easy part of my skin care routine and was easy to incorporate. I would recommend this to anyone who would like to change their skincare routine to include more than just basic cleansing.

"I tried the bright reveal brightening daily scrub. It does make my face look brighter, but it hurts my face when I use it. It makes my face feel really raw and makes my face bright red. I found that I could only use it every other day on my face because my face hurt. Since I've been using it every other day my face is still will get red and raw after using it, but after a few hours the red fades and it my face does look brighter.

I am really enjoying this daily scrub. I have sensitive skin and I was afraid this would irritate my skin. I started using this in the evening and really liked the way it cleansed my skin and helped remove some dry patches. The scrub left my skin feeling clean but not stripped. I have been using this now in the morning and in the evening and I am really enjoying how this has helped me keeping my skin cleansed and balanced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This scrub cleanser worked ok as a face wash, but I never felt like I was ever getting a really deep clean like I do from a lot of other scrub cleansers. It did however leave my face feeling soft, which is a plus! I have used this product daily since I received it, so about 3-4 weeks now I think. I don't notice any changes in brightening, even skin tones, etc. I think I was expecting great results from using these products collectively. Unfortunately that was not achieved.

This L'Oréal brightening scrub is very gentle.. if you want a nonharsh exfoliater than this is the product for you.. I like it because it makes my skin feel clean and refreshed without the harshness that others have.. I would definitely use this product again ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked this scrub--it is not too harsh but still feels like it is doing a thorough job. The scent is light and clean. It contains volcanic particles which is pretty interesting and I'm glad it has a natural scrub ingredient since I read an article about the damage that synthetic micro beads are having on the ocean. It also contains gylcolic acid which I've heard good things about. The scrub was easy to use and it felt like it was working. My skin was soft and clean but not rubbed raw.

I have been using the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for about 2 1/2 weeks now and I really like the product. It is not super abrasive and it has a soft citrus smell to it. The tiny scrubby beads in the product really help to create super soft skin when you use the product. My lotion and foundation just glide on after using the cleanser. I would recommend it to others and I will purchase this product for my use in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I couldn't wait to try this once it arrived!! It is absolutely amazing. I use the cleanser in the mornings followed by the moisturizer which has spf 30 so absolutely a plus! I use the pads as well and at night I use the cleanser scrub again followed by the night time moisturizer. My skin feels amazing..the redness is I usually have has faded. I highly recommend it and will be buying more when this is gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This was my fave out of the 4 products received. The exfoliating beads are gentle yet you feel they work! And they DO! I don't care for the scent (citrus), although it's mild. It IS a refreshing scent though. I do recommend this product and very thankful I received it for free to try! I will purchase this in the future. Thank you BzzAgent and L'oreal!

"I really like this scrub as a cleanser. It is gentle on my skin, yet 'scrubby' enough to make me feel very clean and rejuvenated after using it. My skin is noticeably smoother to the touch, but I don't visibly see a difference in my complexion after using it regularly for several weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
If you're looking for a facial cleanser that doesn't dry out your skin but leaves it feeling super clean and bright this is the one. Did wonders for mine. Left my face feeling very smooth not dry or rough at all. Very happy with this product ☺ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cleanser worked great in the mornings as a gentle way to start with a clean slate and take off any excess oil and moisturizer from the night before but it did not work well to take off my makeup. If you want to use this at night you will need a makeup wipe or a separate cleanser to take off your day's makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"#GotItFree #L'OrealChallenge I am taking the 30-Day Challenge with L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection. I love this scrub because of the little beads in it.

"I love when a cleanser is also an exfoliant! It scrubs off dead skin, gets my skin super clean and doesn't make my face feel tight like a lot of other cleansers do! I also like that you can use day AND night and without drying out my skin. Another great thing about this is that you can use it as part of the whole facial ""system"" or you can use just the cleanser and it still works awesome!

"I really love this scrub! It is the perfect exfoliating face wash. My skin feels so soft and clean after using. After only a few weeks of use, I can see a big difference in the texture and tone of my skin. It makes my skin look healthier and younger .

"I waited a few weeks before I posted a review of the product. Never have tried any of the L'Oreal Revitalift products. Used daily as directed.

"I've been using the cleanser twice a day for about a month and it does a great job cleansing the skin and is not harsh.

"I have always used physical exfoliators sparingly, assuming they'd be too tough on my skin. However, Revitalift Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser has proven me wrong. I use it morning & night, massaging it into my skin very gently before rinsing off. My skin is clean & extremely soft. However, I haven't seen any brightening or evening out of my skin tone. I'll continue to use the whole line in hopes of seeing some true brightening. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that this new Revitalift Daily Scrub Cleanser is one of the best that I have ever tried! It made my skin feel soft and smooth without being tight. It is easy to use and works very well with the other components of this line. I feel like I am able to remove my daily makeup, dirt and oil completely added to the fact that I am polishing my skin as well. Loreal really hit a homerun here!

I really liked the feel of my skin after this cleaner.. My skin was so soft and after a could of weeks you could tell it had removed a lot of my dead skin.

"Well I really like this product! The first time I used this cleanser, I felt it working right away. It was soft but you felt the cleaning being done. It wasn't too harsh and didn't sting my eyes or make my skin red like some other cleansers do. I feel it was a good balance between soft and scrubby. Left my skin feeling clean and dry which was fine since I had the amazing moisturizers to put on afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using the Revitalift Bright reveal brightening daily Scrub Cleanser my face felt very clean and soft. I loved the glow that it gave to my skin. A little went a long way.

My Derm told me to only use facial scrubs once or twice a week and not near the delicate eye area. L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser makes my skin feel soft and smooth. I have been using it for 4 weeks and I like the product and intend to continue using it until I finish the container. I am very interested in seeing the end results of this scrub. It does not dry out my skin and I have been recommending this scrub to friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed the scent, it's a citrus-y one, and the texture of the scrub is perfect. And it takes a very little to later up your whole face/neck. No big chunks in here, but tiny soothing grains to polish your skin to a smooth finish. After you use this your skin is ready for moisturizing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I adore Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser! I sue it daily in the shower and it always reveals bright new skin. I simply add a small dollop to my palm and rub it in circles on my face to distribute and peel away old skin to reveal newer, younger looking skin underneath! I highly recommend this daily scrub cleanser to help fight those dreaded signs of aging. I will definitely be purchasing more of this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I feel like it is a lot like my other cleansers. I am not noticing any differences in my skin and I have been using this for two weeks. I like the texture and the feel but it isn't any better then my other cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to try the Revitalift Bright Reveal line I received free in the mail from #bzzagent however, the only thing bright about it was my face after using it. I think my skin was just too sensitive for it. I cleansed my face with the scrub cleanser followed by the moisturizer. By the time afternoon hit, it felt like my face was on fire. Unfortunately, this product didn't work well for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Being a loreal fan, I was extremely interested in the newest product, although I'm not a huge fan of all the radiant line, I will say, the scrub is simply amazing! My skin has not looked this well in a long time, and the softest is beyond anything I can describe. I will definitely be a lifetime buyer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used The Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub cleanser for the last week in my AM and PM routine. The beads did feel abrasive on my fingers and I was a little concerned because I have sensitive skin but I have not had any issues with this product. Even using twice a day the scrub cleanser has not dried out my skin and it seems it's helped even out my combination skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this for 2 weeks and see a definite difference. my blackheads are gone, and my large pores have shrunk tremendously. I could not be happier. when I run out of this product I am going to buy it again. I have already recommended it to my family and friends. I know my best friend bought some but she has only been using it for a few days. I told her in a week she would start seeing results and they only get better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First let me just start off with the fact that I have VERY sensitive skin. I liked the smell of the Revitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser, but honestly it was just too harsh for me. After 2 days my face burnt too bad, I had to give it to my sister. That being said she absolutely LOVES it. She likes the way it makes her feel. Just a warning for those with super sensitive skin. If you do not have sensitive skin the I would definitely recommend the daily scrub cleanswer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is great I have been using the product for about 2 weeks now and I can see a vast improvement in my skin. It feels cleaner and smoother then ever before. Would definitely recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm definitely starting to see results, my skin is feeling so nice and my face almost has a glow to it. And I'm not the only that has noticed either, I've had a couple friends ask me what I'm using and completely recommend it to them. I know of one that has for sure gone out and bought it, and she is loving it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the daily scrub cleanser & love how it leaves my skin feeling clean & refreshed. Pleasant smelling & super easy to use. I just wet my Hans with water & poured a little dap onto my hand & then scrubbed my face , then rinsed it off . I used it first thing in the morning & then right before going to bed. So far in loving the cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to receive this to try out but was a bit disappointed with the results so far. My skin it usually pretty clear from blemishes however I do have the occasional break out. However since using this product my skin is breaking out more then ever. I am going to continue using for a bit longer to see if it clears up, but so far I am disappointed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can not believe how great the Loreal Paris Revtialift Brightening daily scrub is! I had my doubts that the scrub would really work, but it has. Having used it for nearly a month now, I can not believe how much brighter my skin looks. It is a great step one to the whole Loreal Revitalift Brightening system. It is so gentle on my skin which is great since I have very sensitive skin. I can really feel it exfoliating and getting into my pores and clearing out all the dead skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was very excited to try the whole system. I used everything faithfully when it needed to be used for 2 weeks. My face started burning and turned red after I used the products. I had to stop, my skin is too sensitive. Back to soap and water for me. This is definitely not for people with sensitive skin or skin allergies. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I totally love this product ! I can feel it working each time I use it and it leaves my skin soft and tingly. I like the fact I can follow up with spf 30 broad spectrum and feel protected from the sun when I'm working in my garden. This product gets a thumbs up from me . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i used the revitalift bright reveal collection in the morning and evening and at first my skin felt softer but as the week went on i started to break out more and more. There is a scent to the soaps and lotions that i do not like. after i switched back to my old soap the breakouts stopped. sadly i will not be using revitalift again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
During the first week of trying this product my face broke out and I couldn't understand because I've never experience any sensitive issues. But giving an another change by using it every other day I notice a different in my skin. My skin looked balance and brighter within the second week. Towards the end of the thirty days I notice a big difference between then and now. I will continue to add the product into my routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This scrubbing cleanser was a little too harsh for my sensitive skin. I would recommend only using it once a day. Did a pretty good job at removing makeup, but didn't notice many benefits besides making my skin feel very soft. No real brightening effects to speak of. Thank you to BzzAgent for allowing me to try for free! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely loved this Cleanser from the first day I got it and and used it! It really smooths and softens my skin and I see how bright the skin underneath is after using! It makes my skin feel so smooth and my makeup goes on so much smoother now thanks to this great product and the others that go along w/it! I am definitely going to purchase this cleanser, I have combination skin and it did not irritate my skin at all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using the cleanser for about 2 weeks now and I definitely see a difference in my skin -- it feels softer and smoother. I was reticent at first as I don't like to use strong products (i.e. those with exfoliants) on my face every day but this product doesn't seem to irritate my skin. Admittedly, I don't use it day and night -- I'm just not ready to use a product with beads twice a day but we'll see. I might change my mind as the trial continues...

"I've been trying the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for over 2 weeks now. I really dislike the gritty nature of it. I've used multiple other exfoliating type cleansers, but this one is like rubbing sand on your face. While it may work good for exfoliating the skin, it is VERY hard to clean up, as the little particles of ""sand"" are not an easy feat to get off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way the Daily scrub feels on my skin. It's not too abrasive and feels great while I use it. I love the fragrance and the texture. My skin feels and looks smoother and brighter after I use it. Great product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have a love/ hate relationship with the products in the L'Oréal Revitalift brightening line, this is one I love! I really enjoyed the daily scrub! It did its job at exfoliating dead surface cells and deep cleaning makeup out of pore without being scratchy on the skin because the beads are micro and not large or ruff. My skin felt really clean after each use. I do however wish it had more of a lather to it. #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Well I'm hooked! The very first time I used this cleanser, I felt it working right away. It was soft but you felt the cleaning being done. It wasn't too harsh and didn't sting my eyes or make my skin red like some other cleansers do. I feel it was the perfect balance between soft and scrubby. Left my skin feeling clean and dry which was fine since I had the amazing moisturizers to put on afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Ok so my mom is staying at my house to help me out. My older sister lives a couple of blocks away. We planned to have a girls night. We all live in Wyoming so it's is super dry. So we decided to try the daily scrub cleaner. All three of loved it.Our ages arrange from 36 to 62. The daily scrub cleaner made all our skin so soft. I love the way it feels on our skin and the way it leaves your skin feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I thought this cleanser was good. It really cleaned cleaned my face well and got all the makeup off. I felt like it was exfoliating the dead skin, too. It didn't foam up very much, though. I would like to have seen a little more lather. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I wash my face nightly and this was better than the Apricot face wash I had been using. It didn't feel harsh to my skin and I felt really refreshed afterwards. I have recommended this to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this cleanser! The micro pearls feel very soft and not rough on my skin. It has a light lemony scent but not over powering. My skin feels nice and smooth and not dry at all.

As a BzzAgent I had the opportunity to try Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub for free. This is the first facial scrub I can use without my skin being irritated. I am so happy with this product and the results I've seen in my complexion. If you have sensitive skin like I do give this product a try. The price point is reasonable and you can find this product in just about any store. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I will start by saying that I truly loved the way my face felt after using the loreal products.. The one thing I didn't like was this gritty stuff in it. I had a really hard time getting them off my face. I would run my face hours later and still feel them...even with using the other products that came in my buzzkit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cleanser is an exfoliating face wash that makes my skin feel refreshed and smooth. After the first use I could see that my skin was brighter and smoother. By week 3 along with the use of the RevitaLift Bright Reveal peel pads and overnight moisturizer+serum my skin has been transformed from dull and blochey to fresh and flawless. Thank you Loreal for wonderful products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The daily scrub has a wonderful aroma to it and it does have a refreshing feeling after use. However, I personally do not like face washes that have a beaded texture due to my own sensory mechanisms. That is just my own personal preference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the Loreal Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub is one of the best cleansers that I have used in a very long time. My sking felt smooth after the first use and after using the cleanser for several weeks 2 times a day in combination with other Loreal Revitalift products my complexion not only appears brighter, but also looks younger with a real glow to my face. I am officially hooked on this new line of Loreal skincare. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this cleanser! It does a fantastic job cleansing and gently exfoliating my face. I have rather sensitive skin and this is gentle enough for daily use, and my face feels brighter already!

"I usually use Clinique's foaming face wash, and I still do in the morning. But this is going to be my go to evening product from now on. It really gets the day off. While you need to be careful around the eyes, wow does it really brighten up your skin while not drying it out. Plus the scrub makes your face feel extra vibrant. I can't wait to test this bad boy all winter long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for a couple of weeks I definitely notice that my skin seemed more bright and even.

"I really like using this scrub cleanser, I use it in the morning and evening. It is not abrasive some like some other cleansers I have used in the past and I have tended to shy against using since then. My face doesn't feel dried out after using. It is not scented which I like as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been looking for a great cleanser for some time now and this one did everything I needed it to. I typically scrub my face every night with a cleanser and this removes my makeup and washes my face as well as gets rid of dead skin cells. I am very happy with this scrub because my skin looks great afterward and feels really good. I love how smooth my skin is after using it. I highly recommend.

I had irritation from using all my Revitalift products at once so I decided to try them individually. I am currently using the daily scrub cleanser. It is a nice gentle scrub that I would recommend. It's not to harsh and it cleans real well. No irritation and just enough exfoliation to clean without aggravating my skin. It's my new favorite cleanser!

"I used to use the apricot pit scrub, but always felt it was to harsh. I was worried that the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser would be harsh too, but it wasn't.

I's easy to use too, just wet your face, squeeze a small amount on your hands and rub away, but not to hard. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am so excited! I just received my L'Oreal Revitalift products. I just turned forty nine and have noticed the changes to my skin that come with aging.

"I have used many products and this is the first to truly clean deep down without stripping the moisture from my skin. Just the smallest amount creates the deepest clean.

"I started with L'Oreal Paris when i was in my teens, Then i stopped and in my 20s started trying all these other products on the market. When i saw this kit i had to try it. Now in my 30s i can say i will stick to this brand. I have normal skin and it works GREAT. I have acne scars on my cheeks and i see it get lighter after 1 week of use. I will continue to use because the price is great at retailers, which for a 1 income family of 5 is definitely a +! Thanks Buzz agent for offering this brand.

I #gotitfree from #BzzAgent and L'Oreal Paris. The packaging is nice and sleek. There is a light citrus smell that doesn't linger on the skin but is nice and fresh.

Pro: Feels good on the face. Doesn't have a strong scent which most would like. Leaves face with a clean feeling. Con: doesn't foam which some might feel like it's not working. Even though it's a daily scrub it seems like I would use it a bit less. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have sensitive skin and I also get acne on my face from time to time and have acne and psoriasis on the back of my neck and upper back and shoulders into day 2 of using this product I decided to start not only using the scrub on my face, but also on the problems on the back of my neck and upper back. It is clearing up my acne, psoriasis leaving it soft and smooth! I've use prescriptions that won't do that! I am truly impressed. I have no irritation either!

The first thing I noticed about this product when i opened it was the fresh citrus like scent. I currently use a face wash with little scrubbies in it. They are hard bead like plastic that scrub my face. This face scrub was so refreshing. The scrubbies are more like fine granules of sand that makes my face feel so smooth and fresh. This product is so nice and cool. It is a great pick me up in the morning shower. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I love the brightsctub cleanser. It exfoliates my skin and cleans it all at once. It's great. My skin/face feels extra clean and refreshed. Also when I use it in the morning it makes my face look awake instead of that tired full morning look! This cleanser is wonderful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this cleanser gave my face a bright reveal. It made my face feel clean and refreshed. It made me feel great! I looked in the mirror and my face actually felt clean without the harshness or dryness to my skin. I highly recommend using this cleanser and definitely will continue to use it!!

After using Loreal Brightening daily scrub I am amazed! My skin no longer has those pesky dry patches and my skin has evened out. The best part is just hoe bright my skin looks and I feel confident enough to wear a black dress and go out on the town! I l=also used the peel before and it was an amazing duo!

"My skin is temperamental and tends towards irritation, but this has been effective in smoothing and brightening without leading to flaking or redness. For my skin, that's a high bar! I'm pleased with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My sensitive, acne prone skin is really picky about scrub cleansers. They are usually terribly harsh, leaving my face red, dry and thirsty. Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser was a really nice surprise. It is gentle enough to really be suitable for daily use and certainly leaves my skin feeling clean and fresh. My skin's positive reaction was immediate to the use of this product... I would call it love at first touch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this twice a day for a month now and so far it has been great! My skin feels smoother and more radiant after every use and leaves my skin feeling soft and clean without it feeling really dry! A big plus for me as I hate that tight dry skin feeling I get from some face washes. It has a pleasent smell and a little goes a long way. Definitely worth the price and great for any women who takes pride in her skin and wants a radiant look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was skeptical about using a face wash that didnt come from a spa or beauty store but the Revitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser was great. It did not dry out my skin making it feels tight and itchy. It was gentle but the tiny cleansing beads felt like it was exfoliating at the same time. I use it twice a day and am pleased with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this scrub! I have pretty sensitive skin and usually have extreme redness when using other scrub cleansers. L'Oreal's Bright Reveal Daily Scrub doesn't irritate my skin so no more redness! It cleans my skin without drying it out , leaving me with smooth clear skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this cleanser is the best that I've tried. I've tried cleanser that cost 10x what this cost and I didn't get these results. Vey skin feels brighter and fresher, it looks like I'm glowing. It has this tingly feel, love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was really excited to try out this new cleanser for my face. I really liked the smell, it was a wonderful way to wake up in the morning. Also the scrubbing beads were not too harsh on my sensitive skin. It left my skin and pores looking and feeling super smooth. I would definitely suggest this to anyone wanting to change up their beauty routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the cleansing scrub and I immediately noticed a difference in my skin. I would not say so much that it improved the brightness of my skin, but I definitely noticed that it helped to make my skin smoother. I could see the dead skin cells being scraped away slowly. It also did not feel like a harsh scrub against my skin, it was a very light scrub that was very light on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried this product a few times now, and I have to say I am pretty impressed. It scrubs very nicely without scratching the skin. It did well on removing residual makeup and left my face very smooth the next day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started washing my face with the scrub and not only smells good but it left my face really clean . I was concerned about my face being red afterwards but it was only because it was so clear and clean . I will keep posting next week [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This is a large skin cleanser product with glycolic acid to keep skin looking younger. The beads help exfoliate and polish the skin. I regularly use it on my hands, too, which is an often-forgotten skin area. I want them to continue to be soft and free of spots. This is a good product from a leading skin care brand--L'Oreal Revitalift. #freesample #BzzAgent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the daily scrub cleanser for a week and a half. Before I purchase this product I would like to know if I would need to purchase all the products in order to have the right results. And my answer is yes one should purchase all products to have the full effect. Since using this product I have noticed my skin look brighter and evenly toned. I believe this product will staying with me as part of my daily and night routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The Daily Scrub Cleanser was awesome I liked that my face didnt feel like if I had used sand paper and still left my face moisturized after I was done. I noticed a difference in my face even with the first use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am usually Leary of new products but so far I really love this product. I love the little microbeads so I feel like it's really getting any dry skin off and leaving my face feeling soft and rejuvenated. The smell is nice too!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I used this just a few days and my black head were gone! The stubborn blackheads on my nose were GONE!!! I was happily surprised, because I had just started using this product for only a few days.

"As a buzz agent, I received a free full tube of L'Oréal recitalist bright reveal brightening scrub cleanser. I have been using it for the last three days and twice a day. It's powerful to scrub off the dead skin cell on my skin, yet not too harsh on the facial skin. It comes with a very light lemon scent. It only needs a small pea size to work on the whole face. So far, I feel great by using it to clean my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way this daily scrub cleaner makes my face feel. I've been asked by my friends, relatives & co-workers what I've used to make my face look so much younger & I told them that I've been using L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightenting Daily Scrub Cleanser every morning before I put on my make-up. They asked how they could try some & I tell them I'm a bzzagent & that they should try it too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like the feel of this cleanser. The little scrubbing beads make me feel like my skin is really getting clean. The light citrus scent is pleasant and not overpowering. I'm liking how this leaves my skin feeling fresh. I also am pleased that a little goes a long way with this product. I use a pea-sized amount for my whole face and it foams up nicely then rinses clean. My skin feels smoother and I am noticing less redness after only one week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The gentle, yet powerful scrub was better than promised! It left my skin feeling, and looking refreshed without redness or irritation. It is effective enough to use sparingly and gentle enough to use daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this cleanser. I have dry, sensitive skin but this scrub does not irritate at all. Its got a pleasant smell and I like that you can actually feel the scrub beads cleaning. I use it in the shower at night since as the first step in the 4 step products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think L'Oréal París Revitalift Brightening Daily Cleanser is so far the best cleanser that actually worked on my skin within the first 7 days of daily use. It gently exfoliated the dullness in my skin and it brightened it to a beautiful, nourished, soft glowing touch. I will definately continue to use this cleanser daily and will add it to my skincare régimen. I recommend it to everyone who wants brand new, smooth, brightened skin, you'll love it too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far I've tried this product 4 times, and have to admit I'm in love. You have the combination of cleanser mixed with an exfoliant that's not too hard or too mild it's the perfect blend. It smells of citrus which is great because Citrus is uplifting. My skin is looking brighter and clearer injust for users. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using all 4 products consistently for about 10 days. My skin is looking better, but it is oily all the time, with more breakouts that usual. I am going to keep going for 30 days to see the full results. I am convinced this is just a process my skin is going through in the healing phase. I am going to switch to every other night on the night cream because that seems to be the product making my skin more oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had been using a facial scrub and I thought it was doing a good job, but once I tried the L'Oreal brightening daily scrub, I realized that what I was currently using, really wasn't getting my face as clean as I thought! Easy to use with enough scrub to clean but no irritate my skin. My face felt so smooth and clean and new after using this for just a couple of days! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the srub it has a nice lemon like aroma and from the very first time skin looks just clean and fresh after the use . It has been only a week but I feel the diffrence already .I would recomend to all my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This system is AMAZING! What a difference it has made in my skin! I am a person that usually doesn't believe the hype until I try something myself. Well, I am a believer and probably a lifetime user of this product. It is simply awesome! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I cannot get enough of this stuff! I am so happy that I was picked to try it because it is absolutely AMAZING! My skin feels AND LOOKS so great and smooth! I use it in the morning in the shower, and then again after taking my makeup off at night and I definitely see a major difference!!!! AWESOME! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This daily scrub made my skin feel soft and smooth in just a few days! My skin was very dull before using this. I could not believe how my skin felt afterwards. One star off because it doesn't remove makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is great I love how the little grind it feels like sand on your face and it feels like it fully at your skin while it's cleaning and gets off to all the dry skin off very easy to use I use it in the shower to clean my face it's no I must have for my everyday use product is amazing and I got it free for testing purposes only from Buzz agent and for my honest opinion for my reviews this was also my first time trying this product .

Absolutely loved the Saily Scrub Cleanser! This is a super gentle and gets the build up of dead skin to brighten up! I've been using it twice a day and my skin has turned super smooth. The scent is super fresh too. This facial scrub is great to use everyday. Great to use as the entire kit. My skin was in great need to freshen up and brighten up from removing dead skin or old pimples. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the scrub. It has a slight orange smell, which is really refreshing. The granules were the right size and felt good on my skin. It washed off easily and wasn't over drying. However, I just like a scrub when I shower and non-scrub cleanser all other times, and felt using this twice a day was a bit too much. I actually tried the whole system together. I didn't break out or notice too much oil or dryness. Unfortunately, I didn't notice a lot of brightening or change either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is by far 9ne of the best face scrubs I have tried. Theres no overpowering scent. Slight fruitiness smell. The scrub itself is thick so I didn't need a ton of it. Lathered up nicely. There's a lot of beads so no need to scrub hard. Some beads do get caught in my hairline while rinsing but it's minimal. Rinsed off easy. My face has never felt or looked smoother than after using this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Day two of using the L'Oréal Revitalift Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser and I can already feel a difference. So soft. Hoping over time I can see a big difference as well. Why haven't I used this product sooner! I have age/sun spots and redness in areas... hoping prolong use of the Revitalift products will reduce and brighten my face. Thanks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product is beyond amazing! I was skeptical but gave it a shot. Instantly my skin felt so soft and clean. I felt refreshed. I looked in the mirror not expecting to see a difference, and i did after one wash. My face was clean, and my skin was bright! for the first time in a long time the skin on my face was a even tone, and i looked wide awake not tired like i usually look. I am not a believer, fan, and a life long user [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cleanser cleans really well and does not irritate despite its scrubbing ability. The only drawback is that if it's used at the sink it takes forever to clean all the little scrubbing beads off my face and hairline, so it is best to be used in the shower before washing hair. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried a ton cleansers in my life, and I can honestly say that this is a great cleanser. It cleans and polishes, yet doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. My first impression was that it has a nice citrus smell. It's a thick gel with some serious scrubbing granules in it. I thought it might be too abrasive for sensitive skin, but I've had no issues whatsoever. My skin really appears brighter since using the whole Revitalift line! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I often look around for facial products that can not only clean the skin but aswell nourish it. I must say that I'm very impressed by the facial scrub it left my skin clean .I would recommend this product especially if your skin looks dull i feel that my face looks more vibrant and full of life! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using the complete regimen for only a couple of days and I'm satisfied with the results. Face feels smoother and even skin tone! I can't wait for more days to come So I can review again!

I think the new revitalize lift bright renewal brightening daily scrub cleanser is working amazing so far I've only used it a Few days and I'm drastically noticing the difference I had a few breakouts and two days later they were all gone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used a lot of cleansers that exfoliate and honestly most of them aren't gritty enough for my taste. The Revitalift Bright Revel Daily Scrub Cleanser is perfect and only takes a pea sized amount of cleanser to get my face clean and smooth and not tight at all. I don't use this everyday however but 2-3 times a week in the morning. I honestly plan on continuing to use this product line for quite sometime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the way this product line makes my skin looks and feel. My makeup apply on better since I have been using the L'Oreal Revitalift line. I will definitely be buying this product and recommending this to my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this product is great! I been using it for a little bit now and it makes your face so smooth and feels clean and revitalized.... I would definitely recommend this product....

"Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Face Scrub Cleanser is truly amazing! I have used it for the past 3 mornings and noticed a difference in my skin the first day.

I Started to use the Loreal revitalizing cream today and i was impressed. It does not feel greasy or leave ny skin feeling oily. The cream actually had a nice scent. Its only day one and i already feel a difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this daily scrub and use it both morning and night. It instantly makes the skin feel smooth and clean. It never irritated my skin, either. The only reason why I didn't give this a 5-star rating is because I had to also use this in conjunction with a make up remover, as I felt this was good for exfoliating the face but not necessarily for removing makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using Bright Reveal daily scrub for about 2 weeks now. It has a nice, light scent, and feels like it cleans my skin well. I'm a little apprehensive about using a glycolic scrub every day, with the fear that it might be a little harsh for my skin. So far so good though. The beads can be a little tricky to wash off your hands, and I wish it was in a pump, but all in all it seems like a solid facial scrub. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
As soon as I received this product I started using the daily scrub to wash away the daylight makeup off my face. Within a few days I noticed my skin felt so soft and my pores looked much smaller. The scrub does a very good job cleaning the make up and it eliminates the need to go back and wipe your face with toner. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this, overall is a great product. Packaging is pretty.. When you use the product, not to much comes squirting out! Skin was ok with the change for the first to weeks... Not so happy now. But I do realise that I have very sensitive skin and started slowing down to every other day using it... Looking forward to purchasing and continuing the regiment.

This scrub from L'Oréal has a very fine scrubbing texture and a nice soothing gel-like cleanser that I enjoyed using. My skin can dry out easily but this product hasn't increased my skin's dryness. It has a gentle scrub so if you enjoy a scrub with an ability to remove more junk in one swipe this may not be for you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the clean feeling without the over drying, I usually experience with other products. It smells great and lathers up nicely.I cant wait to see the difference after 30 days.This will be my daily face wash from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'oreal moisturizer products from the overnight to the brightening peel pads have increased the moisture levels in my face dramatically. Really noticed after about five days of consistent use of all four products. Not to mention I got it free from bzzagent.com. Impressed with the results I will continue to treat myself to L'Oréal Moisturizer Bright Reveal. My face even looks brighter. If you are on the market for a great Moisturizer try LOreal today.

I really enjoy using the Daily Scrub Cleanser because it is thick and coats my skin well. Tiny scrub exfoilaters get into my pores and clean very well. No irritation after or redness that I often get with other cleansers. I plan on keeping this product in my daily cleaning regimine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am in love with the daily scrub review. It has a better smell than most cleaners and actually cleans all dirt and left over make up from the day and doesn't dry your skin It leaves is brighter and smoother. I saw results after only a week of using it. I would want to know does this product work and the answer is yes. My face never looked so bright and alive and takes away small impurities [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the product. There was a noticeable softness and smoothness to my skin after use. However, I don't believe the cleansing scrub is good to use every day. Because it exfoliates my skin at times would become red and irritated sonI switched to using it every other day. I would not recommend for people with sensitive or normal skin.

"I love the clear light feel of this facial scrub, it has micro beads but isn't heavy or irritating. It also has an amazing smell and the best part is it leaves my skin feeling smoother and looking brighter.

I think this is by far the best daily cleanser that I have ever used. I like everything about it!! It really feels nice on my skin and the cleansing beads really scrub away makeup and grime in a gentle way. The smell is very pleasant and it washes off easily and leaves my skin super soft. I have been using it nightly for a week and can already see a brighter complexion. love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My day starts very early in the morning, around 2:30 am. So I use the wash then and it not only helps to wake me up, the tiny little scrubbers in the cleanser work to really freshen my skin and get it ready for the day on the farm! By the time I have cleansed my face and put on my moistureizer, I'm ready to go!! Love it. while I'm out side getting dirty, my face still feels so fresh and clean...

"I'm only on day 4 of using these wonderful products, courtesy of BzzAgent and I absolutely am in love with the results I am already seeing!

I wish I would have tried this before!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I told my family and friends that i got this L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub as part of being a BzzAgent. I told them that you get to try things before you buy them and that i told them that they should become a BzzAgent themselves. I love this cleanser it gently exfoliates dullness to brighten skin. I love the way it makes my skin feel. I will always buy this cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening daily scrub cleanser every night I only use a small amount and I can feel the exifoliation when cleaning my face. Afterwards my skin is refreshed and feels really clean. Do limit sun exposure as this product contains alpha hydroxy acid which increase your skins sensitivity to the sun. Thanks L'Oréal I will continue to use this face wash daily and buy more when needed.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cleanser is great! It has scrubbies in it to really deep cleanse in your pores. It left my skin looking fresh and bright. It left my skin with a great soft texture, and to top it off it smells great. It lathers well and rinses clean. I will be looking for more on the shelf when I'm done with my trial. When paired with the daily moisturizer, your skin will look and feel it's best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is AMAZING! I saw noticible results. Lines around my eyes are less obvious after 2 days of use. My skin feels so clean after using the cleanser. The exfoliating is not too harsh but enough were I feel like my skin is very clean. I will definitely be using this from now on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used the face wash 3 times as of today. I have tried many exfoliating face washes and I must say, I really enjoyed this one! My skin felt very soft and clean after rinsing. It has a very pleasant odor as well. I only wish it had more beads for the exfoliation, however, I suppose that is what the glycolic acid is supposed to do as well [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have been very pleased with this cleanser. It smells fabulous, a light citrus scent. It removes all my makeup and doesn't leave my skin dry or tight. I love the little exfoliators. It is mild enough to use every day and I have seen great results. I have used many expensive department store cleansers and this works just as well for much less money. I will continue to buy this when I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this scrub cleanser for about 3 weeks. I enjoy that it is lightly scented, and the scrub particles are neither too few, or too many. This gives a gentle scrub, but you still feel refreshed afterwards. I did find it a little irritating on my dry skin with daily use, but I really enjoy using it weekly before I do a mask or just for some extra exfoliation. I did not find it overly drying, it foams up nicely and rinses away clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed the facial scrub. It was gentle on my skin and I could see a difference in the texture almost immediately. It wasn't too harsh and it lathered nicely. And it rinsed away easily. It was nice to get full sized products to try for free from buzzagent and L'Oréal. It made making a decision easier when deciding what scrub to use in the future. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I LOVE this product! I was seeing results after just a day of use! I've used both Mary Kay's Timewise line and Juenesse. Neither had the fast results this has.

"I'll admit I had my doubts at first, but let me tell you this stuff is GREAT!!! It has a pleasant smell to it as well. It makes your skin feel so fresh and smooth.

I would definitely recommend this to women and men. Trust me this is worth it!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the Revitalift Brightening Scrub Cleanser by Loreal. It is a gentle scrub that is not harsh, irritating, or drying. The scrub has gently exfoliating volcanic particle beads that refine the texture of my skin. It has a pleasant light citrus scent too! It has helped refine my pores and made my skin a touch brighter! I would recommend this product even if you have very sensitive skin...it does not disappoint! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After just one week I feel smoothl radiant skin. MY cheeks glow with new skin and it breath the air feels so nice on my cheeks.

I am left with a clean and fresh face . This is an excellent product #gotitfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Just too scrubby. Maybe if I were a coal miner, or something. I'm usually very anti-microbeads, but these are made from the natural mineral perlite, not plastic. So they won't contribute to the Great Pacific Garbage Gyre. This cleanser, like the other products in this line, smell nice, but not perfumey. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It is amazing! 'My skin is brighter and so soft! My dull, tired, little time for me mom face now glows. The old acne scars are fading. My skin is very sensitive and this did not give me a painful dry or burning skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It is true that everyday use of this product will smoothen your face. Question is for how long. After the age of 30 the skin is starting to get thinner. Scrubbing the outer layers of it makes skin more prone to wrinkles and much more sensitive to sun. I use it 2-3 a week and I would not recommend more than that.

"I think this loreal product is going to be my new product for good. My skin is clearing up, the Melasma i have (dark marks) is becoming more and more lighter. So glad i tried this, this is my new routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loved the scrub cleaner for the face. It was awesome to use. My face feels so soft after each use. This scrub is not to rough for the face. I have been using it twice a day. I'm not a fan of the moisturizers. They leave my face feeling to heavy and the pores clogged. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The scrub cleanser is amazing!! It's gentle enough to use every day and leaves my skin feeling super smooth and soft. Too harsh for the eyes though, I need a separate makeup remover. Perfect prep for the peel pads and following moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like this alright. Leaves my face feeling clean. I don't really see any difference with the brightness of my skin and doesn't seem any smoother. I don't think I would buy this on my own again. I'll stick with my cheaper face cleaner which gives me the same results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I Loved the gentle exfoliation of the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub. It made my skin feel fresh and clean. Having sensitive skin it is hard to find a product line that supports the balance between oily and dry and this one was the perfect combination. I will definitely add this product to my daily skin care regiment!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i think this product is awesome! makes my face feel fresh and clean without stripping the natural oils, but takes off dead skin. the beads are mild in this scrub and feel great. i do wish it would foam a little more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is just way too scrubby for me. And I'm very against the use of microbeads BUT! I discovered that these microbeadsare made from perlite NOT environment-harming plastics, so that's good. It smells nice, though; not perfumey. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. It made my skin smoother and softer right away. With the weather changing I didn't have any issues with breakouts, too dry, to oily. This is a product that I will use in the future and tell all about. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser that I received complimentary in a set from #BzzAgent has worked on expoliating my face wonderfully. After a couple weeks I have seen a difference worth talking about. The smell off the product is very light, the beads wipe off easily and it has this 46 year old skin feeling smooth, fresh and fabulous. What I love about it is it only takes a drop and it is not drying at all. #GotitFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for a few weeks now and it makes my skin look and feel amazing. It smells great too.

I'm very impressed with this and really recommend it to anyone who is looking for a cleanser that actually brightens the skin and helps with fine lines and wrinkles. #gotitforfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"More than excited about the Revitalift 30-Day Challenge. I started by using the Revitalift Bright reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. My skin feels not only so clean, but soft and smooth. For anyone who may have used another product for years, I am you. While gently scrubbing the skin, this product really does leave my skin looking brighter, more even, and clean. We have a winner! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am so excited to tell you about this product. It feel so good on the face. You can feel it working while it is on your face sloughing away all the dead skin cells. My husband even commented on how soft and smooth my face feels! I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This stuff is AWESOME!!! I have been looking for a cleanser that exfoliates, but is gentle enough to use everyday and I finally found one. This cleanser not only get your face clean, but its a deeper clean than with other cleansers. The exfoliant is gentle and it buffs and polishes at the same time to leave your skin smooth and glowing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the entire line for about 3 weeks now, I love all of them and how they make my skin feel so clean. I have had to discontinue use of the cleanser as it started breaking mine and my husbands face out. I have went back to my Loreal cleanser but continued the remaining line. I love it, I have notice my lines under my eyes being less noticeable and my skin is very much brighter. Will post before and after 30 days of use photos soon!

"I've been using this scrub everyday for a few weeks now and I really do love it, when I run out I will definitely be purchasing more.

"After using the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for over a week, I'm a little disappointed. At first, it was great at getting rid of all the dry, dead skin on my face. But now it seems the more I use the cleanser, the drier my skin gets. I'm not sure if it's my skin becoming chronically dry, or if it's the Revitalift system making my skin drier. Overall, I give it 3 stars because as long as I keep using the system daily, my skin will be free of flakes! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this cleanser. It is a thorough, yet gentle exfoliating cleanser. Does not leave my skin dry or tight. I noticed an immediate difference! I will definitely keep this in my skincare lineup! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is the only thing I will use to clean my face now. The tiny beads scrubbing my skin are gentle and yet they feel so good as they get rid of dead skin cells and leave my face glowing without ever drying it out.

This product like the rest in this grouping are just to harsh for my skin personally..I wouldn't recommend it to people with fair or sensitive skin..it just seems to abrasive and makes my skin burn and makes it bright red. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is good at smoothing out your skin and making you feel refreshed the scrub can feel a bit abrasive but with a good scrub but it surely does the trick. All in all I would buy this again to brighten my complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was a little hesitant to try anything different on my skin. My skin can be very sensitive and anything new usually causes a breakout. I have been using the Daily Scrub Cleanser for about 2 weeks and I really like it! After using it it makes my skin look shiny and new instead of dull. The smell is very light and pleasant. If it continues to work as well as it does now I will continue to use this product. I just wish it wasn't quite so expensive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser and it has made my face so soft and smooth. I can't stop touching my face. I have sensitive skin and I haven't had any issues with any of these products. I love the way they smell too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Great scent. A little bit goes a long way. Rinses clean. Leaves skin feeling smooth and refreshed. My skin did experience a breakout after using all 4 products. Not sure if it's related to 1, all or none. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first step in this Revitalift process is the scrub. Tiny beads and a great lather work together to make your face clean. The beads are like granules of sand and are not too abrasive. Even the smell is pleasant during this process. I felt a smoother, cleaner face immediately; even after the first initial wash. Easy to apply and remove.

"This is definitely a product that I will continue to use in my skin care regimen. I noticed the first time that I used it, my skin was softer... and over a few weeks it became brighter and had less blemishes even!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm really enjoying the scent and feel of the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. I've been using it in the morning and evening as part of my skincare routine. My skin feels clean. I will say I am noticing a small patch in my nose that feels like a pimple may be trying to surface, but I'm continuing to test this product.

"Since I found out I was receiving this kit, I was most interested in the scrub, and it did NOT disappoint.

Loreal Revitalift Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is a clear colored gel with tiny micro beads. It has an invigorating citrus smell. It is not made for multiple skin types.

I think l'Oreal daily scrub cleanser works gently on skin and cleans very well. Very nice exfoliation of face I really liked it. These l'oreal revitalift products all goes together and seems step by step process to rejuvenate and exfoliate for better results. When i use as instructed on the back of the products I assume i will see better results while using everyday.

"I really do love the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub. It makes my face feel so fresh. It's like my face is happier. I wash my face each morning and night. This scrub rejuvinates my skin, all the while making it feel more firm and yet still soft to the touch. Definitely would recommend it. #gotitfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The scrub was free and I have so far enjoyed using it and so does my face. It has a nice simple, subtle scent of citrus and it has a gentle scrub to it. I do not have to use but just a pea size amount and it lathere and spreads all over my face and neck. My face does feel smooth and does have a slight glow to it afterwards. I will continue to use it to see hopefully further improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was curious whether or not it was going to make my skin feel dry and dull. I have tried other products in the past and my skin was still very dry looking . I was wondering if it was going to be a harsh exfoliates or a gentle exfoliating on my skin . I am looking for something that would even my skin tone as well as reduce the wrinkles .

"I was currently using L'Oreal's Overnight and Day Revitalift Cream before I received this scrub as a promotion to try and I love it. Leaves my skin so soft, clean and bright. I will definitely continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried oh too many cleaners in my 38 years and so when this one came, I was excited to try but thinking it might irritate my skin. I put a little water on my fingers, put the cleanser on and rubbed on my skin. After washing my skin, I was amazed how smooth it was! And no redness either!!! I have spent so much money on other lines and I am thrilled to have found a skin care line that will not break the bank! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVED the feel of this scrub right away. It feels so very gentle when I use it, but it really made my skin look less dull and was a definite improvement right away. I can't wait to see the results in a few weeks. I really liked that there was no strong fragrance either. It was easy to use and rinsed off easily, leaving my skin feeling soft and not greasy. I then used the peel pads and night moisturizer. I have a feeling I'll be buying everything once I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Started using this the day I got it. The cleaner works well and I always use the pads before bed and before I put the night time cream on. You only need a little. In the morning I use the day time cream. I had a large laugh line on my forehead and these products has made it less noticeable. Love this!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product worked well. It seemed to get the dirt and oils off my face. It left my skin a a little drying when used alone and not with a moisturizer. I have not had an issue with acne for years, but I was using with and the whole set as directed and started breaking out with a mild case of acne. I'm not sure which product it was from or if it was a combination of them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The brightening daily scrub cleanser. This product feels so good. The micro-pearls feel so good on my face it feels like it really is cleaning my face.

"I think the L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub is a phenomenal product. I have only used the product a total of 3 days and my skin looks and feels incredibly soft and smooth. Simply can not wait to see more results in a few weeks! Love this daily scrub, hands down it is better than a name brand scrub I have been using. L'Oréal is my new fave daily scrub!

"I use cleanser 2x a day in the morning and evening. I need a cleanser that is gentle, yet effective. L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Cleanser works perfectly for me. It cleans my skin without leaving it dry or tight. It is gentle enough to use twice a day. In the evening it easily removed my make up. My face was left clean, but not red. I have combination skin and in worked well both on my cheeks and t-zone. I would highly recommend this product for all different skin types. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I consider myself an exfoliation expert. I do love this exfoliation in this product. It left my face feeling clean and smooth. The exfoliant in this product is heavy enough to feel like it's doing something. I did still use my regular face wash after this one however because I can't clean around my eye makeup with an exfoliation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I absolutely love Loreal Paris Revitalift system. I have been using revitalift for two weeks. My skin feels firmer and brighter. My Wrinkles seem finer. Revitalift is so easy to use.

I love it.#Igotitfree #L'Oréalparisrevitalift #bzzAgent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Revel Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for about two weeks. I can honestly say I love this cleanser. It truly leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth. It doesn't have an overpowering scent and has nice tiny but mighty scrubbing beads. I have tried tons of cleansers and this is by far one of my favorites. I have noticed a difference in the texture of my skin and can't wait to see the difference it continues to make! Thanks L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So far I like that the scrub isn't too brittle or harsh. You can tell it is exfoliating but not so rough that it will tear fragile skin. My skin feels soft after using it. And I appreciate that it doesn't have any strong scent, which can be irritating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is amazing in the mornings! I'm 35 years old and very picky about ingredients in products. There's excellent ingredients,i can already see results in just 3 weeks!

I think the Revitalift cleanser makes my face especially clean . The little beads seem to exfoliate my skin and leave it smooth without being overly harsh.

Just received my bzz kit yesterday. I used the Daily scrub cleanser. I do feel like it thoroughly cleansed my face. I also thought it had a pleasant fragrance. I feel many facial cleansers have too strong of a fragrance. This was not to strong but still very nice. I used the peel pads after the cleanser. I did feel like they irritated my skin slightly but hopefully I am able to get used to it. I am excited to see if this product produces results!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this since I received it which was four days ago, after the first morning after using it my right eye lid is broken out, its terrible with swelling. Not sure if one of the creams got onto my eyelid while sleeping. I am going to keep trying it out and making sure not to get any of the products near the breakout. To early to tell if its working on the rest of my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love these products. I jave been using them for 2 weeks and ny skin feels so soft after using them. I can't wait until it has been a full eight weeks so that I can report back with more results. I have being using all four products everyday now for fourteen days and my skin feels very moisturized and full. It seems like it has a simple glow to it right now ans seems to even out my dull skin.

"First of all it only takes a tiny amount of this cleanser so the bottle should last a while. The scent is absolutely amazing!! My nose was in heaven!! It's not greasy, thick, or hard to work with. I will be replacing my current cleanser with this. This is my 4th day using it and I couldn't be more pleased!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very sensitive skin, so when I saw that this cleanser was a scrub, I was very hesitant to try it. The directions say to rub together with wet hands and then apply to face. The scrubbing crystals are very large so I made sure that I rubbed most of the crystals into my hands first before applying to my face. This does have a strong fragrance, but after using this cleanser in the evening and morning, it was smoother and more radiant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like the scrub...I have used it for a week now, and it has really helped to get rid of all the dry, and dead skin off of my face and neck! It leaves my face soft, fresh, and clean feeling!

I have never tried any L' Oreal product so this is new to me. When I tried the Daily Scrub the first thing that I realized was that I loved the scent and when I started rubbing it on my face I felt a little tingle and even at that my face had looked shiny and I was really impressed by the scrub. I have never used a scrub before but I have to say that it really made my skin brighter and shinier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This stuff really takes off anything that makes my face flaky! My skin is getting smooth and bright with every use (I'm using at morning and at night). I was expecting some tingling or something like because of the glycolic acid (and my sensitive skin), but until now, nothing (its been a week since I started using) Makes put on foundation a breeze! ;) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I loved how it slid around easily on my skin but the small beads were scrubbing away. It left my face feeling refreshed and clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love this scrub. The scrub has the perfect amount of micro beads. It has a nice soapy texture as well. I have to have that soapy quality in any face cleanser to feel clean. This scrub goes a long way. You need less than a pea sized amount and it spreads and covers your entire face and neck. My skin feels clean and refreshed after use. I'm loving it!

"I have never really used a cleaner regularly on my face so trying the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser was a little out of my comfort zone. After using it day and night for 3 days, I love it. My skin was immediately softer after using the first night. I couldn't believe how soft my skin felt. This is definitely a product that I will be using again and again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I'm only two days into my 30 Day Challenge and I already love this scrub cleanser! It's gentle enough to use every day, twice a day, but it helps to slough off all that rough & dead skin.

My skin is very sensitive and often turns bright red in reaction to cleansers and chemicals, but I've not had any problems like that with Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser.

I am on month two of using the RevitaLift Bright Reveal line. This cleanser is an exfoliating face wash that makes my skin feel refreshed and smooth. After the first use I could see that my skin was brighter and smoother. By week 3 along with the use of the RevitaLift Bright Reveal peel pads and overnight moisturizer+serum my skin has been transformed from dull and blochey to fresh and flawless.
Oh my goodness words can't even egin r explian how I feel about the brightening scrub. The.little.beads make your skin feel so smooth.

I was very excited to try this face scrub due to sun spots that I have on my face. I'm hoping that the glycolic acid helps fade them a bit. The scent of this cleanser was wonderful. I smelled like oranges. And it had a silky feel with a mild scrubbing effect. I can't wait to see how it changes my skin after a few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have VERY sensitive skin. I read the instructions and began at night before bed. I cleansed, I felt it kind of burning so I rinsed. Then used the pads. . I felt the same burning. I wiped my face with clean wet cloth and then applied the moisturizer. I still felt slight burning, which calmed within minutes. The moisturizer really made my face feel soft. I tried again the next night the burning continued to I discontinued use. I don't recommend for those with sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this daily scrub cleanser is awesome, I have very uneven skin tone and had blotches on my face, I have been using the scrub daily for a week now and have noticed the blotches fading and my skin is looking great.

"I think the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is a great daily cleanser. It feels a little gritty, but I think that helps with the cleaning, because after I rinsed it off, I noticed a difference in my skin immediately.

"The scent of products is a huge factor for me. Fortunately L'Oreal has figured out to give a cleaning product a very simple clean scent. My husband even mentioned how it smelled ""nice"" and not like most products. I was also very happy with the feel of my skin after washing. I'm pregnant and the hormones have made my skin dry and a bit flaky so it was awesome to be smooth and fresh again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only been using Loreal Revitalift Reveal Brightening Scrub Cleanser for a few days but i love it! I usually use an apricot scrub to get rid of dead skin and for my face to be smooth , this scrub had some sorta scrubbing crystals in it that work just like that. I look forward to using this til its gone!#Brightening! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just recieved this today. and got started right away! I love the fact that is does not require a large amount to clean the face. It felt like tiny grains of sand scrubbing my face. Easy to read instructions, and I love the way my skin felt after I washed it off. And that there was no trace of make up left on my face!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product, but, it is a little too harsh for me to use everyday. I will use it 3 times a week. It is very deep cleaning and my face felt soft and ready for my moisturizer. The smell is wonderful and the texture is great. I am very impressed by this product and will buy it again!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

So far, first morning the small white bumps I consistently have on my cheeks are non-existent. Still red but I already see one small change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"So far I've only used this once but my skin feels amazing! These brightening Revitalift products are perfect for me to try. I have dark spots on my face from sun damage and I have tried multiple products to try and fade them including; Rodan & Fields, Murads, and prescription cream. Nothing has impressed me so I'm very excited for this affordable product, I am taking before and after photos so I can't wait to see if there is a difference.

"I just received my kit in the mail and I am already in love. I tried it for the first time this evening and I was pleasantly surprised at the pleasing smell, almost like an orange.

I can't wait to see how my skin looks in a couple of weeks! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this is the best facial cleanser I have ever used my face felt so fresh and clean I would recommend L'ore'al revivalist bright reveal to all of my friends and family.

"I used the Scrub Cleanser according to the directions. I noticed after the first day that my skin felt smoother. It was a little hard to wash off though with just water, so I will start using this in the shower for easier clean up. I will let you know more about my skin tone and brightness once I have used for a time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received L'Oréal Revitalize just a few days ago. One word, Amazing! I had noticeably smoother skin just after one use of the scrub and daily moisturizer. I love how refreshed my skin feels after using L'Oréal Revitalift. With a light fragrance and no oily residue. I highly recommend these products, especially if you want healthy glowing skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just love this face cleanser. The smell is grea, reminds me of lemongrass. The product really cleans my face and doesn't leave a greasy after feel. I love the little scrubbers and even though I have only been using this product for a few days in the morning my face is definitely brighter and smoother.

"This product left my skin so soft and silky! I was skeptical about it, but it actually worked well. It also was easy and quick. I was worried that a multi step, multi product would be time consuming. I was wrong... it was quick and easy. The product left my sensitive skin, not irritated, red , or blotchy. It is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I was so excited to try this product as the whole line sounds like it offers great anti-aging and skin-reviving benefits. Unfortunately, my sensitive skin flared up right away. I gave it a few uses, though, just to be sure, but my skin became dry, itchy, irritated, and red. I am sure that this product has some great beautifying effects, but it is not ideal for sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As much as I love majority of Loreal products I am very excited to try this line of products. As I have mature, aging skin. My skin has lost its luster. I am looking forward to a glowing rejuvenated completion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I've been using the Loreal revitalift bright reveal for a few weeks now. As a person who has always had sensitive skin, I was leary to start using it. Thankfully I didn't have a reaction, and actually I have never seen or felt my face Luke this before. My skin is smoother, softer and brighter. I love using these products daily, and I will purchase in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am so impressed with this cleanser. I have been using it morning and night for just over two weeks and my skin feels healthy and seems noticeably brighter. The cleanser seems gentle and I have not had any issues whatsoever with sensitivity or irritation. Just a little bit goes a long way and works into a nice lather. The smell is light, maybe a little citrusy, but not overpowering at all. Just a clean fresh scent. I'm sold! I think it's a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I saw that this product contained glycolic acid and was a scrub, I was a little worried. Surprisingly though this combination makes my skin feel clean not tight. After a week of religiously using the entire line my skin looks brighter, less congested and that pesky dark spot on my cheek is lighter. Can't wait to see what it looks like after four weeks.

I liked this face wash for using in the mornings because it gets rid of oil accumulated while sleeping and also exfoliates my skin making it ready for putting on makeup. It really feels refreshed and clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This skin care regimen is one of the best I have tried, by far. From the first time I used the products, I could feel and see the difference. My skin felt firmer, tighter, brighter and refreshed. My favorite part of this routine is the cleanser. It preps the skin for better absorption and more radiance. I highly recommend this skin care regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal is a wonderful skincare product line. The cleanser and brightening peeling pads prepare my skin for the luxurious moisturizer. These products have evened out my skin tone and left me with a more luminous and glowing complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although, I really like this scrub I have to admit I have a hard time getting used to adding it to my skin care routine. I love it when I remember to use it .(which is several times a week) I love the way it makes my skin feel! The only complaint I have is that I can never seem to get all the exfoliating beads off. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this cleanser for a week now, and I really like it. After use, my skin feels very clean, but there is no over drying of the skin. I haven't been using it long enough to get the full effects of the cleanser, or the whole skin care system, but I'm feeling pretty positive that I will get great results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This microderma abrasion cleanser is great! It left my skin feeling soft and totally clean! It smells great too. I'm always hesitant to try new cleansers but this one definitely ranks high on my chart. I feel that it cleans perfectly without leaving my skin feeling stripped or dry. It's great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the scrub. I have tried it nearly every day now and think it works fine. I really like the space age packaging, too. I think everyone should try it. I even saw it in the newest November issue of Redbook which was exciting. The scrub is great to use in the shower, I found it in fact, the best place to use it since it can take a few washings of water to get the scrub entirely off. I think I will use this scrub as much as possible. It even seemed fine to use with my rosacea. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I just began using the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection! Today was the first day...and this morning I used both the Daily Scrub Cleanser and Moisturizer.

I foresee the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection becoming part of my daily routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Gentle on face and able to use morning and night, but still able to exfoliate really well. Leaves my face really clean and soft feeling. Doesn't quite lather easily enough for ne which is why I have four rather than five stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far I've been using the whole routine each day and night. The products have a great scent but the products leave my skin feeling oily. The biggest drawback for me is after a few days, I start getting in grown hairs. Certain products do this and I'm not sure what ingredients cause this. I love the line but I have to avoid any sites that the facial hairs grow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"There is a lot that I love about this product! It does an amazing job at cleaning my skin and removing dirt, oil and makeup. The exfoliating cleansing particles leave my skin feeling really clean, fresh and smooth. I'm nearing 40 and my skin has never looked so good. I was afraid of breakouts as I've gotten trying new products sometimes but I never experienced this and actually my breakouts have improved. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using the revitalift brightening daily scrub for about a week now and I love it . It's very gentle and has a lovely citrusy sent .

"A lot of the exfoliating cleansers I have used are so rough that I do not use them again. That isn't the case with this. It smells great, cleans beautifully and doesn't leave my skin feeling raw.

"Loving the little scrubbing beads. This product leaves my skin super soft and feeling super clean. LOVING the fact that a little goes a long way with this Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser.

"After 2 weeks of using Loreal Paris Revitalift my skin looks and feels soft,fresh and younger! it doesn't dry out your skin and no oily residues.I used the face scrub every morning and evening before bed, I will definitely keep the Loreal Paris Revitalift as my skin care regimen and highly recommend it. I received this product free from Bzzagent for review purposes and in return I give my own honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this daily scrub for about a week now and I really like it. You can feel it working cleaning and exfoliating your face as your skin tingles when you wash with it. I have red patches in different parts of my face and the discoloration is diminishing as I use this product. My skin feels clean and looks refreshed and more even-looking. I will continue to use this product. #GotItFree #BzzAgent #L'oreal Paris [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like this scrub for a manual exfoliation, but find the little granules seem to get everywhere, up my nose in my eyes. I'm careful but struggle with that. Lol. I have only used it for the past week and I do notice my skin is brighter and less dull. I have had a few breakouts but that could be because it is new a purging some of the gunk in my pores. I will continue to use and see where my skin ends up!! The fragrance is light and citrusy which is enjoyable as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"2 weeks in on the 30 Day Challenge. Loving the results thus far! My skin looks and feels brighter. Using these 4 products together gives amazing results! They use glycolic acid, vitamin c, and pro-retinol in their skincare products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am so in love with this reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleaner. I use it once in the morning and once in the evening. I was doubtful at first of it really working but you have to really stick to it as a daily routine. I get an amazing feeling when using it. You do get a tingly feeling on your face but to me that means its working. I highly recommend this especially with the rest of the products in the kit, you will surely see a difference in your face.

"I've been using this product for exactly one week. I have to say I do like the scent, but I think the fine micro scrubbies in the cleanser could be more because the product doesn't feel like it is doing the job, even though my face feels smooth and fresh. I really haven't noticed much difference, but then again, I never had a problem with my skin. (thank goodness) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this product.I have been using it for about a week now and my skin feels great. This scrub smells great. Doesn't have a strong scent and has little micro beads that help exfoliate and cleanse my skin.

Great job! #loreal#bzzagent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tend to have sensitive skin so I'm always a little cautious trying something new. I've now only used this product twice, but am loving the results so far. Many facial cleansers leave my skin feeling dry, itchy and even burning. Revitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser has left my skin feeling clean, soft and smooth after each use. I'm looking forward to seeing the results after using this product further. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I was super excited to try this product and unfortunalty I was not happy with it when I did try it. It really made my face burn so I did not keep trying it. I gave it to my husband to try also and he said the same thing. Unfortunately I'm not willing to keep trying something that hurts my face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recently received my Loreal Revitalift Bright Daily Scrub and lets just say I LOVE it! I really love the way it has tiny course beads to scrub my skin.

"I have tried all the revitalift bright reveal brightening products and I have to say I absolutely love them all, my skin is prone to blemishes so I was skeptical on using this product. I have had no breakouts and must say that I'm 42 but my skin doesn't look a day over 30. This is the best product I have tried in many years and must say I have found my new skin regiment for morning and night....Very very happy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this cleanser , I think it makes good on its claims, it's gentle and it brightens as it cleans off makeup extremely well . It's lightly scented . My face feels soft , clean but not dried out. I haven't used it for a full 30 days , but I have used it for at least 2 weeks , so far so good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used it for the first time today and I liked the smell and the grittiness. Made my skin feel good but wasn't an amazing difference because I exfoliate a couple times a week anyway. I would not use this everyday as a cleanser but maybe a couple times a week as an exfoliator. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is something I will continue to buy. I love how my skin feel soft immediately after I get out of the shower and I'm noticing a difference in my skin tone and texture. It also has a very pleasant smell. It's gentle enough that my skin doesn't feel raw but you can feel it scrubbing away the dead skin. The lather it makes is very silky also. I very much believe that after a week of use my skin looks fresher and brighter! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser in the mornings to wash my face before I moisturize and put on makeup. It lathers well with only a small amount and leaved my skin feeling clean and fresh. I only gave it a 4/5 stars because I can't use it every day. The little exfoliating beads feel great, but would irritate my skin if I used daily. I use about 3 times a week and it's great! #gotitfreefromBzzAgent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have tried many facial scrubs some where to abrasive and some I just felt didn't clean well. So far I have used the new L'OREAL Revitalift Bright Reveal cleanser for 2 days morning and night and I'm really enjoying it. It's a very light gel with fine scrub texture. After using my face felt and looked clean and fresh and not at all drying. I will continue using this to see if it does improve the brightness and tone of my skin, but so far I'm loving this new L'OREAL facial scrub. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product with the rest of the collection. I felt like it was a good scrub and cleanser, but it can be somewhat irritating. I don't have very sensitive skin, but I could definitely feel it stinging my skin after washing. For people with sensitive skin, this might not be the right product for them.

"I have a hard time finding a good scrub for my face. I try to avoid scrubs with harsh pieces in them that might scrap my skin, but I also want one that actually works.

I've only been using it for a few days, but my skin tone already looks better, and my skin feels better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

So far I love this product! In fact I will be replacing my regular cleanser with this one. It makes you fee smooth and clean. I've always used an exfoliating cleanser but this is the first time I have felt I didn't need to used a scrubbing cloth as well. Not only does it feel good it smells good. It's light aroma is fruity and pleasant. It's a great way to prepare your skin for moisturizer and makeup! #gotitfree #bzzagent #loreal #revitaliftbrightreveal [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I usually choose a wipes to clean my face but I am enjoying using this cleanser i received being a Bzz agent.

"First off I love the packaging of this product it looks higher end and very modern. The actual product though is not for me. I am not loving the scrub aspect and feel that it may be a little harsh for my skin. On the other hand my sister came over one day and used it and she loved it. It is a great cleanser if you don't mind a little extra scrubbing power, but I prefer a smooth cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using the Daily Scrub Cleanser for a week there is a noticeable difference in my skin. Once a day use is all it takes. Not only is my skin softer but I also feel like my makeup has a smoother feel and appearance. The scrub has been effective in removing dead skin which is essential to a healthy glow. The Daily Scrub Cleaners will become a staple in my home! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I was so excited to try the new L'Oréal recitalist bright reveal I started using it on day one. After the first facial scrub I knew this was going to be a great experience. My skin felt smoother immediately after. I am only on week two and can already tell a difference in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've just started using the L'Oreal Bright Reveal Collection and after the very first use of the cleanser I'm hooked! My skin felt smoother and softer than I can ever remember it feeling before. It's not harsh on the skin and it leaves your skin feeling clean and refreshed as well. Can't wait to see the longer term results as I have some issues with uneven skin tone. I'll be updating this with pictures as I go along for the 30 day challenge. Today is day 1. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very excited to try the L'Oréal Bright Reveal Scrub. I have been using it every night for a week and a half. I am enjoying the fresh lemony smell. It is a nice light scrub on my face. Afterwards my skin feels a little tighter, clean and refreshed. It also feels soft and smooth. I really love this product. I have always been a fan of L'Oréal skin care. This is another hit for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this cleanser. It's gentle, but it cleans well and it has a very light, pleasant citrus-y scent that I really enjoyed. I felt like my skin was clean afterward without being dry. I feel like my face is super smooth and it feels like velvet when I touch it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is excellent! I had a horrible reaction to a different anti-aging skincare line. I am so grateful that I was able to try this for free AND have the courage to use it! I'm 37-years old with combination skin and an occasional blemish and just after a few days of using the system, my skin is balanced and beautiful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was so excited to try ReVitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser. After 4 days of using the cleanser the left side of my face, particularly my nose, broke out in blisters that ended up looking like burn marks. I was horrified. I don't have sensitive skin so I am not sure why this happened. This was my first time using L'Oreal skincare products. I recieved my L'Oreal ReVitalift Daily Scrub from BzzAgent so at least, I did not lose any cash! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My face felt new and refreshed! It was so smooth and I felt so good after I used this scrub! I felt like every bit of dirt that was ever on my face has come up. It was like someone let me start all over again with with a whole new face I loved it! I would definitely recommend this product to someone else [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When I received this product in my BZZKIT I was a little hesitated about trying this cleanser but after using it I think this cleanser is great. Every time after using this my cleanser my skin is so soft and feels really cleaned and brighter and it hasn't irritated or dried out my skin which I'm truly happy about. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using the daily scrub for only one week, my skin feels amazing! I have noticed smoother, softer and yes, even brighter, skin. If you get a chance to try this L'Oreal line you definitely should. Really can't wait to see what the next couple of weeks reveal. This has become a staple in my beauty tool box!!

"This new line of products from LOreal is great. The scrub has a great texture, it's not too gritty and didn't irritate my skin like others I have tried. My skin felt so smooth and soft after the first time and the more I use it the softer my skin feels. I don't have the flakiness like I did before. I can't wait to see how my skin looks and feels after 30 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just started using the Revitalift Daily Scrub and I love it. It gentle enough to use on a daily basis and it doesn't irritate my skin. I also love that my skin feels moisturized after washing with this and doesn't feel dry or tight. Overall, I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It felt cold a gritty on my skin, was easy to use and remove, a little goes a long way! It helped to soften my dull dry skin, left it healthy looking and fresh. I would recommend this to family and friends! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the scrub that came with the kit. I was worried that my skin would be red after using it but it wasn't. I do use very little pressure when applying it to my face. Once you rinse you are left with your skin feeling super clean, and ready for the next step. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this new Loreal line is a great thing for all faces!! At first I was unsure because I did have a few breakouts appear and was less than thrilled but, think that was just proof of how deep the clean really is. But the after effect feel of smooth clean skin from the scrubbers is wonderful. I hope when this product is released in stores it is a reasonable price so, that I can continue using.

"If you haven't tried Revitalift Brightening scrub , you are missing out ! My skin is so soft and it glows . I have been using this product for 2 weeks now . It has replaced my more expensive products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"At first I was a bit sceptical about how good L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser was going to work. And a little goes a long way. So immediately the first time I ised it, I noticed a difference at how much cleaner and brighter my face looked. I've tried so many facial cleansers and by far never had one giving me results like this! It doesn't dry my skin out after using it even 2x a day. Im definitly going to keep using this with my skin care regimen! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is WONDERFUL. I have found some cleansers that do not dissolve your daily makeup BUT this one DOES!!!! So I do not need to have yet another product. The exfoliating beads are soft enough for daily use but strong enough to get the job done without drying out your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Its only been my 4th day using the cleanser but i must say the small scrubbers make it strong enough to remove any dead skin but gentle enough not to rub your face off. So far I am loving the product cant wait to finish my 30 day challenge and see it do its work! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am really impressed with how this product actually brightens and evens out my skin tone! I have only used this for a week and I can't believe I'm seeing results already! I am so excited to see what my face looks like in 30 days! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the daily scrub cleanser is phenomenal. It is one of the best scrubs I have ever used. It is perfect to use right when you wake up in the morning. I feel like my skin is clean and clear as soon as I rinse it away. There is no film or residue on my face after I wash it. I truly feel like this scrub removes all of the dirt and acne that builds up on my face in the middle of the night. You can count on this scrub to keep your face fresh and glowing all day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is a wonderful cleanser with a slight smell of orange. I have oily sensitive skin with many dark areas. This product has not made me break out. It leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth. Too early to tell if it will work on the darkness but does feel it's shedding the dead skin off for cell turn over. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've only used this cleanser for 5 days, but so far, I like it. The small beads in the cleanser makes me realize how the scrub is exfoliating my skin. It also soaps up a bit which I also enjoy because it again makes me feel like it's cleaning. I've used the scrub the past few evenings in the shower and appreciate how it completely removes the make up I'm wearing, even mascara! So far, I am very pleased with the quality of this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cleanser is very smooth to apply. It lathers well and leaves face feeling soft and smooth. I do not have a sense of smell right now so I cant comment on that. I did not notice an immediate result on my face looking brighter or more even tone but Im hopeful with a few washes I will. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Loving the Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser! My face feels amazing after just one use. My skin feels toned and refreshed and my pores are tight. I was amazed that for the first time ever my face was not over dry after using a cleanser. Will definitely be using this in my daily skin regiment! I highly recommend this product! #BzzAgent #Loreal Revitalift [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The first thing that I immediately noticed was that the dark circles under my eyes started to disappear! I've been using the entire Revitalift system, with the face scrub, day moisturizer, night exfoliating pads and night moisturizer.

The exfolients and gentle cleanser leave me with a deep down clean that gently removes dirt, make-up and dead skin. I really like the soft citrus scent as well I am looking forward to see my results at the end of the 30 day challenge! #Bzzagent #L'Oreal Paris #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Excited to try L'Oréal's new line. I am always looking for a skin care regimen to fight the signs the aging. I have found some but they never promise everything they are supposed to. L'Oréal has a great reputation so my exceptions are high. I want my skin to look good with or without make-up. Day 1 before using any L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Gently exfoliates the skin leaving it smooth all day long. The moisturizers don't leave my skin feeling or looking oily at all. My skin has never looked this good, and all only within a week! Great product I'd recommend it if you're wanting to feel and look young again without the hassle. Can't believe I got to try this for free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far so good on these new products. I am only on day 3, but loving how it is feeling. It isn't itchy, smelly, or making me red. The only complaint I have is the night moisturizer is a little sticky feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
BzzAgent is awesome. I received my L'Oreal package over the weekend and begin my new regimen on Monday. I discontinued my previous regimen so that I could give this a fair try. The Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is not a harsh cleanser and gently exfoliates dead skin. I will continue using and give another review in the coming weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I'm one week in to my 30 day challenge of the L'Oreal Brightening line that I received free in the mail. So far, I love it! The scrub leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed, and the moisturizer leaves my face soft and smooth without making it oily. I have sensitive skin that is also prone to breakouts because it's oily, but I haven't experienced any breakouts or irritation. So far, I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I really love this facial scrub. It has little beads in it that honestly, I thought would hurt - I've tried others that had little beads that didn't feel very well! But L'Oreal Bright Reveal cleaned my face nicely! I use this product 2x a day. And I really can see a difference in my skin. It's not oily and doesn't dry my skin out like most cleansers.

Amazing face wash! I love the scrubbing beads and I feel like my skin is clean. After drying my skin it is so soft and clear looking. I am extremely careful around the eye area usually I use the same wash for face and eyes but with the results I am seeing already I do not mind at all. I love the scent almost a light citrus scent. I have extra sensitive skin and this face wash has caused zero issues . I highly recommend this and I will continue to buy this skin care . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I've only tried the product three times. But so far I really like the way it smells and it makes my skin really tingly. I took a before pic and in a week I will take another one so we can see the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product has an amazing aroma. Very light scent and some what of a grapefruit aroma. Very little is needed as I used only a dime size amount when washing my face. It cleans extremely well and removes the dark pigment impurities in my pores. I'm using it daily and it is a large size tube so I suspect it will last a very long time. Great product.

"I think the Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is AMAZING! I could actually feel the volcanic particles scrubbing my face as I gently rubbed. The product washed off very easily. My face felt smooth, refreshed and super clean! It wasn't dry or oily, just soft and supple. I noticed softer skin after only 3 days of using this cleanser. I think this product would make a great impression all on it's own, but the entire skin care line carries the most benefits. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This product is very similar to any other type of exfoliating cleanser but here is one subtle thing that makes me like it. The scrubbing bits are not the controversial microbeads which have been clogging up waste water facility. I've been using it for a week and find it a bit abrasive. Maybe doing it every other day may help. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've tried many scrubs and this one is among the best! It's not harsh but you can feel it's doing its job. Easy to wash it out, which is important, especially at 6 AM rushing to work)). Plus it's smells very nice, a little bit citrus-y)) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This stuff is aweaome. Has a gentle exfoliating action but does the job. Scent is a nice citrus scent that is not too overpowering. This might even replace my fave Phil****** microdermabrasion scrub.

"I'm just starting this challenge, so this was the first product I used. Scent is really important to me and I was so glad this scrub has a light, refreshing scent that is not overpowering.

"This is a very nice exfoliating facial cleanser. I used it in conjunction with a rotating facial brush most days, but even on days without the brush my skin felt smooth and refreshed. I think I can even tell a difference in the tone being a bit more even after having used it for a few weeks. No fancy tricks to it, just lather and rinse. I definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The facial scrub had a nice fresh scent with gentle beads that are very tiny that give a light scrub. I washed my mascara and face off with a regular cleanser and then used the scrub after. My face felt soft and smelled fresh. It's not harsh or if didn't irritate my skin. I have a lot of blemishes so I took a before shot and I'll take an after shot once the 30 days are over to compare the difference. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have noticed that in three days that my skin has cleared up, and feels so much more softer than before (goodbye pesky, flakey, rough spots). I am excited to see the results at week four.

My skin had been looking dull and definitely needed a little TLC. This scrub is just what the doctor ordered! Wow- it really does leave my skin glowing and soft.

"I really LOVE the Daily Scrub because it really gets into the skin and cleans really well. It also has a very nice ""Fruity"" smell, somewhere between an orange and a grapefruit. My face feels really clean and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This scrub smells great, it is not to abrasive. I have only been using it for one week with the other products and I can already tell the difference. My pores are minimized, imperfections are clearing, wrinkles and laugh lines are more subtle, skin is smoother and brighter. I can't wait to buy this product and continue with my new lifestyle change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is amazing! I have never tried a product that left my skin more tingling and rejuvenated after just one use!

I love the way I am seeing my skin brighten and tone, and I am in my early 40's! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the cleanser last night, right after I opened the box. This stuff is amazing. The scent is light, but wonderful. Like a grapefruit spritzer! It feels like a scrub/cleanser/exfoliater all in one! If you ever get the sugar scrub when you get a pedicure, then you know what I am talking about! My skin felt very smooth after using it, but it felt a little dry/tight as well. I would definitely recommend using the moisturizer after the cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

So after 2 days of using this product my face has a smoother texture and feels very nice. I use both morning and night and followed the directions and used the Revitalift peel pads and the moisturizers that came with my free sample from Bzzagent.com. Super impressed!!! I have Rosacea so trying new products can be stressful but this stuff WORKS!!! Buh-bye red bumps on my face!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I don't usually use an exfoliating cleanser for daily use, as they seem pretty harsh. This cleanser was gentle enough to use daily, and made my skin feel very smooth. I was also happy to see that pearlite was used as the scrubber instead of plastic microbeads. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Since my skin is sensitive at times, I was very cautious when I started using this cleanser, given that its texture is more like a scrub. However, I was surprised to find that if I apply it gently and use it on alternating days, it cleans my skin thoroughly without irritatng my skin. It's berry-like aroma is yummy and not heavy at all. I took off 1 star because my skin can't use this cleanser every day. It's exfoliant texture is thicker than other scrubs. Overall, i enjoyed using this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's really difficult for me to find a facial scrub that I don't like, the exfoliation feeling just feels amazing to me. With that said, I absolutely love the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Brightening Cleansing Scrub. The fragrance is a nice citrus, not overly chemically fragranced like some other brands. The exfoliation particles are gentle, making it difficult to over do it on the exfoliation process. I will be using this product for awhile! #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After having completed the 30-Day challenge, I was happy to see my complexion improve. The cleanser left my skin feeling fresh when I used it on a daily basis. I liked the microbeads but I learned that they are one of the worst pollutants on the planet so I have grave concerns about this. I used all the products and am happy to report that my skin actually does look brighter and fresher! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this facial scrub! I normally use an expensive facial regime but decided to give this product line a try. I was really curious to see how the two would compare. Let me just say that L'Oreal did not disappoint. I liked how bright my skin seemed after I washed with the facial scrub. I believe the results were better than my expensive brand! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked this daily scrub but never felt like it got my face totally clean. The texture is nice as is the smell, and I think my face is a bit brighter and even. One thing I didn't like, was that the longer I used it, the less I felt like it worked. So I will keep using this, just not daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I felt like the cleanser was not too harsh as far as the grains in the scrub but my skin felt very slick and tight after cleansing and was almost too rough for my skin. I saw no increased brightness in my skin whatsoever. I think this product might work better for someone with oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Revel Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is a scrub using very fine beads, so you get a gentle but definitely effective results. Leaves your skin soft and not overly raw.

From the first time trying this product in conjunction with the Revitalift Bright Reveal set I noticed a difference immediately. My face was not as dull and almost seemed to glow. Even so the exfoliating aspects of this cleanser seem just to harsh for everyday use. My face had at times a reddened irritated effect. I recommend using this once a week or so for the desired effects. I think the price point is great for this product. The scent is fresh and light. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser combines the strength of a physical and chemical exfoliation, yet is gentle enough to use on a daily basis. I used it in the morning and the evening and after a couple of days, I could already see my skin becoming softer, more even and smooth. My pores are not as large and it also keeps acne at bay.

"I have really enjoyed using the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. I have used it every day for the last month and I feel like it does a good job of cleaning my face.

I haven't really noticed a ""brightening"" effect, but I definitely feel like my skin is clearer and skin tone is more even. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love a good exfoliating scrub! This one has micro beads for a consistent scrub. It is at least a medium to high scrub so be careful to apply light pressure and let the beads do the scrubbing.

"I used L'Oreal Revitalift Bright daily scrub cleaner for the 30 days and I absolutely love it. It takes off all the dead dry skin on you face and it makes so much younger looking. I was impressed within the first few days of using, but after the 30 days my skin looks so much younger. This product is a keeper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'll say first that I love how scrubby this cleanser is and like how clean it makes my face feel. I used this for several weeks and liked the results but now I have noticed that it's too drying for my face. My cheeks are covered in dry flakey skin, yuck! I do use moisturizer in conjunction with this of course, I haven't a choice, I live in the desert. I plan to keep this in my rotation though and simply use it 2-3 times a week.

"I love the scrubbing beads, it feels great on my skin. I feel like the cleanser really cleans my skin and removes any dead skin cells to reveal brighter skin.

"I LOVE THIS PRODUCT My skin is cleaner, & smoother, than it has ever been ... i have sensitive skin, & scrubs are usually Not in my facial routine .

"I really liked this scrub. The granules are a little too abrasive for my sensitive face, but I love using it on my neck and decollete. The glycolic acid has helped reduce body acne.

"I think the scrub cleanser is the best one I have tried yet!!, My face feels so smooth and soft. Its been only a week and my face is brighter and toned! I cant believe how much it has helped ,with my dry skin areas on my face!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"NOT! L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser surpasses any product I have ever used. The micro pearls gently exfoliate my skin, leaving it feeling cleaner and fresher than ever. It has a light, pleasant citrus scent that is not overpowering. After using the cleanser in the mornings, I feel clean, fresh and wide awake, ready to tackle my day. Try it and see for yourself! You won't be disappointed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L oreal Paris Revitalift brightening daily scrub cleanser is great! I use it every day in my shower routine. My skin feels so smooth and soft and has improved in the past weeks. I will definitely keep it in my skincare routine. I love how my face looks brighter and cleaner and even younger!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use this product each night after removing my makeup. I find this scrub to be gentle, yet very effective. Initially, I was a tad nervous to use this, as I wondered if a scrub with glycolic acid might irritate my skin. Not the case at all! My skin feels refreshed and super-smooth after using this. I believe it makes my nighttime moisturizer that much more effective, too. I has a nice scent- like an orange creamsicle. Highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the feel of this scrub it leaves my skin feeling so fresh and the most important thing is I have NO Allergic reaction to it its very gentle on my skin. I then follow it up with the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal moisturizer which is an awesome product with it self. I am very sceptical about about anything I put on my face as most products break me out or give me red splotches. These products DO NOT do that! I will continue using this on a regular bases [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the products are ok; because I broke out after using all four products in the collection, night and day products, I broke out in small fine bumps and the night peel pads and night cream burned and turned me red. On a good note my skin does feel smoother and I think the items would work better on someone with less sensitive skin, then mine, I've continued to use just to keep giving it a chance, and now it doesn't burn quite as bad as the first couple of days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was truly pleasantly surprised. After only 2 uses, I was able to appreciate noticeably smoother skin. I am really looking forward to finishing up the tube and would really consider relying on this for my regular facial skincare. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was worried it might be to harsh on my skin. I absolutely love this product . The small beads in the scrub are very gentle and my face feels really fresh after each use. As the scrub gently exfoliates my skin the vitamin C is brightening it. I've Benin using this product for 2 weeks and I can see my skin is brighter. The burst of freshness and The scent really attracted me and I look forward to washing my face twice a day [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this a great Cleanser, I used it twice a day. It left my skin feeling and looking clean and fresh. I used all the products. First I cleansed then I used the peel pads ( the peel pads only at night). I was not too crazy for the brighting moisturizer. I felt my skin dry. Over all the products are really good. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The packaging is great, subtle with hints of bold red and metallic sheen. Easy open flip top lid. Just squeeze a bit out (about nickel size) and apply to damp face. An invigorating aroma fills your sense of smell while working product into a lather but it's not overwhelming at all, rather subtle. While rubbing, the microbeads gently exfoliate your skin and there are a lot of them! Rinses away clean, no residue. No adverse effects on my sensitive skin.

Any cleanser that has scrub in the title gets a side eye from me because I have sensitive skin but I was delighted with the opportunity to try the L'oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. I wasn't disappointed. My face was clean and refreshed. It wasn't dry or tight. I haven't had any breakouts or irritation. It lathers easily and rinses completely. It really does prep your face for the corresponding treatments from the L'oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is a foaming cleanser that gently exfoliates dullness to visibly reveal radiant skin. It's fortified with glycolic acid and vitamin C, plus natural volcanic particles and hydrating glycerin. This is so easy to use and it makes my face feel wonderful! I use it every morning! My skin does look brighter, fresher and more evenly toned after use! I am going to keep this line as part of my skincare routine!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My new favorite cleanser! Its like its peeling away my old skin, its amazing! The scrub is gentle enough to use everyday and the results are not hard to see, my fiance noticed after four days. Can't wait to see what happens as the days go on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Having used a lot of higher-end products, I was pleasantly surprised by this cleanser. I have normal skin, and this made my skin very soft and cleansed. There was no residue or leftover makeup on my face after using it. Due to the exfoliating particles, it cannot be used around the eyes. I can't say that the particles do much in this cleanser, but the cleanser gel itself is very good. I was provided this free by L'Oreal, but would probably repurchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I am about 10 days in using the daily cleanser both at morning, and at night. I love the gentleness of the scrub, as well as the light citrus smell. I feel using this in combination with the peel pads and the moisturizers, has really caused my skin to glow. I love how all the products have glycolic in them, which makes my skin brighter, and has a more even tone. My skin appears smoother in general. You can feel confident buying this new line of skincare! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is great! I like the microbeads because it's exfoliating my skin. The scent is nice and subtle not strong. It lathers into a nice foam and easy to rinse and I don't feel too dry after. My skin looks bright or less tan after using. I can definitely see it ""brightening"" my skin.

"This is fast becoming my new favorite cleanser. The micro pearls gently cleans my face, leaving it feeling soft and smooth. I really like how my skin feels after using this product.

"I love this product. After using the cleaner it makes my face feel soft and smooth. I love how the cleaner is not harsh on my skin, it doesn't burn and the scent is very nice. It's not a strong scent like so many products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
...after using the cleanser. The small beads exfoliate my skin and allow the other products to work even better since the dead skin is gone. I also like the tube container that it comes in.

"Many, many positives and very few negatives. I love the feel and freshness of my skin after use. I love the fresh aroma (not to floral, not to heavy) very mild scent and very pleasant. I was worried about the ""scrub"" 2x daily for fear of harsh but just the opposite happened. Felt very clean and was not harsh or abrasive. Only downfall, for me, was I like to use a cleanser that is good and safe around the eye area especially at night to remove make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this product every morning. I really loved the exfoliating included in this product afterwards my face felt toned and cleansed. I have freckles and after several uses they did brighten. I will purchased this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I tried the entire line as directed, my skin is softer due to the scrub but because my skin is so fair I don't think ""brightening"" will apply. If you can see from my before and after 7 days pic my skin actually looked better before so I will stick to my previous routine. The scrub was light and nice and had a good scent.

"Hello! So far I like the L'Oreal Bright Reviel. I hadn't heard anything about it so I was wondering if it's in stores. Then, yesterday, I saw a commercial where Jennifer Lopez was the celebrity spokesperson. That made be feel like the four products together actually work!

"This scrub cleanser is amazing!! The first night, I couldn't believe the results my face was brighter, softer and super clean. The scrub has sand-like particles that helps to remove dries and flaky skin. The mixture of this product smells like oranges and lemon zest gel, I have been using Revitalift system for the past 6 days and looking forward to see great results with the 30 day challenge. Thanks L'Oréal Paris #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The loreal fascial scrub is very invigorating on my face skin. It lathers wonderfully. Gets deep into my pores for a better clean.

"I think this product is amazing. I used all of the products since they arrived. My face no longer feels dry and tight. The brightening pads leave a little tingle, but do not dry the skin out. I will be recommending them. And will be purchasing again. This will be my new go to beauty regime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product. The exfoliating cleanser, leaves my skin cleaner than soap and water alone and feeling much softer overall. I was concerned about using an exfoliating cleanser twice a day. Sometimes after a few uses, they can leave your skin irritated. This cleanser has not left my skin irritated at all. I am only seven days into a 30-day challenge, but will keep you posted as I progress. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the L'Oreal Revitalift Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleaner that I received for free in my BzzAgent kit for a week now. I can not say how much I love love love this product! I was a die hard Olay girl, but the way I can feel this scrub doing its thing, I am now a L'Oreal girl. The amount of scrubby balls is great. My skin is so clean and clear looking. I am at a loss of words. Love!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using these products for a week so far since I received them. I love the way my face feels after using the Daily Scrub Cleanser. I normally like to exfoliate my face once a week but sometimes I forget to do it. The Daily Scrub Cleanser makes it easier every day/night! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like the feel of the scrub. Its not too harsh (doesn't burn your skin or feel like your getting wiped down with sand paper ) but its just scrubby enough and feels like its removing some dead skin. My face feels softer after I use the Daily Scrub Cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Im loving this daily face scrub. I have been using a week and already noticing less clogged pores, especially on my nose. I was concerned about skin sensitivity using a glycolic scrub daily, but I think its mild enough for daily use & effective enought to show results after only a week or so worth of washes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First and foremost, I have been using the Daily scrub morning and night and I LOVE the scent! I think it is amazing! It smells so fresh and clean and citrusy, invigorating.

The L'Oreal Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is definetly a quality scrub. The beads are very fine and real loosen up dirt and old skin cells.

I think the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is my favorite product. It feels amazing on my skin.

The product felt great and didn't dry out my skin. I have some hyperpigmentation from an acne breakout. I've heard great things about glycolic acid fading dark spots. Can't wait to see the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used this product for a few days, and I'm pleased with the result! The cleanser is filled with tiny, exfoliating grains that polish the skin, leaving your face looking radiant. I was concerned that my sensitive skin would be irritated by the grains, but I haven't had any problems. The ""soapy"" part of the product lathers as you start to rinse, removing dirt and oil from the skin. My face definitely feels softer after just a few days of use.

"I am the person who is afraid of using cleanser everyday but to try this cleanser I have been using it everyday . I am happy with the result. After a wash, my skin looks fresh and bright. It does not make my skin dry. I love the fact that it gives the radiant look. My skin is acne prone and easily affects by weather or humidity level.

I was super excited to try the L'Oreal revitalift bright reveal kit since my skin was parched looking from years of tanning. I have only been using for a week now and I am in love with this kit. My skin looks so much younger looking. It is no longer dry and dull looking. I also use on my neck as well. Great product you have come out with and will continue to purchase.

"The daily scrub cleanser is the best I have used. It is effective without being too harsh. My skin looked and felt clean. Even if I left makeup on it still removed all of it from my face. One wash was all it took. There is no stinging, no harsh chemicals burn, just really good looking skin. Price is right for the tube size which is very generous. Easy to use, and travel with. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this cleanser. It gently exfoliates my skin while cleaning it. I really needed an exfoliater as part of my skincare process so I was happy this had it. I feel like it leaves my skin feeling softer and removes the dead skin and dry parts on my face. This cleanser is better than the one I was previously using so I can see myself buying this after the sample is done. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This was the first time I used a daily scrub cleanser with glycolic acid. I was so afraid to use this product at first because I was thinking it could make my skin red and irritated. Surprisingly, it did not. I liked the gentle scent and the micro beads that helped exfoliate dead skin cells. What made me happy with this product is the fact that in just one week of using it, my skin felt soft and smooth. It did not make my skin oily and in fact, it got rid of two tiny pimples on my face.

This is my favorite product out of the four because it beat the facial cleanser I was currently using. It actually got every bit of make up off my face.

"I tried it both alone and with my Clarisonic. Works great both ways. Really felt like my skin was clean, but not tight. And it seemed like my skin could absorb my other products better! A little went a long way, and using it daily for about a week hasn't caused my skin any problems at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Daily Scrub Cleanser made my skin feel squeaky clean. I enjoy the feeling of a good scrub rather than a lather. It also has a great smell to it aswell. What was the most important aspect to this product to me that I liked was that it didnt leave my skin dry as other products I have used. I cant wait to see the difference in the brightness of my skin in the next week. I enjoyed using this today! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love the scrub! I have sensitive skin but have found that if I use a small amount with gentle circular motions it does not irritate and I get super soft skin with a nice glow.

"My skin felt soft after I used this cleanser. The cleanser had sand-like particles, I think it removed some layers of dead cells from my skin's surface. My boyfriend tried it too and he thought it worked well to remove his flaky skin. It gently exfoliated my face. The only thing I would worry about is to know if the micro-pearls are biodegradable? I read that micro pearls can have environmentally harmful material. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I generally have a problem with Skin Care products that have a scrub agent and that are anti-aging due to sensitive skin.

"So far, I've used the Brightening scrub for 4 days. My skin feels clean and fresh right after cleansing as well as throughout the day. My make-up looks better too, I think because of the exfoliating the scrub performs. I was given the Derm Exclusive facial products as a gift, I know that it is expensive and only available by mail. The Loreal cleanser, pads, and moisturizer make my skin feel exactly the same. I can't give a 5-star yet, I want to wait for a 30 result. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have just started using the L'Oreal Revitalift products. I love how the Daily Scrub Cleanser makes my skin feel. It is so clean and soft after only a few days.

"I've been using the Brightening Daily Scrub for just under a week and I'm really liking it so far. It's extremely easy to wash off, makes my face feel clean and doesn't leave it feeling dry. I think the roughness of the scrub is sufficient to get some exfoliation but not so intense that it's irritating to my skin. Once I've used it for a bit longer, ai'll be posting my before and after shots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this cleanser is amazing I've been using for about 5 days and I can really see a difference in my skin. My skin is brighter and I've noticed a reduction of fine lines.

"I'm about a week into the 30-Day challenge, and so far my skin is happy! I am a HUGE fan of face washes that have an exfoliating feel, and this one nails it. I also like that there isn't any noticeable scent. Good job on this one, L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using the scrub for a few days now and can tell a difference in my skin. After just having a baby my skin was worse for the wear and I feel this refreshes and truly brightens my skin. I did notice that if I went a day or two without using it my skin felt scaly and dry. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this is a great product that I will definitely use after this trial. In less than a week my face feels so much smoother and I can't wait to see what my face and skin looks like after 30 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been wanting to try these products for a while, so I was super excited about receiving this to test!! LOVED the scrub. It made my skin super soft.

"I am currently trying the 30-day challenge. I feel like these products are high-end and are good for my skin. The Daily Scrub Cleanser has great exfoliating granules that I feel are taking off the dead layers of my skin. My face feels refreshed and clean after using this cleanser. I really like it so far and am excited to continue to use it, along with the remaining 3 products in the collection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin never felt better! Thanks to L'Oreal's Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. This wonderful cleanser makes my skin feel so fresh and clean and more evenly toned. Just after a few times of using it at night, my pores look noticeably smaller. It gives that deep surface clean that ones skin really needs after a long day at work and or play. My face feels so refreshed, like having a pampering day at the spa! Love this cleanser!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Just got my Loreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection in and got started with it last night! So far my skin definitely feels softer and shines a little brighter!! Only just started this but I definitely already love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
As of today this is the best cleanser I have ever used. I have tried many different cleansers and they all left something to be desired. The last cleanser I used is supposed to be comparable to this one but it did not clean as well as the L'Oreal and it did not have as many scrubbing balls in it. I really like the way the L'Oreal cleanser makes my face feel. It feels clean and refreshed. It cleans my face but does not make it red or burn. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think, the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is the best I have tried yet. It scrubs gently and when you rinse your face, you feel and see the glow. I love this product. If you have never tried a scrub, try this one. It's a nice fresh feeling. DID not burn or feel greasy at all. I really believe this product speaks for itself. TRY IT!

"RevitaLift Radiant Smoothing Cream Cleanser Gently exfoliates dead skin cells and my skin looks smoother, brighter and more refined. Very cost effective! My only con is the flip cap top. I noticed water gets trapped in the cal and the product becomes loose and oozy - #BrightReveal #GotItFree @lorealparis [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried other brands' cleansers (Meaningful Beauty, Rodan & Fields to name a few) and I have to say that I like the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser best. It's got a good grit to it so the product really cleans and exfoliates the skin, leaving a nice texture once you are finished. The product cleans nicely and even though there is a lot of grit, it rinses off simply and easily. I would definitely recommend this scrub to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After the first use I notice how bright and clean my skin was and the smell is amazing. I gave the cleanser 4 out of 5 because I had to reduce the uses of the product because I began to break-out. My face cleaned once I began to use the product twice a month for a deep clean and exfoliate to reveal radiant skin. Thank you #BzzAgent and #L'Oreal #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love the very L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser! It is not runny like some of the other products I have used, it's more of a gel, with these really awesome little scrubbers in it. I like that it gently exfoliates every time I use it. I definitely can tell that my skin is smoother and brighter. Plus the smell is nice, not overpowering lime some others. I will definitely keep this in my routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked the gritty texture from the exfoliating beads and it worked really well with my clarisonic. It smells very nice. I do wish it had salicylic acid as opposed to glycolic acid in it because it didn't help with breakouts as much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L' Oreal has gone over & above with this Bright Reveal line. I've tried them all but the Daily Scrub Cleanser has to be my favorite. It is VERY gentle but oh so effective. My skin has not looked this good in years. It actually feels nourishing to my skin not drying. I would definetely rccommend the entire line of products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the smell of this! It has such a light, citrus and clean smell. I wasn't thrilled with the amount of beads in it. I found they were really hard to rinse off. I used it in the shower and It seemed to take forever to get them all rinsed away. I couldn't use it every day-too harsh. Maybe good for two or three times a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin is glowing. This is an amazing scrub it has a light fresh scent and it feels great. Before using this product you need to know that if you don't use L'Oreal Paris Revitalift brightening moisturizer you will need a facial sunblock and the micro-pearl don't rinse off easy however the benefits of this product outweigh this. I adore the clear bright glow my face has thank you Bzzagent and L'Oreal Paris for the free products and including me in this awesome campaign! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wanted to wait a few weeks before a gave a review on this line of products. I wanted to determine if there were true results that I could actually see. I would have to say that the daily cleanser does work. It is a light exfoliating cleanser. I used it in conjunction with my battery powered scrub brush. The granules in the cleanser were not harsh on my skin. I would definitely bye again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wish I could show photos but I had nasal surgery so don't have any after photos. But I can tell you that I fell in love with this cleanser. My face feels so clean and refreshed after using it. My skin is brighter and more evenly toned. I am definitely keeping this as part of my daily regime and you should too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a faboulus cleanser. I have normal to dry skin, depending on the time of year. This cleanser does not disappoint. It lathers up perfectly with just the right amount of scrubbing action. I prefer to use it at the end of the day before bed. It leaves my skin feeling so clean and fresh. I really like the scent too. Thank you L'Oreal for an awesome product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love using the cleanser. I use it every evening. It makes my face feel and look bright. I like the scent. It is light and pleasant. It is gentle on my face yet it washes away the dirt. My face feels clean and I have not had a breakout since using this product along with the lotions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this Daily Scrub! It has a very clean and citrus-like scent that is just fantastic and it really does a great job cleaning and exfoliating my skin. It is not too abrasive and a very gentle exfoliant. This scrub combined with the fabulous moisturizers of the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal make the perfect combo for radiant skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is one of my most favorite products from the new L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Collection. After just one use my face felt so soft. I am very cautious using facial products due to fragrance and this has a nice, light smell that is not too much. This is my new go to facial cleanser. I really like that a little goes a long way, as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't convinced at first, but after regular use of this scrub (along with the others) has caused my face to become illuminated and I'm receiving compliments all the time! Of course, I let them know exactly what's doing it and I encourage them to try it for themselves. I'm loving this cleansing scrub. I can't leave home without it!!

I tried the Revitalift Bright Reveal daily sub cleanser and absolutely loved it. I love the tiny gritty pieces in the scrub. Leaves my face feeling clean and soft. It doesn't cause redness like other cleansers I've tried. #GotItFree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this product as a facial scrub! I have very sensitive oily skin and in the past daily scrubs have caused my skin to either break out or been too harsh; however, I used this every day and I had no such problem. I think it worked wonderfully as a daily facial washing scrub! I even had to fight my husband for it who loved it too. So, why only four stars? Well, I didn't really think it really helped my skin look brighter as such; however, I will be purchasing it or my husband will! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. It made my skin tingle and feel refreshed. I used this first thing in the morning. After I washed it off, I had a clean feeling. It did not feel like I was all dried out like some other products do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I cannot believe how soft my skin feels after using the Daily Scrub. I have to wash my face several times a day due to work conditions, and this had helped SO much with the drying out and peeling I always faced before with other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like how it feels on my skin and it really smoother. I like what it does it my skin when I put it on at night. I never really used different product for my wrinkles or skin problems but this really works. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really wanted to love this cleanser, but it just didn't work out that way. The scent wasn't bad, and I absolutely LOVE the concept behind it. Unfortunately, it turns out my skin really didn't like it - I wound up breaking out fairly significantly, and I almost never break out. I knew my skin was a bit sensitive, but this is extreme for me. I'm not entirely sure which product did it, but it was something in this line. I won't be using it again - back to my regular routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cleanser was just kind of meh for me. I wasn't wowed by it or even super happy with it. It just didn't seem like anything special to me. The exfoliation wasn't enough for my liking and it didn't really leave my face feeling as clean as I would like, especially on days I was sweating or wearing makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the way my skin feels and looks after using my free sample of Loreal revitalizing brightness cleanser. from the first day I started using it I could feel a difference in the Vitality of my skin. it's a product I will continue to buy and continue to brag about. so excited to find a product that actually works this well exclamation [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The daily scrub is a great product! I've noticed a difference in my skin since using this product. It smells great and is just abrasive enough without being too much for my skin to handle. My skin feels and looks great! I intend to continue using this product line in the future and recommending it to friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This exfoliating cleanser is the best that I have ever used. I can feel it working and cleaning out my pores as I use it. I have found that I have fewer breakouts since using it. The skin on my face is visible smoother! I love the way it feels. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really liked this cleanser. It has tiny scrubbing beads that clean well but are not rough on your skin. My skin in much softer and smoother. It removes make-up well. I have fewer black heads and tiny bumps on my face. My neck feels and looks smoother as well. I use the cleanser at morning and night. I plan to continue to use this cleanser. Even my hands feel smoother. This product is a keeper. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Although I liked the exfoliation from this, I did find that it was a little too rough for my skin. After 2 weeks I began to get pretty dry and could not use it everyday. I started using it every other day and it got better. Overall a pretty good cleaser and I did notice my skin was brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this scrub is amazing. It's really gentle, but very effective. I felt a difference in the texture of my skin right away and that almost never happens. I have used it every day, and have seen so much improvement in my skin and the healthy glow is amazing. I also loved the pads, and the day lotion is so soft!

"This exfoliating cleanser caught me from the first moment you use it, in fact it was the first I did a review, texture, smell and how soft it leaves your skin from the first wash, clean feeling, everything I love this cleansing cream, L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Brightening daily Scrub Cleanser Reveal is my new favorite, I talked to my friends and family how fabulous is this cleansing of daily use, even buy gift for my mom and told me that he liked.

"I think this product is absolutely great!! First I love the citrus smell, and you only need a very small amount of the product so it will last a long time. It is a very gentle scrubbing cleanser and made my face feel wonderful!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This line has a great concept however I failed to see any positive results. The cleanser doesn't actually clean your face which is why the peel pads follow the cleanser. It has made me breakout, leaves my skin greasy and pores have been exacerbated in size. Not worth the hassle with this line of products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the Revitalift daily scrub for 30 days. I received the Revitalift system free in exchange for my honest review. I have enjoyed using this product. It gently exfoliates dead skin, has a nice citrus scent, and has not caused any sensitivity to my face. I plan to continue using this face scrub. Before you use this product please make sure to use a moisturizer with sunscreen or be sure to apply sunscreen to your face to prevent sunburn. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this scrub. It leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth. I like that its gentle yet effective at exfoliating and can be used daily.

"I am very picky about the face cleansers that I use, but L'Oreal Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is my new fave. It does have a slight grainy texture, but that helps with exfoliation. It cleans well and is still gentle enough to use daily. I have also noticed that my blemishes have cleared up and my skin tone is more even. Not to mention, it also had s great light citrus scent! I love that I #gotitfree from #bzzagent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I need to exfoliate my face at least 2X a week and this is a great option. I wouldn't say it's an everyday product but a couple times a week and your golden. The only negative that I've experienced is that after use and my regular moisturizer I find my face gets oily. I have oily skin naturally but after this its extra shiny/oily, another reason to use only a couple times a week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This scrub is amazing. My skin felt softer, brighter, and results were super fast. My skin is African and it worked fine, no dryness, beakouts, etc. Definitely will continue to use the entire 4 piece set [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that the L Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright reveal face scrub is one of the best I have ever tried. I have tried burts bees face scrub and a nutrogena face scrub. I have to say that the Revitalift scrub is awesome because it is the only one that doesn't make my face dry out from using it daily. This stuff is amazing!

I was excited to receive this in the mail. The scrub cleanser is not to rough on your skin but your skin is so soft and clean after using. It has a orange smell to me. I would recommend this cleanser to everyone.. Thanks BzzAgent [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used my regular cleansing cream for 35 years before I decided to try the Revitalift Bright REveal Brightening Daily Scrib Cleanser. I loved the new stuff, however, after about 2 hours, my face was very oily. I did not like the feel of an oily face. I tried it for about a week before I went back to my old cleanser.

The cleanser makes my skin feel radiant!! Thanks for the opportunity to try the L'Oreal Revitalift cleanser for free! I will definitely continue to use your products. This is a trusted brand with quality products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When I first started with the daily scrub I loved the little beads and the smell is amazing but after a week of daily use I felt like it was more abrasive then I would like for daily use. Maybe if this was a once or twice a week thing I would enjoy it better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love the way this product line smells. I think this scrub is the best i've ever tried. I have sensitive skin and have had no problems while using this. My face is soft and smooth. I love it when a product does what it says and this one does. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked this scrub. My skin felt softer and looked smoother after a week. I did feel like it stopped after that. My oily skin came back, and I didn't feel like there was a change. But then I noticed a change again. So I guess my skin just had to adjust. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had a blast using the bright reveal products. I love the formulated goodness that is this product. This wash is effective without drying out my skin. I felt fresh and renewed afterwards. My skin did in fact look bright and more consistent after a week and continues to brighten as I continue to us this. I'm 37 and happy to find products that keep my skin looking fresh and young.

"It worked well. The moisturizer was pretty much what I used already from Mary Kay - (Day/Night solution) The wipes weren't strong enough for me - I needed a little more toner in it for oil-control. The cleanser was good also - If I wasn't hooked on Mary Kay products, I may have switched to using this full time. I wanted to thank Loreal and BzzzAgent for allowing me to try this product free of charge! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the product, how easy it was too use and how it made my skin feel. I was very disappointed to learn that the scubbing items are actually plastic microbe ads which will soon not be able to be used in facial products because they are clogging up our sewer system. This Sadly was my only negative about the products. Change this to a natural scrubber and I will definitely purchase in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love these products, I was wanting to try them but was a little bit nervous to. Boy am I glad I did. My skin looks freshener n younger. I love the way it leaves my skin after ea use.

"I have been using the scrub cleanser for 30 days now and I have noticed much clearer skin! Since I'm a runner, I also use this on my chest and back to keep from breakouts.

"I've tried the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal collection a few times, following their directions explicitly and found my face breaking out after every use. I wish that I could use the line without issue but no such luck. If you don't use sunscreen on your face already you will if you're using this collection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was skeptical if I should really use the scrub twice a day as directed on packaging because I always heard that once a day was enough. but I found it gentle enough for my skin that it was not a problem and I love the scent and the clean feel my skin has after using it. I also used it on my neck area as I was scrubbing to give my neck skin some polishing as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Loved this scrub and will make it a part of my everyday routine! This product made my skin feel so clean and soft, and didn't dry my skin out or irritate it.

It took about a week to notice results, but I'm loving the skin on my face now. I was not able to use this the recommended twice daily, but just once daily.

"I think that this face wash is one of the best I've tried. I like the scent as it isn't too overpowering but subtle. The consistency is almost gel like, not runny like some products. One of the best parts for me was the exfoliating you get to do every time you use it washing away the old skin and in with the bright and healthy new skin. It kept my face less oily as well.

"The facial cleanser is the best I have used in the recent past. I used the cleanser everyday during the week and on the weekends I use a different one at my friends house. I can tell the difference. My face is smooth and refreshed, not so with the other cleanser I used on the weekend. The cleanser has an exfoliate consistency to it and make your face feel like it is truly clean.

This cleanser is amazing. I prefer my exfoliating cleanser to have a good bit of grit to it and this is perfect. It's not harsh but really leaves my face feeling fresh and completely clean. It doesn't dry me out or leave that tight squeaky clean feeling. I love the light fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the way this scrub/cleanser combo exfoliated and smoothed my skin. I am a bigger fan of cleansers that I can use to remove my eye makeup, which you CAN'T do with this due to the scrubbing particles. But I used this day and night and my skin was smooth and hydrated. It definitely helped to even out my skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser every day for a month, and the results far exceeded my expectations. My skin looks younger and feels smoother than it has in years. Being a scrub cleanser, the texture is a little coarse, but I actually prefer it because I can make sure I am covering every bit of skin. I will continue to use this product, and would recommend it to everyone as well. I received this product in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this for almost 30 days any my skin feels great and amazing. My face stay hydrated and looking young and healthy. I had severe dryness and with this product my face stays moisturized.

"One of my favorite parts of my day is my end of the day scrub before bed! L'Oreal is a great evening scrub! Especially when used in conjuction with the L'Oreal Peel pads! The one down size, the size of the bottle! Because it's so small I only use it at night! I'd love to use it multiple times of the day! But with such a small bottle I find myself choosing other scrubs or just soap during the day! However, at night this is a great refreshing product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What I noticed that I liked first was the fresh scent of this scrub. It was nice and invigorating at the end of the day. I really, really liked how soft it left my skin after use. It's definitely softer than it has ever been after using other products. I gave it a few weeks before writing my review, and I really feel like some of the sun spots and aging spots that I saw before are gone. Using this in the summer was perfect and I will continue to use it in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the L'Oreal Revitalift daily scrub!!!!! I was a little hesitant to try it only because I have sensitive skin and I thought using the scrub twice a day would be too much...but I was wrong! The scrub is so light and gentle and has a fresh subtle scent. After using it your skin feels so fresh and bright. I most certainly will continue using this product!!!! Thank you L'Oreal for the free sample! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the L'Oréal cleanser. It has a fresh smell, is not harsh, and leaves my skin feeling very clean. I have normal skin and the cleanser does not dry out my skin. The granules are an added bonus in achieving the fresh, clean, feel. The price of the cleanser is reasonable and I will be continuing to use the product. Comparable in quality to higher end cleansers that I have used. It would be perfect if it did not burn the eyes. Love the product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received four Revitalift products to try from L'Oreal. The L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser was my favorite of the products.

I tried the facial scrub and used it as directed. I think it needs to only be used once or twice a week. I noticed my skin was drying and cracking in spots. I have stopped using it as often and those spots are slowing starting to go away with the help of the moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this is one of the best cleansers that I have ever used. This collection is fabulous!! It scrubs my face completely clean and smells great too. I actually look forward to washing my face! Will definitely keep using this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"You can really feel the ""clean"" after washing with the Daily Scrub cleanser. The scrubbing additive is not too harsh and leaves my face feeling refreshed and with a very pleasant scent. When I first started using the scrub, I had a small breakout...I believe that was just related to the product drawing out impurities. The blemishes went away pretty quickly and my face has been clean and clear ever since. I would definitely recommend this cleanser! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I think this is one of the best cleansers I've used. It scrubs my face completely clean without feeling to harsh or leaving my face tight and dry. It has a very clean fresh scent that's invigorating.

I will definitely buy this product in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the four piece kit of the Loreal Revitalift Bright Reveal. The only product of the four that I really liked was the facial scrub. The other three just didn't work for me and my skin type. I found the scrub non irritating and my skin was very smooth after using it. I didn't really notice any ""brightening"", but my face did feel better. I might purchase this in the future.

I have sensitive skin and am always leary to try something new on my face. I received a sample of this cleanser and I have enjoyed using it. It leaves my face feeling clean and refreshed and I have had no problems using it consecutively. I will likely buy this product and would recommend it to friends .

"I am still not done with this product, but overall I found it delicate yet effective. The ""grains"" are not too harsh on my skin but they are effective in exfoliating. Overall, this is a great product that I will buy after the trial period is over. Together with the other products of the same line, it makes my skin look healthier and fresher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this face scrub is pretty cool. It scrub very well but is far from being abrasive. It is creamy and it leaves my skin very smooth and since I've started using the kit, my skin looks brighter and healthier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This scrub is great for everyday use. You can feel your skin tightening with just the first use.It sloughs dead skin,helps reduce fine lines and brightens. Scrubs tend to be a little to rough but honestly this one had just the right amount of ""scrub"" so that it doesn't hurt to use like other similar type face products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product and it left my skin greasy . It was great at taking my makeup off but I'm not a big fan of it and I'm not going to purchase this item . I didn't see any visible results and its just so expensive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really wanted to like this but it was just ""ok"" I felt it cleaned enough but there are others on the market that clean better. My face felt clean after using the product but I didnt notice any real difference in respect to exfoliation which I did expect since its supposed to be a scrub. As I said there are definitely other products on the market that do a better job of cleaning AND exfoliating. I gave 4 stars just because it does cleanse but it is just average.

"After using the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal products for almost a month, I'm definitely impressed. My skin feels much softer and much less oily. There's also been noticeable improvement to the tone of my skin. Overall, I really enjoy these products and plan to continue using them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free product from BzzAgent and L'Oréal Paris. It has Glycolic acid and even though it is a daily scrub cleanser, it is gentle on the skin and my skin feel noticeably cleaner after using the product. The product has a light, and refreshing scent which I really like. After using it for a few weeks, I notice that my skin is smoother and looks brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really loved all the products at first but eventually it seemed the brightening daily scrub was a little to much for my skin. I would use it in the future but not every day. I think 2-3 times a week would be more like it for me. I don't consider my self to have sensitive skin but it was a little too abrasive long term. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this exfoliating cleanser. After the first use, I ran into the bedroom and made my husband feel how soft my skin was. I was worried my sensitive skin would have some irritation with continued use, but after 30 days of day and night use, no irritation just soft met brighter skin. I love this product and will continue to use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cleanser did a good job of cleaning my skin but the chemicals in it were/are really too strong for my skin to use them on a daily basis. I don't consider myself to have ""sensitive"" skin but I felt this was too much for my skin. But I know some people who require much more than what my skin does in order to stay healthy so maybe this is more geared towards them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked these products, except the peel pads. They seemed dry and had that alcohol smell to them. I loved the daily scrub cleanser, making my skin look brighter. Makes my skin feeling healthy. The dual overnight moisturizer is great it doesn't leave your skin to greasy and yet its easy to use and the day moisturizer with SPF 30 didn't have that sunscreen smell to it.

"I was hesitant to try something like this. I have had blotchy skin for the longest time. I was already using a scrub daily, but got to try the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for free, so it was worth a try. My dark patches have definitely lightened over the last month and others have noticed the different as well. I loved the way that it foamed up, and really made my skin feel clean.

This is my favorite out all four Loreal items that were sent to me! I've been using it daily and love the way it makes my face feel. It also has a good bit of sunscreen in it if you pair it up with some foundation. I will definitely be making a purchase of this when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Before I tried the 30-day challenge with the L'Oreal products, I used Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser. I prefer the L'Oreal Daily Scrub because it makes my skin feel cleaner, without being too harsh. I like having the micro-pearls in the scrub, rather than just a liquid. Other products I've tried are not usually for even daily use, so I'm glad this one is. I don't think my skin is any brighter using it, though, even using it with the other 3 products as directed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have sensitive skin and used this cleanser daily. My skin has never felt smoother. I don't wear make up regularly. My husband has asked me on numerous occasions if I had makeup on. My skin tone has really evened out! #gotitfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great cleanser. I have dry skin and very picky about my cleanser. This exfoliates and lathers up just right to evenly go over skin. Gives a very soft, clean and bright feel on my face. With the exfoliate I was unable to use everyday. Worked well together with the day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this product and have used it for the past couple of weeks. I really like it and have recommended it to friends and family. I will continue buying this product. Thank you for letting me try it. My face is smoother and I have little to no brown spots left on my face. It also has helped with the fine lines around my eyes and on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I absolutely LOVE the LOreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser! It is the perfect way to prep your face to use the LOreal line of Bright Reveal products. It leaves my face feeling clean and soft. I have been using over 30 days now and see so much more clarity in my skin. I am prone to freckles in the summer so this line is absolutely perfect for me. I am sold on this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have been using this cleanser for almost 30 days and my skin looks great, I am so happy that I received the Revitalift Bright Reveal collection from BzzAgent to review for free. The cleanser leaves your face feeling clean and shiny. I have sensitive skin and was afraid I might break out from this product but that wasn't the case at all, in fact it helped clear up my skin. I would recommend this to anyone who has sensitive skin, its a great cleanser for any skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Loved the whole kit. From the moisturizer to the scrub it has left my face feeling exfoliated and renewed. Not dry and the cream works amazing. I love this whole kit and will continue to use them and def recommend them to all my friends [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"i truly believe this product is responsible for less wrinkles, less hyperplasia and brighter skin. I love everything about it, easy to use, gentle and I have very sensitive skin with rosacea and I was able to use without a problem! Miracle in a jar is what I will call this!

"I am generally skeptical when it comes to beauty products. Not this timemail! The Loreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection has made me a believer! After two uses of the cleanser, pads, and day and night creams, I noticed that my face felt smoother and looked brighter. After thirty days of using the collection my skin has this glow to it. I am so happy to finally find a product line that works just as it says it would! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the product a couple of times, but I am not a fan of these types of cleansers. They are abrasive and hard to get off my skin. I feel like I have sand on my face after washing it with this cleanser. I received this product for free as a Bzz agent, but I would not buy this product. It is just not for me [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just love the way my skin feels after using this, its such a fine grain scrub. I feel fresh and new when I use it. and doesn't cause redness like some scrubs I've used. I follow up with the brightening moisturizer and my make up goes on so much better and flawless. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Overall, I am pleased with this product. I rarely ever try skin products, once I find something that works I stick with it. I like the feeling of the scrub, washing away the dead skin, making my skin feel fresh. My daughter said she noticed a new glow to my skin. I really liked hearing that someone noticed a difference in my skin. I noticed that my skin looked better. I really like the scent of this product too. Definitely will be using this product again.

Love the LOreal Revitalift products! I have been using all of them for 30 days now and love how the LOreal Revitalift Brightening Scrub and peel pads makes my face feel fresh. The day and night Revitalift moisturizers have been fantastic. #BrightReveal #GotitFree @LOrealParisUSA [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was excited to try the L'Oreal Bright Reveal line of products. I tried them all (Daily Scrub Cleanser, Overnight Moisturizer, Brightening Moisturizer and Peel Pads). I'd have to say that these products are definitely not meant for anyone who has sensitive skin. After a week and a half of trying the combo, my skin was very angry. It had become a pink/red color all over, and I was starting to break out! I had to stop using them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the gentle scrubby action of this cleanser! I'm finished with my 30 Day Challenge and the cleanser was one of my favorite steps of the routine. The citrusy scent was awesome and it's so easy to rinse off. Plus, after 30 days of using the scrub, day and night, I still have tons in the tube. This was great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The skin feels soft and tight without feeling dry. Most cleansers leave your skin feeling like sand paper. This one is gentle for my sensitive skin but feels fresh. Suffering from sensitive skin, I have to be careful with the products I use. I will definitely keep buying this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this product all of the kit. The scrub feel great and smell great. I haven't had breakout with this product surprised. And my skin is smooth bright and clear. The scrub make my skin a little dry but once you put on the moisturizer it feel smooth. And the pads I love definitely the night cream great. In the morning it feel smooth and clean.

"I love this scrub. It is so fine that it could actually be used everyday. I put it on dry skin, rub it in. Then when I add the water it makes a great cleanser. And did I mention the fresh citrus smell. A little goes a long way. My skin is so smooth and never a tight feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love the L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser! It instantly softens my skin and doesn't dry it out at all. It leaves my skin looking clear with a healthy glow. What I also love is the fact that the exfoliating particles in the cleanser are natural and ecofriendly. (No plastic microbeads affecting the water supply and wildlife!) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was given this cleanser to try as a Bzzagent for my honest feedback Unfortunately, I was not a big fan of the cleanser. Did it clean my face - yes! However, this product burned a little too much for my taste. I thought after using a few days the burning sensation would stop or be reduced, but it seemed to get worse so I had stop using after one week. I also am very sensitive to the smell of products I use and this cleanser has a very medicinal/chemical smell that I did not like. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is amazing! I have sensitive skin and was nervous about switching cleanser. I was amazed from the first use. The cleanser was very gentle on my skin yet exfoliated my skin like I couldn't believe. I usually use a facial scrub sponge and this cleaner exfoliated better than that! Yet it was more gentle than the scrub sponge. It removed dry skin and impurities right from the start. It left my skin feeling clean and refreshed. I will definitely be sticking with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal 30 day challenge did wonders for my skin. The cleanser is very light, and has little scrubby beads that really scrubbed the skin, what amazed my was the fact that my skin didnt feel dry or tight after using it. I have very sensitive skin, and was hesitant about the Glycolic acids because my skin did not react well to other products that had this. But i didnt have ANY issues!

"So far this has been a pretty good scrub as part of my nightly routine. However, I found I can't use it every night as it started to really dry out my skin, even when using moisturizer. I backed off to every other night. I believe that this scrub has helped brighten my skin and remove some of the brown spots I suffer from. I'm pleased so far, will continue using it to see if the results continue to be positive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"There are so many great things about this cleanser. I love the texture and the way it gently exfoliates my skin while it cleans it. It leaves my skin feeling bright and young in addition to fresh and clean. I think the cleanser has a light, citrusy scent that is so refreshing and helps me to wake up in the morning. This is a great start to the Bright Reveal skin routine. I plan to keep using it even after I run out of the sample I was given. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the texture and smell of the scrub cleanser. After cleansing, my face felt softer and smoother. In addition, it did not take a ton of the product which meant the product would last for a long time (which good for my budget!). Unfortunately, the products caused my face to break out (not sure which specific product it would have been since I was using them all) so I stopped using them. Gave a 3 due to texture, scent and feel of skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Loved this! I use it every day and so far my face has become very smooth and radiant, my face feels renewed. I would recommend this to people who want to have a more brighter and smoother face.

"I do not normally use many new products on my face but I decided to give this a try and have loved it ever since. It leaves my face feeling clean, refreshed, and does not dry it out!

My face sometimes breaks out easily when I start using new products but it has been nothing but wonderful since I have started using this. I absolutely love it!

"This cleanser is great! It has a light grapefruit scent and is gentle enough to use every day and evening. It really helps to get the dull skin off and prep it for the pads or lotions to follow. It works better if your hands and face are wet first, and you can either rinse off with water or use a washcloth to remove the scrub. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using L'Oreal reveal daily scrub cleanser every day now since i received it. I have been using all of the L'Oreal products I received daily. I like all the products but I really like the scrub cleanser. After I use it my face feels really clean. Also I had a few problem areas on my face and now they are almost cleared up. I tried everything but this is the first product that is clearing up my skin. I'm so happy I got the chance to try these great products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This face wash is a great daily cleaner. My skin definitely felt tighter after washing. I would recommend putting on a lotion after though, because your skin can easily dry out after use. I did receive this product from loreal paris and bzz agent for the purpose of giving my honest review. Having received this at no cost has not influenced my experience or review of this product.

"I loved being able to try this line of products. The brightening scrub was refreshing and left my skin feeling clean and bright.

"I've been very impressed with this cleanser since I began using it a couple of weeks ago. It's gentle enough to use every day without drying or irritating my sensitive skin, but effectively cleans out my pores and leaves my face silky soft. Highly recommend.

I like that it leaves your face feeling clean the little beads are not harsh at all. I use it twice a day so hopefully I will see a difference. I do have acne prone and oily skin so it's hard to find a product that works with my skin type. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I LOVED the smell of the daily scrub cleanser. It had a Citrus scent and this really smelled great. I also liked the texture of the scrub.

"This L'OREAL Brightening Day Moisturizer is amazing. It's SPF 30 and does have a hint of the sunblock smell, however a little goes a LONG way. It's light, and does not feel stickey or make you feel like you have anything on your face. Add this after you clean your face and right before you leave for the day. You can re-apply because this stuff is more than a month supply. This is a must have girls! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Out of all of the L'Oreal 30 day challenge products this one was my favorite. My face felt so nice and soft. Even within 1 week I could feel the difference. I have super sensitive skin and the exfoliants in the wash did not irritate my skin at all. Which is a super plus because it is so hard to find an exfoliating wash that doesn't make my skin sting after i am finished with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have no complaints about L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. My skin looks amazing! I've not had a single blemish. I have been told that I am glowing!

"I am in my third week using the complete system. At the beginning the first think that I noted was the grain in the scrub was much bigger than the one I used regularly. After the first week my skin was breaking out, but I thought that because the stronger exfoliation that I was doing on it, so I decided keep using the product. After those couple of day, my skin began to look smooth and feel cleaner in a deeper level [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love the way it cleans my face and really love the orange scent. My face was smoother after the first use. It's not harsh on my skin.

"I have tried countless facial scrubs over the years all with varying results and I wasn't sure if I would notice much of a difference with this one. I ended up really liking it! My face always felt clean afterwards, the scrubbing parts of the cleanser were gentle - which is important to me as someone with sensitive skin - and it was not strongly scented. I've also noticed that my skin looks more radiant than usual! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"That was the product which I like the least from the whole line. Firstly my skin became sensitive, especially around cheeks and temples. But I assume that I didn't use that types of product before and just rubbed it too intense. I tried to put it in more gentle circular motions and it worked great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This scrub is one of the best I've ever tried. It lathers up very well and feels so smooth going on. Unlike other scrubs this is so gentle but you can tell it's done some serious exfoliation. You can see the results immediately. If you have age spots, or rough patches you'll want this scrub in your life. In only a few days of use I saw dark spots diminish and rough spots really smooth out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is a really great product. At first use I had a burning,tingling sensation that lasted an hour but the use thereafter was fine. It works well with lifting the dirt that is hidden on face in which makes you look much brighter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

For the first week my skin had no adverse reaction to the beads in the cleanser. Now I cannot say that is true - I gave my skin a break from using the cleanser and it cleared right up - no more red bumps or irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My face feels so refreshed after using the scrub. I use it morning and night. I like to feel my face afterward - so smooth!

This isn't harsh like other scrub products on the market, and it has a wonderful citrus scent that wakes me up in the morning! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the L'Oreal Paris products are awsome i tried all of the products i received for free. I was amazed just after one week. It brighten my face. The age spots and redness disappeared. Now i dont have to use a cover up on my face. My face looks radiant [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really enjoying using this Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. There is just enough micro pearl beads to gently exfoliate my skin. I only use a little because the cleanser lathers up really well. Thanks for the free sample, L'Oreal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal's Revitalift bright reveal daily scrub cleanser is an awesome daily scrub. The little beads make for an excellent exfoliant and I love the smell. I get the perfect amount of lather and it rinses clean without leaving an residue. I have been on the lookout for a new cleanser since my old one was discontinued and this has everything I was looking for. Thank you L'Oreal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Unfortunately this is not right for my skin. I have very sensitive skin with a tendency toward rosacea. I checked the ingredients and found that often people with rosacea have good results with this and similar products, so I had high hopes. So after 7 days its only getting worse so I have to stop use now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the citrus scent first of all. The tingly clean feeling as I washed my face and the soft, smooth, not-stripped feeling afterward were a total win for me. This product made me feel refreshed and pampered. Here I am with the scrub on my face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am loving L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser! My face feels so clean and fresh after washing. I am starting to notice a more even tone to my skin and I am super impressed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The face scrub is a nice one, it isn't too harsh and smells nice as well. I have been using it for a week now and, although I was nervous, have had good results so far. I deal with rosacea and am pleased with how it seems to be working overall. Usually when I start a new regiment like this I have break outs but this one hasn't had a bad reaction. I'm pleased with this product and feel it cleans well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that this is a foaming AND exfoliating cleanser. It doesn't take a lot of product to get my face clean. The exfoliating bits are big enough to be noticeable, which I like, but not so rough that I feel like it's damaging my skin. It rinses completely clean. My favorite part though, is that it doesn't leave my skin with that overly tight, dry feel. My face just feels clean and refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love it!!! They exfoliating makes my skin feel really clean and soft... I use it in the morning and night along with the peel pads at night and moisturizers day and evening and I think these products are AWESOME!!!! I would definitely recommend the whole Bright collection!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love how clear the instructions and precauctions are, no guessing what they mean. So far after Afew weeks my skin is much softer and even feels smoother. Still waiting on those fine lines to disappear. I have Afew weeks of product left so we shall see! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the daily scrub is absolutely amazing. I love the citrus smell and how great it exfoliates. Just a little of the brightening daily scrub cleanser goes a long way. It's not like other products where you have to use huge amounts. This product has made such a huge difference in my skin. Just after a couple days I noticed the difference. It's smoother and brighter. My complexion is alot clearer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the cleanser and i have seen a difference on my face. Firts it is soooo soft evertime i use it. My face looks brighter and i have seen an improvement on my dark spots.

"The loreal daily scrub cleanser made my skin feel clean and not tight feeling. It was great to use in the summer especially when you have been using sunblock every day and your skin feels clogged. It smell good,not too heavy and it was free! Easy to use and apply, easy straight forward instructions. I would and have recommended this product to a lot of people when they commented on my skin and also recommended that they check out bzzagents [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoy using this scrub. It has a light fresh scent, and the scrubbing beads really leave my skin feeling ""new"" and soft. I received this product for free from L'Oreal Paris in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This product will definitely replace my previous scrub, due to how it leaves my skin feeling after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This scrub works wonders. It has completely gotten rid of my blackheads. My face feels wonderful knowing and seeing the deep blackheads are now gone. I have and will recommend this product to everyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm completely in love with face scrub. It makes my face feel so clean and soft . I can't believe how smooth it makes my face feel. I'm still working on my 30 day trial but all of the products by L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal that I've been using, including the daily moisturizer, the face scrub, the peel pads, and the nighttime dual overnight cream is just amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way is feels on my face, and it doesn't leave a film on my face. It has all the things I look for in a good facial wash, It has very tiny grains making it gentle for my sensitive skin, with enough texture to actually feel it working. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried the day and night Mosturizer. I really like it. My skin is smooth and no longer dry. It is also a huge plus that there is SPF 30 in the day Mosturizer so I don't have to apply any sunscreen to my face! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have VERY sensitive, combination, acne-prone skin and rosacea and this product seemed to increase break-outs and did not help with redness. Might work better on someone with less-sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product works great. It smells good and the scrubbing granules clean but aren't too abrasive. When I've used similar products in the past it's dried out my skin and turned it red. This cleanser doesn't do that and even made my skin feel more moisturized. I'm very happy with the results and can definitely see fine lines and wrinkles disappearing.

"From day one after using this product, my skin felt AMAZING!! Living in Vegas, the air quality and the sun do a number on your skin, but it's been a 6 days using this and I'll definitely continue after the 30 days are up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the smell and texture of the Daily Scrub. However, on 2 separate occasions different friends asked if I was feeling ok. My skin looks pasty and breaks out in zits leaving me looking sickly. After the second friend asked what was wrong after I had just gotten finished washing my face I discontinued use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Hey so I tried this for free!!! I used the Loreal Bright Reveal Daily Scrub. Originally I felt the difference. My face was brighter. However by the third day I had hives. Now my face is peeling. Not good for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got to try this product for free thanks to L'Oreal Paris I loved this product I noticed that my skin was smoother day 1 after 1 week my skin was brighter and after 2 weeks my family and friends noticed it too I love this product. It was so easy to find the time for this each day too important for a busy mom who has time for that it needs to work for me and fit into my busy life too.

"I think that the L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is awesome.. After about only a week of using my skin was clear , clean and fresh.. I actually had people at work come up to me and ask me what i had been using on my skin as it looked so clear .. I was kinda shocked that it had made such a noticeable difference .. I now have much more confidence then i did before.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had the opportunity to use L'Oréal Revitalift Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser when L'Oréal Paris gave me the product to try for free, and I loved it! The cleanser has tiny microbeads that exfoliate without scratching, and it is easy to rinse off without any residue. My skin feels clean and vibrant after use, without any tightness or dryness.

I absolutely love this product! I was able to try this product thanks to BzzAgent for free. I was able to tell my friends how well this product worked for me. I actually had friends ask me what facial products I was using because my skin was glowing. I love how light L'Oreal products feel going on your face. I felt like the daily brightening product really helped me feel more confident and made me smile! Will be a new customer. Thank you!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ok, so I normally don't like this stuff. Too many steps that never really gave me results. But THIS did!!! I stopped using it for 1 day, and I swear my skin was crying. So easy to use, feels light and my skin is so soft, even and bright! I've had people ask me if I've gone in for a chemical peel. I'm happy to tell them nope, I had a better treatment! #brightreveal from #lorealparisUSA #igotitfree [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I must say that I was a little nervous about trying L'Oreal revitalize. I have very sensitive skin, so trying something new was a little scary. However, I must say I am glad I tried. This product is awesome. I am just close to my thirty days challenge and my skin looks great. It has actually help with the redness I normally have aND even helped minimized my pores.

"I have been using my L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for about 2 weeks now. I use it every morning and night prior to my other Revitalift products. The scrub is great. It has little ""scrubbers"" in it that make my face feel super clean, and I like the light, fresh scent. I'm not sure my skin is any more radiant or bright, but I am definitely enjoying using the collection and would use again. I received this product free from BzzAgent and L'Oreal.

"Loreal revitalift brightening daily scrub cleanser works great for my skin. I feel like it really deep cleans away all my makeup, dirt, and oil from the day. It doesn't dry my skin out like other cleansers do. My face feels smooth and soft after washing. I really do feel like my face looks brighter and less dull after using this cleanser. It's great. I received this product for free from Loreal Paris. Thank you Loreal! I'm definitely a fan! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product consistently once a day for the last 2 weeks. I believe that the best benefit of this product is it gentle to moderate exfoliation. I also really enjoyed the smell. It left my combination skin feeling smooth and clean but I needed to decrease use from twice to once a day because my cheeks were becoming overly dry. I received this product for free from L'Oréal Paris for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was so fortunate that L'Oreal Paris selected me to test out their Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for free because not much impresses me in the way of facial cleansers. I have two others I do use but this blew both away. Immediately when applying and scrubbing on my face, I could feel my skin exfoliating in the most amazing way. I will never go back to my other two brands again when it comes to facial cleanser. This far exceeded my expectations. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that this scrub is not only effective in cleansing away old skin cells to reveal fresh bright skin, but also the results are immediate and only get better as you continue to use the product. Even better, the scrub does what it is intended to do, but does so gently, so it can be a part of a daily skin care routine. I am very happy with this entire skin care line, and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a daily skin care line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This stuff is great.It has a light fresh scent, and those little beads sure scrub my pores!!! My face felt very soft and clean after using the scrub.

"I love the cleanser so far, I can clearly see the difference in freshness and my skin feels good.One thing is I wish it was in a different kind of bottle like soap dispenser instead of in a tube. It will be easier to use it that way [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"L'Oreal's Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is awesome! There is just the right amount of the little micro scrubbers in the cleanser. Enough to removed makeup and dead skin but not so much that it would irritate my skin. My face felt fresh and clean after using. The added Glycolic Acid, Pro-Retinol® and Vitamin C make it that much better than any other good ""scrubber"". [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really love this L'Oreal Daily Scrub Cleanser. It doesn't make my face feel dry or dull, and it is really light-weight for a scrub. After using it just the first time, I noticed how smooth and silky my face felt. Plus the fragrance is very light, which is good for allergies. So far, it hasn't caused any breakouts on my acne-prone skin (after 2-weeks use). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I actually used all products sent as directed. I wasn't sure of the pads as the first day I got a burning sensation all over my face which went to a tingling sensation on day number 2. By the time I got to the 3 day everything felt normal. Noticed results within the first week & love how beautiful & brighter I looked. Love it all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
L'Oréal sent me a free L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. This cleanser deeply cleans my face leaving it soft and brighter but it doesn't over dries my skin. After trying this amazing cleanser I definitely don't want to use other brands to clean my face. The best part is that it is not expensive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like using the daily scrub. It made my face feel clean and soft. The only thing I don't like about using it you have to watch being in the sun without sunscreen. They did give me daily moisturizer that had sunscreen in it to try also. I would recommend using the whole line for anyone wanting help with younger looking skin. I received this product for free from L'Oreal Paris for testing and reviewing purposes only. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It has been just over a week since I started using the entire L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection. I am highly impressed with the results so far.

I have been using this cleanser every morning and I have not had any acne or blackhead issues at all. My skin is nice and smooth. I love the aroma. It is a light soft clean aroma.

"The Daily Scrub Cleanser is great! I use it at night to clean my face before bed. I can feel the tiny little scrubbers getting all the makeup, dirt, and dead skin off my face. My skins feels fresh and bright. It's also very smooth. What a difference and it's only been two weeks. This product will definitely be part of my daily routine for now on.

"I received the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser in exchange for my honest review. It is a great scrub! I used it both with my Clarisonic and without. Many products work with WITH the Clarisonic, but I was impressed with how exfoliated and clean I felt even when using it without. I would definitely buy it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the daily scrub both with my Clarisonic and without. Many products do a good job in conjunction with the Clarisonic, but I was really impressed on how well the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser did on its own. I felt both clean and exfoliated! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think these products are just amazing. I really was wanting to try them and I'm so glad I did. I am going to continue to buy this. My skin feels and looks so much better.

"I""m usually loyal to my skincare routine but when I was offered this L'Oreal skincare product to try, I couldn't resist. I'm glad I did! My skin looked brighter after one use! I could not believe it! The exfoliating granules are very tiny and mild. They are not over drying or rough on my skin. I feel like the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is definitely a product I will keep using and recommend to friends!

"I was really excited about trying a product that promised to even my skin tone and improve my complexion. After the first few days I found that the skin on my cheeks was getting redder and redder. I tried decreasing my use to once a day instead of two, but after almost two weeks of use the problem continued and I finally discontinued using the product.

"I was excited to try this L'Oreal Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleaner, so that was the first thing I did when I got into the shower after receiving my Bzzkit.

After drying off my face, it felt clean and soft and ready to take on the day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using many scrubs and hating them because I would break out more, I was a bit hesitant to try the Loreal Revitalift scrub. But let me tell you am I glad that I did!! This is it! I finally found something that will remove all the dead skin and yet not strip my face to wear I break out or am too sensitive. This was a perfect balance. I saw immediate results from how soft my face felt, kept me wanting more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think that I really want these spots and fine lines to fade away peacefully to the land of far and farther away..ha ha. I tried for free from my new bzzagent the new line from Loreal Paris revitalift scrub. It was clear with tiny pearl like beads and it went on smooth, was a nice feel while gently scrubbing. My skin felt smooth and soft and hoping to see difference. Really liking it with first time use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am loving the Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser with Glycolic Acid. I am skeptical to try new things at first- but I always choose a cleanser with an exfoliating component. I like that the cleanser is gentle, but still makes my skin feel smooth after use. L'Oreal does not disappoint! In one week, I've noticed my skin looking brighter and smoother and can't wait to see the difference after 30 days! For now, here is my ""before"" picture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the daily scrub cleanser everyday and I really like it. My face feels firmer and smoother. I also had dry patches that have disappeared since I started using it. I do actually think there is a new shine in my cheeks. I am using the entire collection and love it. I will continue with using this cleanser after the sample is gone, it works very well.

"I really liked the texture with the micro pearls of the Brightening Daily scrub cleanser, it made my skin feel super clean.

"First off, I received the product for free from L'Oréal Paris. I used it right away, excitedly. I love the citrus scent. I love the way it feels while using. I did not notice some great benefit after continued use, BUT my skin was clean and felt clean, and that's what a cleanser does. Brighter? Nah. Cleaner? Yup! I like the little scrubber ""beads"". If the price was right I would continue use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I liked this product. However, I think that I need something that is designed to control acne as well. I am 35 and lines/wrinkles are a concern for me. I do still have the occasional pimple, though, and noticed that my skin was less clear while using this product. I would stick with this as long as I also keep something in my regime that controls oil and breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

However, when I used the first amount, rubbing it into my hands, I immediately felt the scrubbing bubbles going to work with a rich lather! Look at my photo, see those bubbles?

I have just started on my 30-Day Challenge of the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal collection. I have had several days of using the Daily Scrub Cleanser. It definitely has some exfoliating properties without being too harsh. I have some summer grit and sun un evenish to get worked out. I see some evidence of improvements. Some of the dark blotches are evening out. It feels refreshing!! I look forward to using it each evening! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this morning and night. It has delicate but effective little beads that exfoliate and get into those pours. It doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy or dried out. I really like it! My husband has also been using it and loves how it doesn't irritate his skin after shaving. Great product that has even better results. I will be using this even after the campaign is over.

"I was a little hesitant to try L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Cleanser at first because I have very sensitive skin and break out horrible when I change anything about my skincare. I have been using it for a week now and I have to say I'm VERY impressed with it!!!! No breakouts at all! In fact my skin looks better than ever! It appears clearer, smooth, brighter and even more youthful! Not what I expected at all. It is by far the best cleanser I have ever used! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

It rinses off very easily, ( some cleansers don't) and leaves my skin feeling very clean and fresh. I'm already a big fan. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I really love the daily scrub. I have had trouble in the past with face wash that has the ""beads"" in it but these seem to dissolve when I'm washing. I have not found the product to be too harsh as some can. The scent is light and, in only a couple of weeks, I can already see improvement to the texture and brightness of my face! I did receive a free product from L'Oreal Paris but my opinions are genuine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love using a scrub to cleanse my congested skin; however, I usually find them too drying / irritating for everyday use. I have been using L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser twice a day since receiving it from buzz agent. My skin looks and feels so clean and refreshed after using it. Continued use has made a huge difference in my skin tone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like this scrub in general. It is coarse enough to help exfoliate my skin, but I think it might also be a little too textured. I have been using it for about a week now, and I find I can only use it once a day. I tried using it twice and it was too strong for my skin. I experienced a little skin irritation, but it went away when I cut down to once a day. I will continue with the 30 day challenge and hope that I grow use to the texture.

"This is a great daily scrub, I have been using it morning and night and can feel that my skin is smoother and more even in just a week. I really like how gently but effective this scrub is, my skin is pretty sensitive and I haven't had any problems so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub has a light citrus smell that is refreshing. It lightly exfoliates and is gentle on my skin creating a smooth, even-tone all over. After one week of using all the L'Oreal Revitalift products, my skin has never looked better. I will definitely be adding this to my line of face products! Thank you L'Oreal Paris for my free Revitalift Bright Reveal collection! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love love love this product. I work out a ton and I am absolutely OCD about keeping my skin fresh and clean. I love the way this cleanser feels as you are using it and I LOVE the way that it feels after. Smooth, fresh and SO ridiculously clean. No offensive smell. Great texture. No artificial colors. Just love everything about this. Also...most scrub like cleansers leave a residue of some sort...this washes off COMPLETELY. Nice and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I noticed a difference right away, my skin looked brighter, cleaner, even had a glow. It wasn't rough on my skin and didn't feel like sandpaper like others on the market. After a couple of weeks I noticed my foundation went on smoother and didn't look like it was caking in my creases. I will continue to buy this scrub, very impressed! I received my product from L'Oreal to sample and review for other consumers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. I felt like it was really sloughing off all my dead skin when I scrubbed. My face felt brighter and tighter. This is a great product and so easy to use. I saw results in just a few days. The cleanser also smells nice, not too perfumey or strong. Just a fresh clean scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this scrub. It makes my face feel new and clean. It really feels like it is getting not only the makeup off but truly getting below the surface and taking off all the old dead skin cells. Since using this product I have also noticed that my pores look dramatically smaller and my dace looks clearer and more even. It is my new go to scrub.

"All the products in the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal collection are great. The daily scrub smell so light and clean. It cleans well, rinses away easily and isn't harsh on my skin. My pores look smaller, my dark spots are getting lighter, my skin is so much softer and smoother and my makeup goes on so much nicer all thanks to the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal collection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have added this scrub to my daily routine and I love it. I also used this to exfoliate my chest and shoulders when I had a slight sunburn. It took 2 days of using this scrub and it took away all my dead skin. My skin is really soft and smooth. What you would want to know before you get this product is how it feels on your skin. The micro beads glide on and feel like they instantly exfoliate and smooth your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I just started using the cleanser a few days ago, it seems to clean well without drying my skin out. I tend to have sensitive skin but this didn't irritate it. Still early in the trial I will keep using for more results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the L'Oreal Bright Reveal Daily Scrub is a great product. I have been consistently using it for a week now and my skin has never looked better. It has minimized my pores. My skin, definitely looks brighter. I have used many other brands of scrubs and this particular one ranks up there. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The cleanser is the best thing I've ever used and I'm not exaggerating. It makes my face feel really smooth and it really does brighten your skin. I saw results within in day. I'm extremely satisfied with this product and I can't wait to buy more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using the daily scrub for about a week now. I was a little worried about trying a new product but so far it's been working great. I really like the refreshing scent it has not to prowler full like other products I have tried. No resido left behind either. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really love this cleanser. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and smooth. The scrub helps my skin feel so much softer too. This is great when used before the other Revitalift products. My skin is sensitive too and it didn't irritate or bother my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product free from L'Oreal Paris in exchange for my honest review. I have been using this product for about a week now consistently and I love the way it makes my skin feel.

I am so glad that I was able to try the L'oreal revitalift collection for free! These products are absolutely amazing! I love all of these products. The brightening daily scrub cleanser is wonderful. It cleans and exfoliates wonderfully and leaves my skin radiant and glowing! I lIke the fact that it exfoliates and contains glycolic acid. I love that it was very effective but did not irritate my skin! It has drastically improved my skin tone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved the free sample of Loreal Rivitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser I received from Loreal. My face felt so awesome after using...the frangrance wasnt over the top. My face felt so much cleaner and had such a glow to it. Really loved it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser from BzzAgent. However, this cleanser is not for me. My skin is sensitive, so I thought the scrub along with glycolic acid is too much for my skin. I did try this wash once, and my skin was peeling the next day. I prefer to do a manual scrub just a couple times a week, and separate my glycolic acid treatment. I would think this dual exfoliation would be too much for most people. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had the opportunity to try L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser and am very happy with it! My skin looks much better after this cleanser. It is so smooth. The product has a nice smell and doesn't leave a residue. I really like this scrub. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I LOVE this cleanser! It has tiny little scrubbing beads in it that seem to individually scrub each of my pores clean. The scent is very inviting and my skin feels very soft after using. The soap lathers up very nicely and it washes off well too.

"I had the opportunity to try L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser as a bzz agent and am completely wowed! My skin looks and feels amazing after just one use with this cleanser. Never has any other cleanser made my skin feel so silky smooth. I love how it goes one, it doesn't have strong ordors, and feels very natural. It truly lives up to its name and left my skin feeling vibrant and clear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Brightening Daily Scrub cleanser is a great daily cleanser. I have been using this cleanser in the morning and at night and every time I use it my skin is noticeably brighter and feels very soft and silky. My skin tone appears more even and my face just feels healthier overall. There is no dryness or tight feeling after using it like I get with some other cleansers. I would highly recommend this cleanser.

I love the new L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening product line! L'Oreal sent me the full line to try and I love them all! It's hard to pick one favorite!

"Scrub Cleanser it contain micro-pearls that gently exfoliate your skin, it has an acid aroma (I love it) It doesn't feel like a soap, you can control when you apply it to your face, it doesn't go into your eyes, it's easy to rinse. After you use it you feel your skin brighter, fresher, and more radiant, and leave your skin ready to moisturizer and after weeks of using it I feel my skin with an even tone and smother. Is going to last 1 month if you use it two times per day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved this cleanser, you could really feel the beads scrubbing your face leaving it actually clean and breezy. I like after I washed and dried my face I could feel it clean and was soft to the touch, not only the brightness it showed was more refined and upbeat.

I think I am in love with this scrub....it is so gentle and has lil micro scrubbers....and it smells amazing!!!!! I LOVE L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal and I am so happy that I got it FREE from L'Oréal Paris...this company is amazing and makes awesome products.....nothing better then word of mouth advertising and they know what they are doing with this product. It is so creamy and light and in just a few days I am beginning to see a difference!! AWESOME [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this product for free from Loreal Paris to try. Unfortunately after a few uses my skin reacted to it. This is probably not the typical persons response to the product but I have very sensitive skin. I will say for the few days I used it that it leaves your skin feeling very clean and refreshed, and it does have an exfoliator in it. It also has a pleasant smell. I would have liked to continued use of the product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It's been a week now and just wonderful to see my skin glow. My skin feels smooth, clean, hydrated and smells great. Used about a dime sized amount as it makes a lot of foam. The glycolic fights to fade spots and the exfoliating micro beads are gentle and rises off easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this cleanser. The only drawback I have is having to use a separate eye makeup remover with it. My skin feels so smooth afterwards. I can really tell the micro-beads are exfoliating my skin, but it's very gentle. Price-wise I feel like this is a great value and I will repurchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is great. I recommended it to all my friends and family. I enjoyed this product most in the morning. It made my face feel so clean and refreshed. This was different from other products because it didn't make my face feel dry and it didn't make it too oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After trying the L'Oreal Rivitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser that I received for free, I felt that my skin was the cleanest it has been in a while. The product scrubs your face but doesn't irritate it. I like that you can actually feel the scrubbing verses massaging like other products do. I want a deep clean, not a simple facial massage and this product delivers that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have try L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Cleanser all i have too say is WOW i put it on mine face and it feel very smooth and very very easy too follow the direction it is truely amazing and i would buy this product again. Very Very happy with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have really enjoyed using the daily scrub cleanser. The exfoliating bits are super fine. I admit I was nervous about the word glycolic ""acid"" in my cleanser, but I have had no negative effects of that. On the contrary, my complexion has definitely been improved, my skin less dull and it feels really, really clean."
I received this product free for review but opinions expressed are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the product from L'Oreal Paris to try at no cost, just my opinion. I have tried many other facial scrubs and this one is on par with the others I have tried. My face felt clean, there was no residue or tightness felt on my skin. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
THANK YOU LOREAL PARIS FOR SENDING ME THIS WONDERFUL SCRUB TO TRY FOR FREE THROUGH Buzzagent. It works like a charm makes my skin baby butt smooth. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TRY YOUR LIFE OF PRODUCTS. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think that the cleanser is already helping to improve my skin. After using it my skin feels so clean! I have only been using the products for about a week and I think I'm going to be very happy with them because I can already see improvement in my skin.

I recently tried L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. As an every day scrub it worked really well. It left my face feeling clean and bright. There was no residue or makeup left when I was finished washing my face. Great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked using this cleanser. It is creamy and soft with a light scent. You don't need to use much, a little goes a long way. I especially like that it rinses clean and leaves my skin feeling clean and soft but not stripped. I think it's a great cleanser to use in the summer time. Although I've been using it for over a week I can't tell if it is brightening my skin. I received this product to try for my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Smells great, feels even better! Leaves your face silky soft and refreshed. When you are using it you can feel all the particles cleaning your face and working out all the impurities. Just feels fabulous. Light and creamy, easy to work around your face. I love to use this before bed as it is like treating yourself to small face massage before you drift off. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this product free from L'Oreal Paris to try, I have used it for about 15 days and I really like it. The first time I used too much, you only need a pea size amount to cleanse your entire face and it rinses off very easily with no residue. The L'Oreal Daily Scrub Cleanser leaves your face feeling clean without feeling like all the moisture is stripped. I like this product a lot and it works well with the rest of the line. The scrub is the 1st step I use morning and night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just received my L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal collection free from L'Oreal and used it for the first time yesterday. I am pretty skeptical about using over-the-counter/store products. So far, the product has been good and my skin feels great! I actually have used all of the four products and am excited to see what my skin looks like after one week! If this product works like it says it should, I may be switching from my normal skin-care routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed this product because it was not harsh on my skin. Everything smell nice. I was surprise how easy to steps were to use the day and night cream. I love the package of the L'Oreal Paris Recitalift products [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love the cleanser! It exfoliates without being to rough on the skin. I can already tell the difference after three days. Can not wait to see my skin after the complete thirty days of the challenge! This product is totally worth it! I will continue to purchas after I run out of what I have. It is a scrubber, when I was expecting a regular cleanser, but I am happy I tried it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the Daily Scrub Cleanser. I have used Aveeno scrub cleanser in the past. Loreal's scrub cleanser left my face feeling smooth and soft. This is a great product that I will definitely be purchasing. I received this product as a sample from BzzAgent. I will be using this free product and will definitely be purchasing this product as my scrub cleanser from now on. Great product!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"So I don't normally use face scrubs. I just don't like how they feel on my face. But the new Revitalift scrub from L'Oréal gave me a change of heart. After just a few scrubs, my face feels so much smoother. I got this product for free from L'Oréal to try for unbiased opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tried the entire line I received from L'Oreal for free for unbiased product reviews. While I initially liked the product, I think it's to harsh to use on my sensitive skin every day, a few times a week would probably be what my skin can tolerate. My skin was red after using this a few mornings in a row. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this scrub from L'Oreal Revitalift. I am really picky about my skin care routine. It is nice to switch it up once in a while and I was glad #BzzAgent sent this to me to try for free. #gotitfree
"The smell is nice and the feel is gritty, just the way I like it. I am impressed with L'Oreal's claim that I will be able to notice a difference in 1 day because the product held true to it's word. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
What would I want to know before I got this product is does it really work. Well I have been using it now for a week and I can already see a difference in my skin. It's very bright my wrinkles around my eyes are fading I will cintinue to use this product for the 30 day challenge [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I enjoyed my experience with L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Bright Reveal. I just used my in the shower and washed my face with it, instead of my bar of soap. I loved the feel of the micro beads extrapolating my skin, but I do wonder if they are environmentally friendly. My skin felt clean and fresh after each shower. It has a nice clean, citrus scent to it that is very pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After using this product for few days I will start with the good. This product is a great facial scub. The scrub has tiny particles that really give you a micro massage. It removes all dead skin cells and leaves your skin feeling shiney & smooth. The only this that I disliked is that it recommends you use in morning & at night and my face is sensitive so I was unable to do twice a day after the first three days. I got this product for free from L'Oréal Paris to give an honest reveiw. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. It gave my face a good deep down clean. After using for awhile my face looks really clean and smooth.

Wow the look on my face when I used loreal Paris Revitalift Collection was amazing. I received this item for free from L'Oréal and used it for a week and it was totally amazing .

"I have to state that I was ver pleasantly surprised. This scrub works wonderful, especially with my Clinique scrubber. It left me feeling clean and fresh and helped my complection. I also noticed that my face seemed brighter. I even had my husband try it and he is a fan of it as well, and it has helped him reduce his ingrown hairs. I would recommend this for both men and women who are looking to being a youthful glow back to their face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think the L'Oreal Daily Scrub cleanser has the perfect amount of microbeads for gentle everyday use. I have been using it day and night for 3 days and it has awesome. I can instantly feel a cleaner and softer face after each use. I would definitely say I see a brighter complexion after less than a weeks use. My skin feels very refreshed also. I would definitely buy this and use it in addition to my other facial cleanser as this one has Glycolic Acid to help reveal more radiant skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think I'm hooked on this stuff. This is Revitalift Bright Reveal Night. Before bed; wash your face, use a Bright Reveal Peel Pad, let your face dry and put on the NIGHT! A little goes a long way girls. This makes your face feel hydrated and has an almost matt finish. Look in the mirror because you look great before bed."
This is a must have. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this Brightning Daily Scrub Cleanser is good. I have semi sensitive skin so I myself can't use an exfoliating cleanser due to the micro-pearls on a daily basis. I've used it once so far and it really feels great. The smell is fresh and light. For those of you who can use a facial scrub daily, I would recommend this new product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

It has little beads in it to make you really feel like you are getting a clean face! My face felt much cleaner after using the daily scrub both in the morning and the night. I am taking the 30 day challenge to see how my face looks and feels after 30 days. If it is anything like how it feels now, the scrub is going to be a keeper for me!

I love this scrub! After only 3 days of use my face is much smoother. A small amount is enough for your entire face and it rinses off easily. Out of all of the products from my kit this scrub is my favorite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Today is the first full day I have used the products. The cleansing pads are already a fav. I've been concerned lately about whether my cleanser is working. The pads offer another level of cleaning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was excited to try the Daily Scrub Cleanser because I like L'Oreal's products in general. The scrub went on my face really easily and it had a nice fragrance to it.

"Using this product, I think it's okay. It is very similar to other products on the market. I will use it however I don't know if I would buy it. It does have a pleasant scent.

I started using the product as soon as I received it .. It only took a little bit to use .. It was awesome!! After I used it my face felt so smooth and soft then I put the L'Oreal day cream on and applied my make-up.

"The cleanser felt good on my skin. I used it in the shower mostly, on my face and back. It does its job. I'm not super wow by it since it's very difficult to tell this apart from other top-line cleanser. The packaging is nice. Not sure if I will invest in this one since I don't detect a significant difference compared to other cleansers on the market. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was skeptical before using this cleanser. It claimed that it did many things that my skin needed! Well I can tell you it does live up to the advertisements! My skin was instantly softer and more supple! In the next few days I noticed more pliable and toned skin. My skin looks refreshed and renewed. I'm really enjoying this cleanser!!!

"I think this is a pretty good cleanser if you want noticeably smoother and softer skin. It's one of those cleansers with those ""beads' that give it a gritty texture. My skin is oily, sensitive and acne prone and this cleanser did not aggravate any of those issues. It just made it feel softer and smoother. Thanks for letting me try L'Oreal!

"First and foremost, thanks to L'Oreal for the opportunity of trying these products! I have been using this cleanser for about two weeks now and I just love it!

"I have been using the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for about a week and a half now. I do believe I have seen an improvement in my darker sun spots, they are beginning to not jump out at me as much as they did before. I really enjoy the scent of the cleanser and the way it makes my skin feel afterwords, soft and not dry and tight. I am hoping to see even more improvement the longer I use it.

The L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser is such a miracle worker. I have been using it for about 10 days and I have already noticed that my skin is brighter and my sun spots are fading! I would highly recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received a free set of L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal and included was the Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. I use this in the shower and it makes my skin feel great! It exfoliates wonderfully and doesn't leave my skin feeling raw. It's the best yet! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this daily cleanser. I use it once in the morning (pre-shower) and once at night (pre-bed) and I can really feel/see a difference in my skin. The difference is immediate too! Super easy to use and well worth the extra couple of minutes each day. My skin is brighter and softer after just a few days of using this product. I am very happy with the results and will continue to use it and recommend it to all of my friends. Thank you L'Oreal Paris for the free product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been using the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser for almost 2 weeks now and so far I am pleased. I do believe my skin seems brighter and smoother, but the results are not major at this point. My first thought when using it was that the ""scrubbers"" in the cleanser were not small enough to exfoliate well but that doesn't appear to be the case and the exfoliation is good without being too harsh on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this cleanser at night to remove make-up and daily grime. I like it because it gently exfoliates and gets rid of dead skin making my skin feel soft. It removes make-up well and also rinses off with no residue. I received this product for free from L'Oreal Paris in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this scrub for a week now and it is really good. It does not dry your skin out and it gets your face shiny clean. I got this free product from L'Oréal Paris to try and have already recommended it to numerous people. The product is a good size to boot !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the products that I got for free from L'Oréal are awesome. I have used it for about a week now. My skin is so soft. I use the scrub in the morning and then I put the brightening day moisturizer on before my makeup. I use the brightening pads at night after my face is clean then I apply the dual overnight moisturizer. I love the way it makes my face feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the L'Oréal Revitalift Bright Reveal Daily Scrub Cleanser for about two weeks instead of my usual. I like this scrub quite a bit, it leaves my skin feeling refreshed. While I haven't noticed anything dramatic, it does help keep my skin clean and bright. The scrubbing power is pretty gentle. However, it comes out of the bottle very quickly. Still, I would recommend it. I received this free in exchange for an honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received the L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser for free from L'Oreal Paris to review. This cleanser is now my go to cleanser.

"I am a member of Buzz agent and I received this product for free in exchange for a honest review. I actually noticed more radiant and smooth skin after first usage. I like the feel of the micro- pearls while massaging the product in my skin, but I am not sure if it's too harsh because I have very oily skin. I think this produces more oil and cause my skin to shine even more. I think other skin types is a better for this type of cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
L'Oreal Revitalift Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub works great. I really like that a small amount of scrub goes a long way. The scrub has a nice smell & feels good while massaging it onto the face. It leaves your face feeling fresh & renewed. The product makes your face glow beautifully. This scrub is top knotch and I have shared by experience with several of my girlfriends. L'Oreal did an amazing job formulating this scrub. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using all 4 products for the last 5 days the Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser has the right amount of exfoliating scrubbers, after washing my face it looked so much brighter and felt extremely smooth. I have big pores on my face and this scrub leaves my poor looking very clean, usually after washing my face with other cleanser I feel as if my pores looked more clogged but not with Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser, my face looked very clean. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is a good product after use my skin felt clean and soft and smooth the only thing that I didn't like is the exfoliate little white beads they were hard to get off my face after i was done wiping my face and putting on a moisterizer I still had the beads on my face other than that I really liked it.

"I could tell an immediate difference after using the facial cleanser. It has tiny little salt-like grains in it to gently exfoliate your skin. It smells amazing, sort of like oranges and my skin was immediately brighter and softer. Awesome. I wet my face and applied the cleanser with my fingers, gently rubbing until clean and then rinsed and blotted dry. I applied the daily spf moisturizer after but my skin was noticeably brighter and softer following the cleanser. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm a soap and water girl and it's worked fine for the last few years. That is until L'Oréal Paris sent me their Bright Reveal Brightening Daily Scrub Cleanser. They first night I tried it I could tell such a difference in my face. My skin felt cleaner, softer and looked smoother. I'm hooked. After using the cleanser for a week even my family noticed a difference. I will never go back to soap and water again!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the light citrus scent is amazing!! Not overpowering at all. Being 41 my skin care routine needed a wake up call. This Loreal line is perfect.

Love the scrubbing beads in the Cleanser to really give my skin that deep clean without being too harsh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have really enjoyed this product. It has a citrus scent that is energizing!

Thank You L'Oreal for sending me this free product to try. I LOVE IT!!!! My skin has never felt so soft and smooth.

"I have only have used the scrub for about a week, but i am feeling a tightness to my face. My face seems to have less big pores. I will do the 30 challenge and am expecting awesome results.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Tried the Daily Scrub Cleanser and instantly felt it working. The tiny beads exfoliated the entire face. Also like it that it's fragrance free. Nice job L'Oréal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
A nice change from my usual gel cleanser. I love the exfoliation and the light citrus smell. I wish it was a little more foamy - but still love the feel when I wash it off! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

We shall see in a week but my skin fills clean and soft and smells good... i looked at the box and did the 3 steps... hahaa [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought this product at a local cvs. It coar way more than they are selling it on line. I used this product for a week and started noticing that the areas around my lips were really dried. And turning red. I had to stop using this product as i am probably allergic to what was in there. I love loreal products but this on i can no longer use. Wish i could get my money back.
Not too heavy - does not cause breakouts but leaves a clean fresh feeling. Just wish Walmart sold in stores and not just online!
"I use this twice daily ,it keeps my skin bright n soft w/o breaking the bank"
I have been using it for a few weeks now and my skin is noticeably more clear. I am a huge fan and will continue purchasing the Revitalift...
