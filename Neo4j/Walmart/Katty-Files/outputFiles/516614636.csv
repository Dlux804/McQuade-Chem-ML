"At first this seems like other SPF moisturizers - my previous buys have been based on which brand is on sale because they all seem similar. I live at high altitude and having aging skin, so I never leave the house without sunscreen. However, this product makes my skin look better - it seems to have a way of reflecting light that makes wrinkles and discolorations (aka ""age spots"") less noticeable. I have actually received compliments about my skin."
I Would love to try this product because it helps with my really bad sunburns [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved Olay Luminous Brightening and Protecting Lotion SPF 30 from my daughter as a gift and I loved it! Easy to apply, made my skin look and feel great. Olay Luminous Brightening and Protecting Lotion SPF 30 also had a very pleasant smell. I would definitively recommend!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Other broad spectrum SPF face creams I have tried have been heavy and feel a bit uncomfortable on my skin,but this cream is light and leaves no heavy feel. I love that! And it does the job of protecting my skin from the sun. I have worn it at the beach, and when out for day trips, and just for everyday. There is never any sign of the sun affecting my face. I also really think that it does make my skin look brighter. This is definitely my new go to product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is good to apply prior to makeup application. It's not too heavy and not too thin. It does add a luminous glow to the skin. I have a few dark spots on my forehead that seem to be fading since using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product. Don't know that I can afford to actually purchase it but I love it. Face is soft and clear and skin is protected and supple. I would recommend this to any one that can afford to buy it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I bought this to lighten some dark spots on my fave. I have been using it and havent noticed the slightest change. Not going to buy again.
"I tried this in the past, but did not continue using it. I tried it again recently and it reminded me that this product works. My skin tone became more even. Olay, it would be much appreciated if you can make a fragrance free version of this as well as oxybenzone free for those of us who are sensitive. I feel like I am spreading perfume on my face, and the smell lingers throughout the day, so as much as I like this product, sadly I do not know if I can use it long term."
"I tried this not sure what to expect, was very pleased with how much smoother and lighter under my eyes look. I typically use a concealer over it but even If I don't have time I don't see the darkness under the eye as much as before [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have no idea what is supposed to happen. It's small for the price (this is not a criticism on Walmart per se, probably the MSRP). Ya not buy again because for that price I buy a name brand at Macy's."
"Product absorbed quickly and my face feels a little softer. Only used it for a week and a half so far, so have not noticed a change in dark spots. I prefer products with little or no fragrance and this one has a bit much for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for a little over a week. It is a terrific moisturizer. My skin looks and feels better; more even skin tone and brighter. I appreciate the SPF 30 since I live in the mountains and the UV is quite harsh. No other moisturizing product is needed. It costs a pretty penny but many good facial products do.

"It is a good moisturizer. I just did not see a lot of skin brightening. Initially it didn't seem to be readily absorbed. When I the put on make up I seemed oily looking. I don't want a dry look, but this was more than dewy. Will continue to use as it does seem to moisturize my neck and chest quite well. Did not seem as ""crepey"" after using for a week. Unless I see more of an improvement, I would feel that the price would be more than I would want to spend for a moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really haven't used the product long enough yet to comment on fading dark spots or brightening skin tone. I do find that the texture when applied seems to absorb into my skin really fast leaving my skin with a dry feeling. I'll see what happens over the coming weeks.

"The Luminous Broad Spectrum with SPF 30 feels wonderful on my face. When I put it on it feels like I am putting pure cream on my face, goes on smoothly and when I feel my face later it feels smooth and refreshing. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends to try, and I know they will love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay Luminous Brightening and Protection Lotion feel great on my face. The lotion is very creamy and goes on so smoothly. I love the glow it gives your skin without feeling or looking greasy. The sun protection is an added bonus! I highly recommend this product for daily usage.P [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love that this product has SPF 30! I am a leukemia and stem cell transplant survivor who takes immune suppressant drugs and must wear nothing less than SPF 30. All of my products are Olay brand. Thank you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I normally use serums, especially in summer to avoid breakouts . This product is creamy but very light. My skin looks and feels moisturized. Not greasy at all. I will be using now as part of my regimen. Smells good too, no strong fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is lightweight and absorbs quickly. The smell is quite nice too. I'm still undecided if it's fading my sunspots since I've only been using it for 1 week. It's a bit pricey for my budget but if it works the way it claims to it will be worth the cost. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like the fact that this product lightens dark spots and protects your skin from the sun. It doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy like some creams after use and it moistures your skin deeply. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Not thick like CeraVe Facial Moisturizing Lotion Broad spectrum sunscreen SPF 30. Still researching the different sunscreen ingredients. CeraVe has Niacinamide, which Olay has, also ceramides and hyaluronic acid. Olay has pentapeptides which is important to me. Over all, Olay has another winner with Luminous w/ sunscreen. I will use Luminous to see it's effect over time. I was pretty giddy after seeing the sample you sent! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
