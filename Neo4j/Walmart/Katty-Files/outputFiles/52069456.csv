"I've used this facial cleanser for a few years and really like it. It has a nice, fresh scent. It keeps my pores clean by eliminating blackheads and exfoliating the skin. I don't know about the anti-aging part. I'm 39 and look 29, or so I'm told. Lastly as an animal rights activist I appreciate Peter Thomas Roth's dedication to not testing on animals. I recommend this product!"
It takes a week or so for my skin to adjust to the exfoliants (I have very sensitive skin) but it works very well after that with regular use and smells amazing.
Skin feels so clean and tight after wash. I love it!
Seems to smooth lines as well as leaving your face soft. Great purchase. Got here very quickly.
Great so far only been using it for 2 weeks makes my face feel great
