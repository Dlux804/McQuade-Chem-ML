I love the products and I feel it help my skin to stay young looking
I've been using this product for a year now and can see a difference in my skin. Most people don't believe how old I am because my skin looks so good. I only use Strivectin products!
Amazing product! I am using both serum and night cream. My skin is soft as a baby!! So impressed with how great my skin feels and hopeful it will help decrease fine lines.
"this is my second purchase of this product,had been using the advanced retinol intensive night moisturizer for about 2 yrs, which worked wonderfully. I found this product not to be as greasy and it is very easy to apply makeup over it where the other beaded up.Will continue to purchase this product it has decreased my crows feet by 90 percent, with no breakouts or reddened skin. Love it."
"I've been using this serum for about 3 months now and I have to say- it actually works. I started using it to see if I could reduce some of the frown marks I get on my forhead. Using this every morning and evening has 100% reduced the lines. I wish I took a before picture to really see the difference, but I'm going to take one now and see how it looks another 3 months from now with the serum AND advanced night cream. I'll report back!"
"Great product! I recently got ""carded"" because I didn't look 35, I'm 60!"
Been using this product for three months Day and night. Ive seen a significant change within that time. My skin now glows its softer with a more youthful look. I would highly recommend you buy any strivectin product directly from strivectin website. The product I bought in store had a strong bad oder with a lighter color almost like it had been deluded.
"Have been using this serum for over six months because my skin absorbs the concentrate quickly and plumps my skin thus reducing sagging and wrinkles. Moreover, I apply the restorative creme once the serum has been absorbed to improve the overall texture and skin tone."
This product is much better than a similar product that my doctor gave me. I love because it works great and doesn't dry out my face. Use it AM & PM
When I first started using
"Strivectin, I followed the directioms. My skin did not turn red, but it did start peeling off. When I try using it the next time, I will try applying it over my moisturizer to prevent the peeling. So I really can't say yet about the results."
"I have sensitive skin and am finally able to use retinal without looking like a lizard . I love , love, love how my skin looks and feels ."
If your skin is too sensitive for Retin-a this is a great option for daily use. Slower results but no irritation and endless flaking.
I have only been using this for several weeks and so far I am very pleased. My skin looks brighter and I am hoping it will look tighter soon. However I only received one of three of the packets I requested so I have nothing to say about them.
It was time to start a preventative regimen. I started seeing some fine lines...after about 2 weeks of starting this product I look refreshed. LOVE THIS PRODUCT.
"The first several times when I used it, I felt it's burning my face , so I stopped using it for several days. Two days ago, I used it again , I noticed on my face got smoother in the morning. I'm going to continue to use it to see the results ... I feel it works !"
"I purchased the advanced retinol concentrated serum and absolutely love it. I have been using for about a month and my face is smoother looking and brighter. Winkles are smoother. I definitely will continue using because each day, I notice more overall improvement!"
"I was so excited to use this cream and followed the instructions. However, after a few days I had small sores on my face. I stopped the cream for a few days and started again, the little sores returned. They are gone now, but will not use the cream again. Had high hopes, though!!!"
Within a week of using StriVectin's
"Retinol Serum, my skin is glowing and oh, so soft."
I can't do without this serum. It really smooths out the skin texture and wrinkles.
Orders take extremely long to process and delivery is far longer than they say when you order. Order early or risk running out. Very annoying.
This is my second purchase of this serum. It makes my skin so soft and smooth. Many people have asked me what I use on my skin to keep it looking so amazing.
I've been using this product for about 3 weeks. Can only use at night because it's extremely greasy with a very tiny amount. No way can it be worn under make up. So disappointed.
I've used this product for several months and my skin has never looked healthier. It's given me a clearer complexion and softened my wrinkles. Love it!
I bought this serum about 3 weeks ago. It has worked amazingly. My skin looks and feels great. Dark spots/hyper pigmentation have faded almost away. I was impressed with how quickly the product worked. I am a believer.
I have only been using this for less than a month so the jury is still out. I want to give it a chance so will try to update in 60 to 90 days. No negative results so far and hopeful for some improvement in my skin as time goes on. Reasonably priced to try.
Less than a month and the bottle is empty. One once doesn't go very far for so costly product and not really showing a difference. You serum that you used to sell was fantastic bring that one back a few liquid drops worked like magic. This stuff is just high priced face cream and not very effective.
Within a few days of using this I had friends comment how great I looked.
This really sucks your asking how I like it ??? 12/11/18 have not received it.
Only using for about 2 weeks but already seeing a difference on my face.
"Seems to improve skin quality. Doesn't irritate me. I would like to know the % of retinol in the product, though."
I bought one tube a month and a half ago. I love the results so much that I ordered a second tube for my purse.
"Have only been using 2 weeks, but have seen noticeable reduction in fine lines and wrinkles around both eyes and forehead. Absorbs quickly leaving skin soft & supple feeling all day."
"I was so excited to try this product. However, after a few days I started to break out. I do not have skin that is prone to break out at all. I'm very disappointed...."
The Advanced Retinol Serum is very compatible with my make up routine and touch ups throughout the day. Diminishes the lines around my eyes immediately under concealer - no watery or greasy look to powder. It's like a fresh facial mid-day.
I have only been using this for a few weeks but I am very happy with it so far. It makes my skin feel good and I like that it targets more then one thing.
I have been using this about a month and the pores on my face are diminishing and some totally disappearing. Can't wait to see what the next month will bring.
"This product keeps my skin moist and adds to moisture protection when I use the Retinol Day lotion. My skin feels moist for the whole day, even in cold weather."
"I just got this about a month ago and I love it! I have a lot of the other products too, but this is great! It makes my skin feel awesome and it actually glows, but is not greasy!"
"I have been using this now for over a year, and am very pleased with the results. It's extremely to layer with any other moisturizer, day and night. Highly recommend."
"I bought this Serum at Nordstroms on a whim & have been using it for 3 weeks. It has smoothed my wrinkles, improved my skin tone & texture, & even helped with my mild acne. I love the airtight pump packaging. The product has virtually no scent, which is a huge plus to me too. Overall, I will repurchase this product in the future even though it's quite expensive."
"I am so glad to be using this again. I am going to order it this next time. It was an extra boost to the other retinol products. And my skin looked so much better, more even colored, softer and tighter."
"A bit pricey (wish it was lower cost) but just simply put , it works. II started using this again and my skin is so much better all over ! Yeah!!!"
"I bought this product 2 weeks ago and absolutely love it. I'm 64 with great skin and have some deep set wrinkles around my mouth. Right away I noticed the fine lines above and below my lips diminished. My smile lines are diminishing over time as well. I don't know if the deep set lines will diminish, but every thing else is! My skin looks radiant and I can't say enough about this product!"
been using this for a few weeks now and loving it !
It absorbs easily and maintains moisture... Can't wait to see long term results.
I've used this for almost a year and really love it. Ales s big difference in my mouth wrinkles.
I love serums and this has been the best of all the serums I have used in the past many years.
This was my first repurchase of any of the series. It brightened my skin and seems to reduce wrinkles better than others.
I always have used Strivectin products this serum is even a step above. Love the way it makes my skin feel and the results .
I have been using this serum twice daily for approximately a week. I have seem improvement in my skin clarity.
"my skin looks healthy, fresh, smooth, well moisturized, and not dry anymore. I like what I see in the mirror."
"I have been using this serum with the advanced retinol day and night moisturizer for about three weeks. You can feel it working. It has reduced the depth of my ""11"" and forehead lines. I couldn't be happier! Plus, it normalizes the tone, firmness, and pore size of your skin. Great product! Worth every cent :)!!"
Skin texture has improved with just two weeks use !
"New product for me, anxious to see improvement, good pricing."
This product is really worth the money. I love it and would recommend it to anyone
I love this product....I can actually see the difference while I am using it.
Great product I can really see a difference in my skin.
Excellant products. I look 20+ years younger than I am.
I felt difference in just 1 week! :) Really effective!
My second bottle of Advanced Retinol Concentrated Serum.
This serum has become a staple in my skincare routine. I feel like my skin really responds to it.
"I had received a sample of this from a friend a while ago. I noticed a difference right away and before long people were commenting on how wonderful my skin looked! This is the best face product I have ever used, hands down! (Including all creams, serums, etc.) Love!!!"
"I was hesitant when I first got this product but after trying it for a month I already see the difference. My friend came up to me and said ""Your skin looks much better!"". I was like ""Wow no way!""."
I brought this a month ago and I am so happy I did. It really compliments my advance retinol intensive night cream. I have noticed a clear and more radiant complexion and it has minimized the appearance of the fine lines and winkles on my face. My sister is now using it and she loves it as well.
Only using for about 2 months but already seeing a difference on my face.
This is the best retinol product I've tried. Extremely pleased with this serum form.
I absolutely love this product . Im turning 57 and my skin looks better now that it did when I was 45
"I've been using this serum underneath my moisturizer for almost 2 weeks now and I've noticed my skin is more even toned, brighter and looks plumper. This is the first time I've tried anything with Retinol in it and I can see why my derm recommended it for people in their 40s. I've loved the results of this Retinol serum that I've just placed an order for the daytime and nighttime Retinol moisturizers as well. This serum will be a staple in my daily beauty routine."
I using for about 2 months but already seeing a difference on my face.
it's beautiful
I started using Strivectin about 2 months ago and have noticed that my skin looks and feels great. I am so impress I have just bought the scrub and the eye cream
"This is an exceptional Retinol Serum. I love that it has a silky feel, no fragrance"
I have been using this for a year now. My skin is much smoother and hydrated.
I've been using this for about 7 weeks and don't notice much difference.
