"As you can read by my other Olay review, I began using this Serum along with the Micro Sculpting Cream and Pore Cleaner last year. When I ran out I thought I'd save a little money and use up something I had on hand. I could see a difference when I quit using them and purchased more of these products. I really like them and will continue to use them from now on."
"I have been using Olay products for years. Rrcently, I heard a dermatologist recommend serum as part of your daily routine. I ordered the Olay serum from Walmart. What a difference this product has made in my skin. My pores are smaller. I have a sheen and brightness I didn't have before. I no longer wear foundation everyday, only CC cream occasionally. I wish I knew about this product sooner. I definitely recommend this product."
"I liked it from the day i started using it, followed by creme moisturizer, been a month now. Skin feels so soft, fresh and oilfreee. I love using it."
Great for keeping the facial skin smooth
"This is my first experience with a serum, and all i have to say is, why didnt i use one earlier. Using this along with the micro-sculpting cream is making my skin improve. It cleared my acne, which is just a plus, i see my acne scars fading and just overall a healthier face."
I have used the fragrance free regenerist serum for years and loved the way it felt and how it made my skin look and feel but I am very disappointed in the new product. It doesn't feel soothing and makeup in hard to smooth over it. I also noticed a price increase and making the bottle larger doesn't make 1.7oz last any longer than before. I will continue to use it until I can find something better. Very sad to lose an old friend!
Sorry Olay this serum is not as good as the original Olay Regenerist Regenerating Serum!
"It dried my skin out, and did not leave a good finish for foundation application. I'm going back to the original!"
A must have for me!
Very rich and moist product. I feel younger already!
When you put on this serum it feels so very wonderful on your skin and glides on very smooth. No greasy feel at all!
"I love all of the Oil of Olay products I've tried (regenerating serum, moisturizer, facial cleansers). Been using them for over 35 years."
This product makes me feel younger than my aged. Very effective compare to other brands and very affordable. Amazing product a lot of choices and not so strong to the skin very useful to my everyday routine.
"This product works well, for my fine lines and can tell a difference. As I have allergic reactions to perfumes, this one has no fragrance and no chemical smell either. It feels wonderful and creamy but absorbs into your skin, without leaving you shiny. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum has tackled my worst skin problems and won. It has totally rid my eye area of fine wrinkles, and has significantly reduced the appearance of surgical scars to the point that others don't even seem to notice them. Used with Olay Micro-Sculpting Cream and with Regenerist Moistuizer, I wouldn't ever want to be without it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Have been using your micro-sculpting cream for several years in combination with the regenerating serum. My skin is less wrinkled and firmer. Just bought the lotion with SPF 30 and like that feature. An all-in-one product. An excellent value for a great moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Is very light and velvety, absorbs quickly, gives me enough moisture where I need it and doesn't make my oily spots oilier...Firms and smooth's my face and neck. Being that it's a light moisturizer and a serum in one it fits into my budget and I don't need a lot of other products...when I need more moisture in the winter I use coconut oil and the micro-Sculpting Serum works well with it. Love that it's fragrance free too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum Fragrance Free is a marvelous product for women of any age, particularly for women like me who are struggling with middle-aged wrinkling and lines that they are trying to heal and hide. It drastically improved my face's look and skin's overall successful, smooth appearance. I love it and am thankful for this special product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum Fragrance Free for few month and my skin is brighter and more firm, but the best feature that serum is fragrance free if you have allergies this would work best. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wear this twice a day, morning and nite under moisturizer. It is so light and non greasy. It also gives my skin a luminous glow. I have used other, more expensive serums, that did not have such a positive effect. Normally during sumner months I skip a serum and moisturizer, but this serum is light enough to use all summer. I would strongly recommended this serum to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using regenerist micro-sculpting serum for over 10 years. I use it after cleansing my face in the morning before I apply moisturizer. It smooths my skin and helps prevent fine lines from forming. It is a the perfect way to start my morning skin routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I always use this product every morning and every night before bed, after washing my face. My face never feels dry where I think I would need another product. I wonder about the new products for the face that are online constantly, especially from Dr. Oz. I would love to know how your product compares to that one. But I stick by OLAY, because I'm very satisfied. Cathy [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is my go-to. It goes under all my other Regenerist products. It's the first thing that I put on my fresh-washed face morning and night. Makes all the other products work better and glide on nicely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product. I am almost 80 years old and am often asked about my wonderful skin from my daughters-in-law and friends. I use this serum on a regular basis and consider it as important as soap and water for a shower. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this product everyday after cleansing my face. It feels like velvet on my face.It diminishes my fine lines. I use total effects 7 over it. I love all oil of Olay products! These two are my absolute favorites that I use everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been so pleased with the results I've received from this serum. After using this product my face has become brighter and much softer. I definitely see a difference in the appearance of the fine lines as well. I also love the fact that it absorbs so quickly and leaves my face so smooth. I would definitely recommend this product! Love my Olay serum!
"Thanks, thank you so much Olay for making a fragrance free version of this product. I am very sensitive to smells and it is so hard to find good skincare without feeling like I am putting perfume on my face. To top it off this product WORKS. I am seeing a difference and it's only been three weeks. If I could I would use it all over my body, I might still start doing that."
I really like this product smoothed lines and keeps my skin hydrated all day. . I can't use anything with fragrance so I'm glad Olay offers products without fragrance. I wish you'd offer the fragrance free micro firming cream in a pump bottle instead of a jar. I don't like using beauty products that come in jars. I believe to much Bactria gets into the product when Apply with fingers.
"I'm so glad Olay makes some fragrance free products! This serum is fantastic and it works so well for my drier skin:) I love Olay REGENERIST and used to only use Clinique. My skin actually looks better with Olay. I may be 60 but don't look it thanks to Olay! Yippee, I'm so happy spending less on such wonderful skincare that works!!!"
"I was really excited when this product came out because I MUST use Fragrance Free and this is the only Micro-Sculpting Product that does not contain aloe. Aloe seems to be the only ingredient my facial skin is sensitive to. I agree with the first reviewer, this product does not hydrate nearly as well as the Regenerist FF serum. I was not able to use it long enough to see firming results because it made my skin look drier as the weeks went by. Would love a Fragrance Free firming product that hydrates well and does not contain aloe!"
I love this play product! Its fragrance free and leaves your skin feeling amazing!
It works. It takes care of lines and dryness. It leaves your face feeling like velvet.
I picked this up on sale and have been hooked ever since. My complexion looks smoother and more hydrated after using it for about a month. For the price compared to other serums I have tried I don't think it can be beat. Highly reccomended! #contest
I have been a dedicated user of this serum for so many years and I am totally satisfied with the results shown in over the years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using Regenerist for 4 years now and love it as much now as I did when I first started using it. I am 61 years old and I am always told that I look between 40 & 50 :) great stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Never greasy and absorbs completely. Leaves my skin with a soft, healthy glow. Tight skin and small wrinkles are instantly smoothed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this serum for about a month. The other day I was in the store and someone said to me ""Wow! Your face is so beautiful! It just glows!"" What a great compliment!"
"Non oily, feels good on the skin, no perfume smell, light"
"I have used this product for several years. Results are as promised. The serum is quickly absorbed into your skin, looks and feels great."
Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting fragrance free serum is the best for sensitive skin like mine - it moisturizes and softens my dry skin.

I have now been using this for 3 months and I can tell a difference in my skin. I would recommend this to everyone.
"Makes skin fees so smooth, non-irritating, excellent for sensitive skin. I use it at night. A little goes a long way. Love the pump delivery system."
"It's wonderfull, l love it , leave skin very soft"
Just alone it's awesome under makeup.. and makes my skin feel so soft and smooth
This item is great---non-greasy and have made more purchases
My skin feel really smooth after using this. I combine it with Olay total effects.
"The serum is absorbed very fast. But I've been only using it for a couple of weeks, haven't felt a big difference yet."
Loved it
