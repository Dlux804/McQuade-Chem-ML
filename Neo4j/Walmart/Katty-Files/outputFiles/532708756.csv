This gel mist was very refreshing each time I used it. I love how refreshing it made my face look after a long day. I found myself wanting to use it more often when the temperature was warmer. It definitely helped to cool my face down as well as help me face to feel more hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this Neutrogena Hydro Boost City Sheild Gel Mist. Its so simple to use and its effective. Simply use it on a clean face spray it once or twice. It gives you a nice boost of refreshment. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I live in Miami Florida and weather here is very hot. I loved carrying the Neutrogena gel mist, it kept me cool and fresh. I have dry skin and it helped me feel hydrated all day with just a couple of sprays throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the perfect mist for a no make up day, the mist is refreshing. It's a bit sticky but it's not bothering at all. This is the best pick-me-up during my busy day. Keeps my skin glowy and hydrated. Just use your hands to massage the product on your face and it gives you the cooling affect while still getting the full benefits of this product.

"It's been one week that I've been using this product. My skin was dry in the T area and my nose oily. After using this product 2 times a day, my skin feels moisturized, no grease. The product smells good and I haven't had problems with any reaction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this product! It works get on my dry skin and it also smells get to compared to other products I have tried. And it's not heavy on my skin either. I highly recommend neutrogena hydro boost city shield gel mist! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Mist was too strong and left my skin feeling tacky. I did try it with no makeup, on top of, and under makeup and no matter how I tried it just was not something I enjoyed. After the ""mist"" initially settles there is a small period of time where you feel refreshed before it leaves a slightly sticky film on the skin. Of all the ways I tried it I will say it worked best for me under my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product! It is lightweight, refreshing and smells really good. It leaves my face feeling soft, more toned and quenched. This is especially helpful because I live in the Northeast where the winters leave my skin feeling dry. All you need is two sprays so the bottle should last awhile. I know once I run out I'll buy another one! Highly recommended!"
"I have never used a mist before, but I tried this out since my skin gets pretty dry during the winters. Definitely feels moisturizing, but I only use it on the weekends when I'm not in a rush. I feel like it takes too long to fully absorb/dry when I'm rushing on weekday mornings before work. Also seems like a higher price point than what I would expect for a Neutrogena product."
The new Neutrogena Hydro boost shield gel mist honestly seems like a waste of money. I think you would get the same effect just spraying your face with water. My skin didn't feel any more hydrated then normal except right after I used the product and my face was still wet. I also think its weird spray something on my face and it felt uncomfortable. The only time I think I might use this would be a hot summer day when I outside and I want to cool off a little. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I liked this product. It made my skin feel so soft and refreshed.
It works well and has none of the unpleasant sensation or odor in some hydration products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I thought I would like it but when I put it it felt sticky in my face and oily at the same time and didn't like the way it sprays it's like they are trowing water in the face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The packaging looked appeasing and the color of the solution was very appealing. When spritzing on it covers the whole face on one spritz. Feels a bit sticking at first but drys very fast.

I like how this product smells and feels on my face. It definitely is moisturizing. My face feels soft as well. My only problem is I probably won't use this product too often because my face is not that dry. I also do not wear makeup either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Have never used a product like this before. I almways need to moisturize my face after a shower and usually used lotion which would leave my skin almost feeling greasy.

And guess what, when I got home from work, I noticed a glow on my face when I checked it despite having a long day. I like it. I recommend this product and might buy some more.

I did like it. But there was nothing special. My rose water spray does the same thing. I have only been using it a week but I will continue to use it. Hopefully I see something different my rose water doesnt do for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The Neutrogena Hydro Boost City Shield Gel Mist is incredible! It literally makes my skin feel super hydrated and very soft.

Bought this at ulta with the gel cream with spf. This spray has alcohol as it's third ingredient. Not only that my face will NOT stop itching since I began using it. I will have to go see dermatologist if this doesn't resolve. I really wanted to love this product but so far hate it and it's not like it was cheap either.
"The product comes in a nice pacakaging, it can be worn alone or under makeup. I haven't tried it under makeup yet but when I used it alone it was nice. My skin felt hydrated. Love it. Will definitely try it under makeup too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"It's certainly refreshing, and moisturizing. I tried it under and over my makeup and love it! Under makeup I light rub it in. If I'm using it as a mid day moisture boost, I spray it and then lightly dab/tap it into my skin. Really does help my skin stay moisturized and plump looking. Also make my skin look more glowy (I know that isn't a word) naturally. Something I'll definitely use daily! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While the feel of my skin after using Neutrogena Hydro Boost City Shield Gel is better and feels moisturized, I really, REALLY dislike the application of the product. I think it could be applied better by hand rather than spraying onto your face. If following directions, one or two spritzs doesn't really give you FULL coverage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

The stuff is really nice for refreshing your skin when it feels a little dry or you just need a little dewy glow to your face after applying makeup.

Thanks for the free sample. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far I really love this product. I live in Minnesota and the winter months are very tough on my skin leaving it dry. This goes on nice and thick and dries really quickly.

I will definitely be buying this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

It feels really refreshing and moisturizing on the skin. The sprayer gives a nice light even wide spray. I love that it has spf! It makes a great setting spray and an even better refreshing spray. My skin can be beautifully moisturized in the morning but will turn dry and make my makeup look patchy by noon. The spray brought it right back to a beautiful smooth application [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a really good product. It does keep my skin refreshed and hydrated but that's without makeup. It's a little sticky and I wouldn't wear it over my makeup,but other than that it keeps skin feeling refreshed and hydrated. Would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I always find myself needing more hydration during the day so I was excited to try this mist. The scent is pleasant and the formula itself is light. It absorbs nicely into the skin without needing to be rubbed in. The one issue that I did have is that the mist is a bit heavy so you need to hold the bottle back far, a finer spray would have been nicer. Overall it is hydrating, easy to use and didn't mess up my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Based on the title I was worried about trying this product. I thought it was going to be a thicker spray but in fact it was light and airy.

I lpve this product so easy to use and sprays a mist that is so light you cant even tell that its on i used it before applying my makeup but you can apply after also.

I love this product and will continue to purchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This facial mist is refreshing, lightly fragrant, leaving a very fresh feeling on the skin. Winter in a cold climate can make it very difficult to keep skin hydrated, and this mist feels like a nice, even mist refresher on my face. Most often, I use it before make-up is applied, but it is versatile and can be used before make-up application or after. It is a nice treat for the skin, I would recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was a fantastic product. This product was very light and airy. I do not wear makeup so I did not cover it with anything and it was still very light.

Tye mist Helped revive and improve the look of my pollution-stressed skin. Read up on this product yet there were times it was sticky and the product made my skin look amazing.

"This product worked really well. I used it throughout the day to freshen my makeup up. It kept me looking dewy, not oily. I also liked the fact that it dried super fast.

"It felt great when I sprayed it on my face, but I found no lasting effects. I didn't feel the product even just 5 minutes later. I think it would be great during a hot day, or after a big workout, but it isn't a product that I found to be beneficial to my face/skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
For someone who has struggled with keeping their skin hydrated for most of their life this Hydro Boost line is a life saver. I love this spray since it can be applied on or under makeup throughout the day for day-long hydration. Also this smells great! Just spritz twice over your face for all day hydration! Best paired with Neutrogena Hydro Boost moisturizers and cleansers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Neutrogena Hydro Boost City Shield Gel Mist seemed like it would fit my lifestyle very well. I was hoping to have a quick and easy spray of mist to hydrate and refresh my face over the course of the day. Unfortunately, the scent is too strong, and lingers through the morning; and the spray leaves my face (especially my lips) feeling sticky, rather than refreshed. This occurs whether I have previously applied makeup or not. Not the right product for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Neutrogena ® Hydro Boost City Shield Gel Mist is a must have for your skin! This mist has a great scent and is so light weight, not what you would think a gel spray would be. It absorbs quickly and hydrates within seconds. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had high hopes for the facial mist, but I don't feel like it moisturizers my face that well. I feel like I need more than 1 to 2 sprays as it suggests. If I do one spray, it doesn't feel like it coats my face well. There's also a tingling feeling that I don't really care for with this product. I will continue to use it to see how it performs over the next few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
