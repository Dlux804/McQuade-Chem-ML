I saw visable difference in a few days. Afyer i used a bottle i went back to my old stand by. It only took a few days to teturn to Equate.
"Just started using this moisturizer, but really like it so far. Easy to apply and my skin feels soft and smooth."
It is not only just as good as the more expensive brand but it smells better too.
LOVE IT! Does reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles around the mouth and on the forehead. I look like I'm in my early 30's and I'm mid 40's. No one EVER guesses my age right. Product doesn't have a whole lot of moisturizing properties so sometimes my cheeks are dry but I use something else on my cheeks when that happens. Excellent product!
Half the price of the name brand butbeorks as well!
"Being 86 years old taking care of my skin is most important. Being on Social Security limits me to what I can afford. Being a fan of other equate products I tried ""Wrinkle Repair"" which i purchased at Wal Mart in Joliet IL. Imagine my disappointment to find the bottle empty. And the plunger stem bent. I tried to empty the bottle manually but found there was nothing in the bottle. Will reconsider other products at my next purchase."
I was septical trying this but i wanted to try its a little less expensive than nutrogena . I have been happy woth this purchase .i do use the nighttime nutrogwna wrinkle serum as well .i saw a nice change in my skin scars from past acne and just discoloration overall .
I've been very satisfied by the Wal-Mart Equate brand for many different products. I was excited to see an Equate product for the rapid wrinkle repair. The price is great! I can only use this under my eyes. I am happy with the results but because I am prone to blemishes I can't use it as an all over moisturizer. It gave me pimples the next day.
"I have no ideas if it works because I had to wash it off. The strong rose perfume was too much for me. I know many people like that scent but I never have, and after 15 minutes it had not faded at all."
The product does not work for me; maybe because I am 76 years old and the wrinkles have set in ... forever....
This product has all the same ingredients as Neutrogena and Olay for half the cost. No need to pay higher prices. It really feels nice on my face.
Soaks in fast without leaving skin oily. The sunscreen factor alone is worth it. I believe this lotion definitely equals the higher-priced name brand.
"Makes my skin smooth and soft, but strong perfume scent makes me want to stop using it?"
"It is a very good sun screen plus moisturizer, some sun screens tend to make my eyes burn,this does not plus, it is half the price of my old sun screen,make up goes on well over it."
price and it is just like the brand name that is $9 more I have been using it since it has been available
