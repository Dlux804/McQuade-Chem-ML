This is the only cream that gives me the deep penetrating hydration my skin needs. My forehead was peeling from the dryness caused by winter weather. Regular nightly use finally has it beginning to heal.
used this since they started making it. every time I try something else my skin notices. I can only use Olay without getting dry spots or red spots.. I just stay with Olay and its a lot cheaper than fancy stores [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this! It makes my skin the softest it's ever been.A lovely ,silk like texture and smoothing effect. I don't know how it works but I get results and that's all I care about other than the fact that it's fragrance free. Thanks Olay :)"
"Feels so nice, soft light fragrance and stays on all night. My face is very hydrated in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this amazing night cream is excellent for all skin types, you awaken with a vibrant glow, and more refind , smooth , youthful looking skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using Olay products for too many years to count. This product is perfect for night time use and keeps my aging skin looking young. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using olay since I was in my 30's, I am 63 and have very few wrinkles. People are shocked at my age! I feel it's due to no sun, no smoking and olay everyday! I am a believer in this product."
Must use nightly to keep aging skin at it's best!
"I use this faithfully every night! Its not greasy or sticky and smoothes over your face very nicely. When I wake in the morning my skin doesn't feel dry or like I slept with grease on my face all night like some overnight moisturizers do. Great product! I am a diehard Olay consumer! I get great results from every product I've tried. My only wish is that Olay would give more instructed regimens, like what product to use when and which one goes over top of another. That would be VERY helpful on this website!!!!!"
"I use the Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment with Olay Regenerist Daily Serum every night and I have seen a real improvement in my skin's texture and appearance. My friends have even complimented me on how good my skin looks and ask me what I have been using. It took several weeks of consistent use, but these two products have really made a difference for me."
"I have used this Night Cream for about 1 year and never miss a night of applying. When I started, I had crow's feet around the eyes and puffy eyes till noontime every day. Now , my skin is very supple, no crow's feet showing and my eyes are not puffy most days when I wake up. I will continue indefinitely buying this cream. I also use the Olay regenerist day cream and will continue."
I am 58 years old and I have been using Oil of Olay products for years. I do not look my age and I do contribute Oil of Olay for helping my skin look younger. I just started using this product and I love it and will continue to use it as long as possible. I have tried manye expensive products and always gone back to Olay. Keep up the good work.
"I've been addicted to Regenerist Night Recover for a couple of years. My neck is starting to show my age and this cream smooths the skin, making the crepiness almost disappear. I use it both morning and night. It's my stranded-on-a-desert-island pick, along with sunscreen. :-)"
"I WAS A MAKEUP ARTIST, LONG AGO. I HAVE USED MENY PRODUCTS IN MY LIFE. I WAS A FLIGHT ATTENDANT FOR 34 YR. YOU KNOW HOW DRYING THE ALTITUDE CAN BE ON YOUR SKIN. ESPECIALY ON INTERNATIONAL FLIGHTS. REGENERIST NIGHT MOISTURIZING IS THE BEST PRODUCT I HAVE EVER USED!!!! I TELL ALL MY FRIENDS ABOUT IT. IT MAKES MY SKIN FEEL SO SOFT AND CLEAN. I ALSO LIKE THE SMELL OF YOUR PRODUCT."
"This is the best night cream ever! It smells wonderful!! I saw a huge improvement when I used this. I swear by it. I will never use anything else. I used to pay 2x the price of this for other facial creams and due to a tough economy I have had to cut back. I wish I had know how great this was years ago! My skin has less wrinkles and my rosacea has calmed down so much that I feel comfortable not wearing make up...on the weekend, during the day."
"I've been using this cream for a couple months now. Its light, non greasy, no perfumes. Kind of luxurious. Very hydrating. I recommend."
I bought this few weeks ago and I really like it. It provides immediate improvements in terms of soft and relaxed skin.
Love this cream. I have used others by Olay Regenerist and this is the best by far. I will definitely purchase this again.
"This was not at all what I ordered, it was whipped and it sounds like it is sunblock lotion. I don't even see how you could mix up the lavender color night cream with the dark red whipped container. Very disappointed"
I have used several of the Olay products but this is my favorite. It glides on like silk and smells fabulous. My skin feels smoother and less dry since using the Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizer.
"This used to be my favorite until they repackaged it and raised the price by nearly $10. they also must have changed the formula as it now is not easily absorbed and doesn't firm near as good. I will no longer be buying this item. Also, not shipped in 2 days as per walmart.com free shipping policy."
Still waiting for the wonderful moisture to my skin.
"Good price, fast shipping!"
"Finished my old jar of night cream, bought new jar, opened it up to find a totally different cream. Not the lavender, sweet smelling, somewhat thick formula I had loved (and in my opinion worked miracles!) This new cream is white, sort of thin and did not work the same at all...Returned very next day and bought the night of olay. So disappointed....."
"I've been using the night recovery cream for a little over 3 weeks and I dont know how I went so long without! It leaves my otherwise oily skin, soft and smooth each morning. It's worked wonders on my acne prone skin. I now use this religiously along with the eye serum, microderm/peel system 2xweek, serum 2x week (after each peel), and the Olay Protective Renewal Lotion with BHC and SPF (daily). All together, this skin regimen has cleared and softened my skin. Thank you Olay!"
"This is the best moisturizer I have ever tried. I use this day and night. It leaves my skin silky soft and never greasy or heavy feeling. I also apply this to my hands and elbows when they are dry, works wonders. Best all purpose cream I have ever used. I would recommend this to all age groups."
"I have been using Oil of Olay since I was 24yrs. old. Everyone tells me what beautiful facial skin I have. No one belives I am my age, I get guessed 10 - 20 yrs. younger than I am. I have been using Oil of Olay Regenerist since it came out on the market, I love Oil of Olay and will continue to use it for the rest of my life. Thank you oil of Olay!"
"this is the best night cream I've ever used. I've been using it now for many years and love it. I've tried other brands of night creams, but this one makes your face feel, young, refreshed and lifted each day. It's a must for all women. A pick-me-up in a jar. It goes on smooth and easy and if there is one product you must have and use every night, make it this one."
It is rejuvenating to your skin and neck. Plus well worth the effort to keep your face young and plump.
I have trouble with skin allergies. Love the fragrance free aspect of this product. I have very dry skin and like the texture and moisturizer.
"Great moisturizer that is well priced, non greasy and makes my skin feel great in the morning."
I've been using olay for years and never been let down
"I've tried so many skin creams and lotion, this is the only one that deeply moisturizers and doesn't cause acne. I highly recommend this product."
LOVE THIS! After the 1st use i could feel the difference. i use it every other night...worth every penny!
I love this product and I've used it for years. I love the way it plumps up your skin and gives you a smooth feel and overall younger-looking skin
So nice to feel on my face. Will not change product.i Fall in Love with this cream.
Great moisturizer; leaves my skin feeling soft and supple.
I have always loved this product It is better than the department store brands.
"I have tried many different expensive night time face treatments. Regenerist night cream out performs them all. It really is the best, when I wake up my skin looks great. I am so please with this product."
"I had been using the original formula for many years. It used to leave a very nice soft, velvety feeling on your skin and felt really moisturized. The new white cream is very irritating to my skin, does not feel moisturized and the perfume is very strong."
"I am so disappointed that you have changed the formula for the Night Recovery Cream. This has been my FAVORITE product for many years with a silky feeling on my face with the delicious scent of the lavender cream. Now it is a sticky white thick mess. Please, please return the old product to our store shelves! Like another writer, I also get compliments on my skin and I recommend this cream to many people. No more."
"I have used this product for many years and was very happy with it. I was very disappointed when I bought my last jar and it seemed like a totally different product. New color, texture, smell. It is heavy and sits on my face. In the morning I can rub it off my face. I don't like the smell of the new product either. Why did you change a great product?!"
"I have used this product for years and was extremely happy with the results from using it, even receiving compliments on my skin from strangers, which should have told me something I was doing was right. But I was lured away from my favorite by a fancy sales hype, and switched formulas. Boy was I disappointed! Now I'm back to the night cream and I have my ""good"" skin back. I'll never stray again! Great product! Keep making it!!"
"I had been looking for a night cream that would moisturise my very dry, aging and sensitive skin. This has proven to be a wonderful product, my skin feels silky in the mornings and I do not see all the 'dry' lines on my face. The only reason I gave this 4 and not 5 stars is that I find the fragrance to be a bit over powering and would love to see this introduced either as less fragrant or fragrance free."
"I started using Regenerist about 5 weeks ago, and from the 1st time I used it I loved it. The texture, smell and they way it makes my skin feel both at night and when I wake up in the morning, is great. My skin is oily, with large pores and prone to acne breakouts. I've noticed in the past couple of days that my pores are so much smaller. My skin is so smooth and soft. I will continue to use the product and recommend it to anyone who asks."
"This night cream is okay, not great. It's not greasy nor is it tacky(sticky), and it's certainly not oily. However, I find it to leave my manly facial skin a bit on dry side. It's not hydrating as one might think or as Olay claims it it be and it cost too much. I stop using it."
Finally a product that does exactly what I wanted it to!! I had some fine lines on my forehead and they are gone after using this product! I have tried everything from La Mer to expensive dept. store moisturizers and they didn't work. This really works! The ads do not lie! Thank you thank you Olay! Never phase out this product from your line.
This is the best product I have ever used. I wake up and my skin is so clear and glowing that makeup is not needed. I am 38 and often mistaken for in my twenties. I work in the medical field and have access to high end skin care but choose olay instead.
"This is by far the best night cream I have ever used. I too, due to the tough economy, have had to cut back, and decided to give this product a try. I could not be more pleasantly surprised! I should have known though; my mother was an Olay woman, and always had beautiful skin - thanks Olay, for such a great product, at an affordable price!"
"I've used your Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment a short while ago. (I ran out and need MORE, ) But while I used it, my face?, my skin?, felt great! BOTH, at night while putting it ON. THEN waking up to nice, refreshed, smooth, HAPPY skin!! Your products really DO what they SAY they'll do! Thanks!! Sincerely, Kittykat1961 =^..^="
I have used a lot of night creams in my adult life. This cream is absolutely the best one I have ever used . I put it on at night and can feel the difference as I am applying . In the morning I wake up with my skin feeling as though I had just applied it. It is terrific!! Unique and does work!
"I am on my second jar of Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturing Treatment, as endorsed by InStyle magazine as the preferred night cream. I can see a difference in my skin texture whenever I forget to apply it before bedtime, and I can't imagine switching to any other product when I am crazy about this one!"
"I hate to admit it but I am getting older, but this product makes it easier to accept. I love the look of my face when I get up in the morning. I don't know about the mini face lift, but I do know my face does look rejuvenated and youthful each morning. Two-thumbs up for it."
This night treatment is so moisturizing! I am a product junkie - I try all kinds of skincare products - but this is the one nighttime moisturizer that really makes my skin feel GREAT the entire next day! An esthetician told me during a facial recently that my skin was dehydrated... her $40 cream didn't help. I tried Regenerist Night Recovery Moisturizing Treatment and voila! My skin feels and looks amazing!!
Moisturizes well and skin feels very smooth in the morning.
I have been using very expensive night cream. Decided to give this a try. Love it!
Love that this is fragrance free for night time use.
"I love how my face feels after I apply this moisturizer at night, and even the next day my face feels very hydrated. I can totally tell the difference when I use it!"
"I didn't think a cream could get much better than the Regenerist Daily Serum, but this night cream is fantastic. Really soaks right into the skin and has a non greasy, refreshing feel to it. Love this."
"I use this night cream,just for 2 weeks now ,but i saw really amazing improvement! i feel glow and firming my skin ,specialy around the eyes! i feel so good!thanx!olay!"
"I like this product, moisturizes my skin and my skin feels a lot smoother and fresher when i wake up. Then i use the regenerating serum during the day. Works well together for me."
"I loved this night cream and used it religiously for year. I told all my friends about it. Suddenly I could only find the fragrance free. Not only is the wonderful scent gone, the cream is now tacky like glue, not creamy and moisturizing like it has been. I'm so, so sad!"
"I just bought this night cream primarily because it is fragrance free. I CANNOT use anything with fragrance. I am thrilled with it so far. Not sticky or greasy. Great feel, absorbs instantly and my skin feels so soft. I've tried over 30 products with no success because I can't use them long enough to see if the results last. I am hoping I can continue to use this. So far so good but it's only been a few days. But getting this far is a miracle!"
"I have an extreme sinus allergy to scented products. There are so few fragrance-free products that I definitely knew I needed to try this. It's only been a few days but so far so good! I need more time to determine if it fulfills it's promises before I give it all 5 stars. I will be trying one of your daytime moisturizers, too. Do you have one to suggest? I am in the sun a lot."
"I don't care so much about fragrance (though it was lovely), however, the product IS different. It feels greasy and sticky now and my face feels suffocated. It feels as though it is sitting on top of my skin instead of soaking in. I see the responses to similar reviews, suggesting no change was made to the formula, but clearly your long-time customers know better. Since Olay doesn't want to address the issue in any real way, it's time to find something else that actually works."
It is a must I use fragrance free due to skin sensitivity. I just purchased today. Wasn't sure what to expect...Put it on before bed. My face FEELS AMAZING! The product is very silky and smooth. I'm not sure what people are talking about when they say “it's sticky feeling”.only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it's only first day using.
"I'm echoing the reviews of those of you who loved the lavender smell and the smoother, lighter feel of that product. I've written to Olay twice now in the last year hoping that with all of the obvious dissatisfaction with the new product, they would offer the superior lavender scented product once more. I've been hoarding jars of the original formula and am now down to my last one. I also am searching for a alternative. Olay - please listen!!"
"This is my first use of an olayfacial product and I don't find it sticky, or heavy, etc. It,s rather pleasant. My skin feels better...gotta wait a wee bit longer for disappearing wrinkles. I never used their other product so I can't compare. My guess is, the old product isn't coming back."
I have been using the night recovery and the eye lifting serum for 10+ years. Preferred it over high end products but since changing the formula (and the price point) I am now looking for something else. Please bring back the old formulations of these two products. I'll even pay the steeper price point if the old formula was used. :'(
"I can only use fragrance free products, so thanks Olay for offering this cream. I usually use the Micro Sculpting FF cream, but decided to give this a try because it was on sale. I actually like it better than the Micro Sculpting FF cream. It glides on and I saw a difference in just one use. I'd recommend this and will buy it again."
"I previously used the regenerist night cream. Lovely, silky, absorbed quickly, didn't irritate my skin, pleasant fragrance and made a noticeable difference. The new formula texture is sticky to fingers, doesn't apply well and feels sticky even after rubbing in and leaving for ten minutes. I will be returning this disappointing product. Olay, you had a lovely product. I wish you'd bring it back."
"Please bring back the old formula! I really loved this product. As soon as I ran out, I went to pick some more up but it was a newer version and it honestly did not feel the same it was heavier on the skin and did not have the silky feeling the old product did. They have lost my business for now hopefully they will bring back the old formula."
"I recently went back to using Olay Regenerist products and used to love the night recovery cream. I know they claim they didn't change the formula but this stuff is nothing like the old cream. I have to use a lot more of it and it does not feel like it really absorbs into my skin at all. I will not buy this again unless they change it back. Also the old smell was great, bring it back please."
"This blue jar with black lid night cream is wonderful. Here's the problem. I did mot receive this night cream. I received the new version with the silver lid, which is the new version of the old cream. For 25% of women it causes breakouts. Misery, I loved the old cream as did many others. I like Walmart delivery and the app is great. They should update the only me image for this product. Yes, I'm returning the merchandise. The process is easy so thanks for this part Walmart."
"Works just fine. At first I did not read that it shouldn't be anywhere near the eyes, so the first two nights of application I suffered. It has a smooth, slick kind of feeling to touch but I do not notice anything happening to my fine lines on my forehead. I have oily, sensitive skin so the fragrance free is great for me."
"why would olay take the fragrance out of the product? I miss the soothing scent. i've bought the new fragrance-free version, but i really miss the old formula. I'm getting old - aren't we all - but my skin feels drier than with the old formula. I'm supplementing with hyaluronic acid. I'd be less critical if I had that scent to fall to sleep to."
"I've been using this product for over twenty years and whenever I try something else I always come back to it. My fair sensitive skin responds so well to this night cream - nourished, uplifted, and like a mini facial. Really love this product. During the winter I use it during the day sometimes to get extra moisture and benefits."
"Loyal Olay user for decades and had to buy your new night cream. Several issues: it doesn't go on as smoothly and it no longer has that light wonderful scent, it now costs almost 3x more than the previous product this replaced, AND I noticed facial dryness in the morning and there is no more of the smooth soft skin I was accustomed to having after a week of using this new product...I'm also noticing my wrinkles, pores, and uneven skin tone more, ughhhh so disappointed!"
"I had used the original formula for years and LOVED it. It was soft and silky, non sticky, hydrating. It smelled awesome to boot! This new formula is absolutely awful and none of the above! I couldn't even finish the jar. I no longer buy this product. Really wish they would bring back the original. I've seen the Olay responses to all these negative comments and very disappointed."
"This new stuff is thick, greasy and unpleasant, unlike the original purple product. You can copy and paste the same response to all these dis-satisfied customers, but it doesn't change the fact that you ruined a great product. I'm sure this is reflected in your sales numbers. The product feels totally different and for every one dis-satisfied customer who took the time to post a response, there are probably a thousand who didn't, who feel the same way. BRING BACK THE OLAY WE KNOW AND LOVE!"
"I like the old product better, when it was lavender color and had a light scent. However, this seems to work almost as well. I am 61 years old and am just now getting little lines around my eyes. Even my dermatologist said my skin looks amazing and asked what I used. I will be a lifelong user of this night cream. I have tried lots of other creams and moisturizers but nothing works as well as this one. Thanks Olay."
"I completely agree, the original product was so good! I loved this product and had used it for a long time. But whatever changes they have made, have not Been for the better. I've been using a different product and will continue until they change it back"
"I have very dry & sensitive skin. I've been using this cream for 3 weeks. I love it. I apply it b4 bed & in the morning. The dry patches on my face have gone away. My skin is softer now. My powder & concelour glide onto my face when before it would look flaky. I have found this products works great for me in the day time as well. I apply it 1st then follow up with Olay Complete sensitive skin w SPF. Does Olay have a day cream that is just as good as this night cream? If so, please do recommend."
"I don't like the new product. Bring back the original. This new product feels thick and doesn't have the same consistency. It also does not work nearly as well as the previous product. Never understand why a company would take an outstanding product out of production and throw something on the shelves thinking people will continue to buy it just because it has the same name. Very disappointed in Olay. Please, bring back the previous product! I won't be buying this one for sure."

Please bring back the frangrance! It was a 5 star product before. It was such a subtle scent and I loved how it smelled and made me look forward to a good night's sleep. I've looked everywhere for the scented product and finally had to buy the fragrance-free version. It is not the same and doesn't feel as silky on my skin. You had a winner of a product before the change. Now I have to find another night time product as I don't like this one as much.
"This product is amazing because it does what it promises. After using this product I wake up with my skin feeling moisturized and hydrated. I am definitely ""hooked"" I am using the ""fragrance free"" night cream which I totally appreciate. Oil of Olay does it again!!! Thanks ""Oil of Olay""."
I MISS THE FRAGRANCE!!!!!!!!!!!! You keep saying all you did was remove the fragrance but in doing so it changed the silkiness of the product. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE bring back the old product. Total Effects is NOT the same. Why do companies insist on ruining a good thing......seems to me you were selling the product or you wouldnt have so many unhappy customers writing reviews.
I liked the old version of this product - it was the perfect night cream. It was absorbed into your skin without leaving a greasy feeling. You woke up to great skin feeling fresh. Please add the old product back to the other wonderful line of Olay products. Thank you.
"I loved this product for many years! I have rather oily skin, so the silky, non-greasy touch of this product used to be just perfect. It moistured the skin without evoking greasy skin. This new formula feels like pure grease on the skin and does not apply as well as the old formula. I am forced to move on from Olay."
"I used this product after using the Olay Pro-X Microdermabrasion + Advanced Cleansing System, 4 pc I purchased at the same time. Thought the cleansing system made May face smooth and clean feeling; this was the cherry on the sundae! I can feel the difference in the texture and my skin looks quenched and feels amazing. Today was the first time my face didn't ""feel"" or looked exhausted. It had a softness look about it. It did not look or feel oily, but healthy! I would recommend trying this overnight cream."
"I've used this products for years now..I love it...when people hear that I am 59 they say...no way...or that it's hard to believe..they usually guess I'm in my 40's...sure genetics has something to do with it, but so does using the oil of Olay eye and regenerist products does too....I love the way it feels on my cleansed skin at night...luxurious feel!!"
I have been using this product for years. The new formula is much less creamy and has a very unpleasant smell. I always buy fragrance-free but the new formula definitely does not smell good. And the texture and feel is sticky. I normally would rub my fingers over my hands when I am done applying it to my face. Now I am washing my hands. My skin feels dry and tight. Sorry Olay - think it is time to switch brands after so many wonderful years of being happy with your product.
"Satin-y feel, not greasy. Went on smoothly and had no fragrance or smell. It did not make me break out or clog my pores. I live in the desert where hydration is a must, and thought this was just as good as the pricier ones. For my skin though, I still prefer the regular Frangrance-free Regenerist micro-sculpting cream at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay always offer a good product, I never had any issues and is my go-to drugstore brand. I used the Regenerist night recovery cream. No discernable smell, not heavy, went on velvety smooth, very natural feeling on my skin, as if I had nothing on. I also used a slightly more expensive night cream on alternating nights and didn't really noticed much of a difference with the Regenerist night recovery cream. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This Olay product did not disappoint. It felt velvety and very smooth on my skin and I look forward to putting it on every night after washing my face. It provided the exact right amount of moisture. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love olay regenerist creams. Unfortunately, I can never find the night time cream. My question is can you use the daytime at night? Couldn't get an answer. Best product I've found. Doesn't make my skin break out. My wrinkles disappeared. Dang coupon expired. I ended up buying the daytime. I'm going to try at night."
This product does what is says it will and more. My skin looks and feels healthier and younger. I am amazed at the difference and improvement. It only took two days before I began to see results from this product. Thank you Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I needed a night Cream to supplement my day time Olay seven layer moisturizer. The Night Recovery cream has a nice light scent and was non greasy. It went on so easily and seem to just melt into my skin. Some wrinkle creams leave my skin itchy as they work. But this cream had no side effects and it make a big improvement with the first week. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product sounds like perfection. Love peptides and moisture! Good for sensitive skin because it is fragrance free. I have sensitive, dry skin and this goes on so smoothly and feels amazing at night. Have not used it long enough to notice any skin improvement. Did wake up with drier than normal skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love almost every Olay product I've tried, but I think this one is my favorite! This night cream is velvety, not oily, which is perfect for my skin. And it's fragrance-free! I've only been using it for a few weeks and I love the results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the feel of my skin while using this product! It is so much softer and I notice less fine lines and my wrinkles seem smaller! I'm still using it so the jar goes a long way too! My skin feels very hydrated and that's important during the winter especially. It never feels greasy either. I really recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Was pleasantly surprised at the size of the 'sample' jar - regular size!
"Feels good going on. I was already using an Olay Regenerist Night cream, but I can tell a small difference in my neck area (I have only been using this for a little over a week.) Just sorry that the MSRP shown on the web site is so high; it may prevent me from buying in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Thank you so much for the sample. I love the silky feel of the product and, even though I usually have trouble with dry spots in the winter time, I have not had one dry spot since I started using the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is great for combination skin. It doesn't feel heavy. Very minute smell to the product. There wasn't any irritation around my eyes or other sensitive skin on my fact. I would highly recommend this product. I just wish the price was less. Good buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am 69 years old and have used Olay products since I was a teenager. I constantly am told by friends and strangers alike that I have beautiful skin. The consistency of this product is wonderful. It goes on so smoothly and does not leave a greasy feeling. I also like the fact that there is no overpowering fragrance. I would not hesitate to buy this product again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product! I'm so glad glad I got this as a free gift. This night cream is amazing. It goes on so smooth, and because it's so creamy you don't need to use that much. I love putting it on after washing my face before I go to bed..I actually look forward to using it! I highly recommend this. I'm 59 years old and I feel my face already looks better after two weeks of using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"From the moment I put this moisturizer on my skin, my face felt so smooth and hydrated. I love the feel of this moisturizer. My skin doesn't feel greasy either. I would recommend this product to anyone and everyone. I know I will continue using this product each night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product, like all Olay creams, feels good to the skin. NOT greasy, which is a plus. I prefer the natural smell, not perfumed. Only complaint is the cost. Would like to see all Olay products at lesser costs. However, Olay has been my product since 1970, so will not change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Olay products in the past (especially regenerist) and have been impressed. It had been a while since I have used Olay and was pleased to try a new product but, while I like everything about the feel and smell of the product I haven't noticed any change in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I don't usually use night cream but when I received this, I decided to try it. I love the feeling on my skin. Not greasy! Soft. And I love the feel when I woke up. My skin was softer and smoother. I will continue to use this wonderful product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am so very disappointed with the new formula. I was a dedicated user & promoter of the old purple cream...it was light, smelled lovely & left my face feeling very soft & hydrated. The ""new & improved"" version is a bust. It is thick, does not spread on nicely & has an unfavorable scent. I am currently searching for another night cream. From a 26 year user of Olay products."
"I have used this for years and it was the only product I would buy. The new formulation is horrible. It's heavy, greasy and does nothing for my skin. I was so unhappy with it I threw out 2/3 of a jar. I have gone with another brand and will no longer purchase this item in the future unless it returns to the old formulation. You have ruined a good product and have lost a once loyal customer."
"Originally I used the older formula;the purple cream with a subtle,light scent.Smell was soothing & in the morning my face felt smooth & seemed to glow.Recently decided to try it again.Very disappointed & returning it.New one is a white cream that doesn't feel as soft as the older one & does not provide the same results.'Light fragrance' it claims to have is way too strong,much stronger than older one."
"What has happened to this product? Recently purchased and am surprised that this inferior product would be sold in the same packaging as the original. Definitely not the same... Greasy feel, sticky for hours, texture all wrong. Frustrated that I am going to have to go through the trouble again of trying numerous other products, as I will never buy this again."
"Being a Realtor can be stressful. And embarking on a new career at 40? It's dances all over your face. A tight budget and a fond childhood memory of Oil of Olay; I decided to give the new line a try. So happy I did, I LOVE Regenerist! 5 stars hands down. Creamy, hydrating, drys like a serum, and morning results are fabulously staring back at you in the mirror. Even after a late eve at the local martini bar. I'm a fan;-)"
"I have been using the Regenerist Night Recovery Cream for about12 years, and I love how it glides on and soaks right in, leaving my skin silky feeling for bed. I've been told by many that I don't look my age, so this is probably why! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am 43 years old and have had acne my entire life! My nurse practitioner (who also uses Olay) recommended that I stop using everything except Olay products. I use the regenerist cleanser, serum and night recovery. The night recovery leaves my skin smooth, has helped my wrinkles and my face is clear for the first time ever! Thank you so much!"
"Began using product less than 3 days ago and already can see/feel the difference in my skin. Softer, smoother, ""younger"" looking. Fragrance isn't overwhelming as I usually buy fragrance free products/sensitive skin products. Definitely will continue using :-) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love my Regenerist Night Recovery Cream. From the very first time I used it, I awoke with baby soft skin. Now that I'm near the bottom of the jar, I can definitely see an improvement in my fine lines, particularly under my eyes. I will be buying this again soon!

This product along with so many more of the Oil of Olay collection is fantastic. I have been using Olay for 20+ years and I will never stop. I love you guys. 41 looking like 31; Thank you Oil of Olay family! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for years. It smells wonderful. A small amount covers my entire face and neck. It feels like liquid silk going onto my face. On occasion, i've tried other creams, then regret not sticking with my normal routine. It has minimized my fine lines and helps me look 10 years younger. Which is a big deal since i live in hot, sunny Florida. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been a fan of Olay ever since my first pink bottle of Oil of Olay. Now that my skin is more mature, I use Olay Regenerist Night Recovery Cream. I love the way it makes my skin feel when I put it on and I love the way my face feels when I wake up in the morning.With products like the Regenerist line, I will continue to be a fan for life.

I tried the Regenerist Night Recovery Cream last week and fell in love with it! After just three days of using it I could tell a difference in my face. It looked more youthful and had less wrinkles. I also love the way it smells! It is a little pricey but well worth it for the results it gave me. I highly recommend this cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Tried night recovery cream after so many other products in my long life. when I first tried the Night Recovery Cream the very first time, I noticed how when applied it went on smooth and made my face feel soft and young again. So many others were like putting lard and would not see an effect. This is my forever Night cream and would certainly recommend to anyone to give it a try, you won't be sorry.

"I had deprived my face way too long. On day one of using this cream, I saw the hydration immediately in my face. In the morning my fave was very hydrated, lines softened and a lighter, healthier glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product and many more all from you for over 25 years and people are always asking me why I do not look my age which is 57 years old. One reason is your products and the other I do not wear face makeup everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I love the light scent of this when I put it on at night. When I get up in the morning my face fells so soft, but not greasy, and I actually do think that my skin looks smoother than it did before I went to bed. Even though I wash it off soon after I get up, I just feel like it gives my face a good start for the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After a long day on the ranch, a good night's sleep is important. This cream helps my face recouperate from the long day's work. I use it nightly to renourish my face, neck and decolete.

By the morning you'll notice your skin is deeply hydrated and ready for another day of putting your best face forward. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Regenerist Night Recovery Cream does come in a jar, so the potency of vitamin E, and green tea is compromised. This product also contains lavender and arnica extract. I believe it causes cell regrowth as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Regenerist Night Recovery Cream makes my skin so soft and smooth. I love the scent in it and the feel of my face after applying it each evening. It keeps my skin soft and supple all night long so when I wake up it is still working on my face and neck. I would recommend this product very hightly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like this nighttime facial cream it makes my skin soft. I like how I can apply it after I wash my face and go to bed and forget about it then wake up with new feeling skin. The only thing that I would change is I would like the option for a fragrance-free version because I'm sensitive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this before bed and night and I have fewer (or at least less noticeable) wrinkles and the lines from my nose to the corners of my both don't seem as deep. I've been using Regenerist products for several years and think my skin looks much younger than many women my age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Used nightly for years. I'm 60 years old now and still have people drop their jaws when I tell them. They ask me what's my secret and I tell them I've used Olay products since my 20s. At that time I was afraid of acne but not once had a breakout. Amazing wonderful company and products!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm 51 years old and everyone I come across is Shocked in how young I look. I have used your products since I was 18. Yes genes can contribute, but I firmly believe in .your products.

"I really love this night cream because it goes on smooth, is not too heavy, and does not leave residue on my pillows. It soaks in wonderfully to moisturize skin and leaves skin smooth, hydrated, and youthful looking. When I wake up in the morning, my skin feels amazing and the cream has worked wonders. I have been using this for years after cleansing my skin at night and I love to have it as part of my Regenerist routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is very moisturizing. I can still feel the smoothness on my face when I wake up in the morning. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that my skin get a little oily in the summer and I tend to wake up extra oily if I use too much. I just put on a very thin layer in the summer and it is better.

I use this every night.... it feels like silk when I apply it to my face and neck. I use this along with the Regenerist Cream in the red jar. I get so many complements on my skin and how young I look. I am 63 and no one believes me when I tell them. Everyone guesses I am 15 -20 years younger...can you believe it?! I definitely recommend this to my friends!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product and use it regularly as my night cream. Since using the Regenerist Night Recovery Cream my skin is much brighter, smoother and looks younger.

"I have been using Olay products for some time now and considering the compliments such as:""OH my God, I have not seen you for a couple of years and you have not changed a bit"" I must said that the products work.

"Since I retired 6 years ago and can no longer afford to buy some of the higher-priced beauty products in department stores, I started using Olay and am thrilled with the results from using Regenerist Night Recovery Cream.

I'm 73 years old and I owe so much to your products. I'm mostly grateful for the benefits I receive and the price point. Thank you, Olay, for your continued great products.

Recommended by my dermatologist to use Olay products as my skincare regime. I have been using Regenerist Night Recovery Cream for almost 6 months. My skin condition has definitely improved.

I love the way the night cream feels on my face and it soaks in very nicely. Doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy.

I have used this night cream for years. Night scent and texture. Doesn't make my skin oily like some other creams do. This also works well when I get too much sun on my face. Keeps my face from drying out until the burn has gone away. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've seen some bad reviews about eye irritation. As an RN of 15 years ANYTHING that exfoliates and regenerates skin cells SHOULD NOT be applied close to your eyes. I myself have VERY sensitive eyes so I dont apply the lotion above my cheekbone or lower than my eyebrow. This product when used correctly can work miracles. Bottom line is you MUST know your own skin BEFORE you apply ANYTHING to it. My personal experience with this product has been PHENOMENAL.
"The old formula plumped and hydrated, and never gave my acne-prone skin problems. The new formula wouldn't absorb and left a greasy film. Small white bumps all over. Weeks later, my skin looked dull and my breakouts were worse. Still check if the old formula is back every time I go to the store. Tons of reviews on other websites reflect that loyal users of the old night cream feel the same way."
"I absolutely love this night cream. I've tried Chanel and all of the way-too-expensive brands and this is just as good, if not better! The price is on point..but not so cheap that you are afraid to use it in fear that your face may fall off. I appreciate the quality and the affordability, as well as the results that I've been getting while using it. Thanks, Olay! Keep up the great work! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using Regenerist Night Recovery Cream and will never change. My skin is softer and healthier now after using the night cream. Wrinkles are less noticeable and I feel great about that. I'm very careful around my eyes and avoid getting to close as it made my eyes watery one time. Love this product as it does help to slow the aging of my skin.

"This facial cream is rich and silky and absorbs rather quickly into your skin. You immediately feel hydrated and , I kid you not, firmer and more beautiful. You skin radiates and feels very soft to the touch. Over time I definitely noticed my fine lines getting less visible. I use it liberally on my face, neck and décolletage.

"This product is really creamy going on, but quickly soaks into my skin at night, and is never greasy.

"I really like this product. i do not go to bed without applying it. i am 60 years old and have been using Olay products since they first hit the market.

I love the smoothness and non-oily feel of applying the night recovery cream just before bedtime. It just makes up for the dryness of my skin and exposure during the hot summer sun. My skin still feels silky when I wake in the morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is so smooth, I use it nightly on my face, neck and breast area. It seems to have smoothen out fine lines on chest especially as well as other areas.

Olay products really have helped my skin! I cannot ask for better!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for over a year, and am extremely pleased with its results.

"I have had very dry skin since I was a child. As a adult I began using the night cream and it has really made a difference in the appearance and texture of my skin. I would recommend this product, highly to anyone with very dry skin or over the age of 40 trying to keep young skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wanted to like this product more than I did. While it seemed to do a decent job of moisturizing, and did not leave a greasy feel, I really could not see much if any improvement in my wrinkles or my skin tone. It's not a bad product but I cannot see any substantive improvement after several weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I apply Olay's Regenerist Night Cream on a daily basis; not only at night, but also during the day after morning wash. I immediately notice that it leaves my skin feeling soft and at refreshed.

I also use other Olay products, but this one is my favorite. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Tried this cream and was very surprised how it made my skin feel. When I ran my hand over my cheek it was so very smooth. I recommend that everyone should try this before they go out and waste their money a more expensive cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have been using Olay products since I came to the US in 1976. I am over 60 years old now and when I am complimented about how young I look, I have always attributed my youthful looks to Olay. I particularly love renegerist products as I feel they help my skin look s youthful as it reduces the fine lines and wrinkles and seems to make my skin glow as it exfoliates, and brightens the skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I've been using this cream for about 5 years now and I just won't give it up. I've used very expensive ones previously, and they just don't compare to this night cream. I also use it for daytime.

"Love this night cream product because reduced my fine line, smooth my under eye wrinkles, and over all my skin tones smoother look younger. Great product for combination skin tones. It can be use morning and night too. I also treat it as eyes cream, save $ buy extra eye cream by using night cream around my eyes. I had use many different products, but Regenerist Night Recovery Cream is the best for my Asian skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have done through several bottles of Regenerist Night Recovery Cream. I find the product very moisturizing. I have a problem with dry skin but I also tend to be prone to breakouts and this does not break me out. I can't say I have noticed a reduction in wrinkles or fine lines from the product. That didn't happen until I added a retinol to my routine. Overall a good moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"One morning I was very surprised but pleased when my husband said that I always look pretty when I get up in the morning.

"My face feels so soft in the mornings, I wake up almost feeling 10yrs younger, and my daughter assures me that I actually do look younger than my age. Ago takes a toll even on the healthiest of women, and when 60 is just around the corner, one can never be too careful of the products you use on your face. That's why I trust Regenerist Night Recovery Cream to work its magic every night. I love this product, it has worked for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have used this Regenerist Night Recovery Cream for several years. It is light and non greasy. Most importantly, it does not irritate my very sensitive skin. I have tried another night time creams, but have always regretted the purchase. My face would break out or almost looked burned.

"High end moisturizers that you find at the department store cost about three times as much as this awesome moisturizer that you can find at the local drugstore.

Using these products with the exfoliating wash really helps to moisturizing your face and neck. You can feel it starting to tighten the skin. As I had stated with the exfoliating wash it has drastically changed the deep set wrinkles I have on my forehead and around my eyes. They seem to be as not deep set or furrowed. I have even had friends make comments about my wrinkles and recommended these products to them. I will definitely continue to use these products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"OLEY is good brand with very good products in general but because You've asked us to choose only one product, I've choosed Regenerist Night Recovery Cream. I still belive putting cream on your face for night resting is very important. Im using more than that. Also I like and use frecquently Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream. I can tell in my age of 71, my face skin is pretty good ! I appraise OLAY and your good cosmetics, no question about it . Thank You !!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"And I have tried many! This one feels light and clean, without all the gunk a lot of night moisturizers have, particularly moisturizers for more mature skin.

When I wake up in the morning after using this the night before my skin is so healthy looking . My makeup looks better because my skin actually feels firmer.

I have tried other night creams off and on and I always go back to Regenerist Night Recovery Cream.

"The Regenerist Night Recovery Cream has been one of my few skin-care regimen staples for the last decade, because it seems to work better than any other similar product I've tried. When used even 4-5 times a week it does wonders for my facial firmness and elasticity and helps to smooth out fine lines. I am often told I look young for my age (47) and I attribute it all to Regenerist! The product is silky-smooth, and is a small luxury even after the more stressful day.

"Have used Olay skin products for years...and have gradually changed my nightly facial routine from the ""original"" moisturizing lotion to your first night-time cream, to the Regenerist product that I think is Olay's BEST nightly facial ""treat"" EVER!

I have used Oil of Olay products for 31 years. This night cream adds lots of moisture to my face. My complextion seems to have a nice glow and fine lines are no more. My only concern is that the company may stop making this product someday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"What an awesome night cream!!!! You wake up with your skin so amazingly soft that you would think you had a spa treatment while you were asleep. This night cream moisturizes, smooths the skin, helps fight the lines and deep wrinkles on the face but don't forget''''use this night time moisturizer on your neck also. You want your neck too look amazing like your face does after using and LOVING this Olay Night Recovery Cream!!! Poor night time Luxury in a jar!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I Love the night time cream, regenerest , my face always feels so good when i put it on and it still looks so much better the next day, its not greasey and seems to absorbe right in and take away the dryness [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used Olay products since I was 18, and I love everything I've tried in the regenerist line, but it looks like there are many more I haven't tried yet! I'll have to look for more of them. The mysteries are great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product does not work as well for me as the micro-sculpting cream. It just does not seem to be absorbed into my skin and lays like a layer on top. I also can not use it all over, even my eyes as I can the micro-sculpting cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It does not take long to view the results of using this wonder skin rejuvenating cream. It feels good going on, and in the morning your skin appears younger, tighter and smoother. The value received for the price paid is incredible. Do not wait to see the benefits to you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used this product faithfully every night for the last year....I was a confirmed Avon Anew Product user previous to that....and I am so much happier with the results of you product........You have won me over! Thank you!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Received a sample of the overnight moisturizer. Skin felt so soft and smooth I didn't want to go to sleep because I wanted to show my face and skin off. Made my husband wash his hands and caress my face til I finally dozed off. Used the rest of the sample the next morning as well. Can't wait to try other products from Olay.....

I have used the Regenerist Night Recovery Cream for several years. I will be 80 in a couple of months and my skin is soft with very few wrinkles. No one can believe my age. I have recommended this to my daughters and their skin looks very nice also. I would highly recommend this product and a the Regenerist line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My skin drinks up this rich and creamy formula. Even if I take an overly hot shower, my skin is revived right away. I've stopped expecting miracles, but my face is certainly smoother and softer when I use this night cream. I've recommended it to friends and family. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream moisturizes without feeling greasy or tacky. I notice a difference in my skin, and if I forget to apply it, I can tell the difference in my looks as well as the tone of my face. It stops any swelling from sleeping that sometime occurred without it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product, my skin has regained some firmness and doesn't look as dull. I have noticed some dark spots have faded and fine lines as well. Being in my mid forties I have tried many different anti-aging products and so far this one is my favorite for overnight. I would definitely recommend this product.

"I have been using Olay products since I was 15 years old…I would never use anything else…My skin is never dry, but never oily…I use the day lotion and the night recovery lotion and am told my skin is young looking even though I am 59 years old…Olay is simply the best product on the market and I would use no other. I feel it has the test of time on it's side. It is both affordable and effective and what more could you ask of a skin product…I will only use Olay.

"The Regenerist Night Recovery Cream goes on very smoothly. It feels pleasant on my face. After a few nights of using this cream, I can see my fine lines becoming more diffused. My face feels so soft as well, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I feel that I cannot do without this product. It feels so lightweight yet it absorbs so easily into my skin leaving it with a soft and supple feeling. I always make sure I have it in my nightly routine stash because I almost can't sleep without it along with my lip balm that I keep handy in my bedside table. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Before bed I wipe my face down well to remove the daily junk and soak it in the Night Moisterizer..I truly believe it is helping to stop NEW wrinkles and at 76 that is really something..I believe my skin is healthier than others at my age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've only been using this product for a little over a week. I can already see and feel the difference. It is a great product. The only problem, I have very sensitive skin and would really like it if this product had a sensitive skin (no fragrance/dyes) formula. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this product for awhile I have noticed softer, firmer, moist skin. I have very dry skin and live in a harsh cold climate and this has really helped recover my skin softness and firmness, there is a softness in my fine lines and more moisture on my dry skin.

"I am approaching my 69th Birthday but my husband says I don't look near that age. I have to say it is probably due to using my regenerist cream. Yes, I still have wrinkles but they are not pronounced after I put on my face cream. Thank You for this wonderful product!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this product for years. I am allergic to some cosmetic ingredients and it is so difficult for me to find right product. Regenerist Night Recovery Cream is perfect for my skin. I've noticed that the formula was changed couple years ago, but it is still good for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was hesitant on getting any kind of night cream as I just figured they were all the same day/night.

"I started using Regenerist Night Recovery Cream almost three months ago. When I wake up in the morning, my skin is smooth and glowing.

I have been using this product since it came out. I am 70 years old and because of my skin I am always guessed at a younger age. Olay has been my regime since my early 20's. I highly recommend Olay for the softest skin you can imagine [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used the product since it came out and feel that I'm giving my skin the rich moisturizer needed along with keeping my wrinkles ""at bay"" from increasing. Using this along with the eye night cream I feel that I'm treating my skin with what is needed as I grow older and yet not breaking the bank with the cost of these. My mom always told me to take good care of my face and neck and I'm a good listener!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Regenerist Night Recovery Cream is truly the only cream I've ever used that yields visible results - literally overnight. When I remember to use it I'm always thrilled. It smells wonderful, immediately makes your skin feel moisturized, and when you wake up, yes you can see a difference. Fine lines seem to have disappeared and your complexion looks healthier.

"i love this product. After working all day whether at the office or outside on the farm, I wash my face and put this product on and my skin feels and looks refreshed, rejuvenated, and hydrated.

"Perhaps my skin is too far gone for this moisturizer to have any effect, but I was disappointed with lack of results after using for one month. I expected to see some reduction in lines and wrinkles, but I really cannot see any difference whatsoever. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The Regiene rest the night recovery cream is an amazing product. With all the stress of the day and natural aging you can play sis on your face before going to bed and wake up in the morning looking younger. My skin will feel much smooth move there and look less wrinkled. I love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Smells clean and feels light on the skin. A great night moisturizer to use for those worrying about wrinkles and the aging process. I wish it would come in a bigger container so it could last longer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product and use it for both night & day. It gives makeup a fantastic base, makes my skin feel smooth and just a bit firm. I have noticed an overall improvement in the appearance of my complexion since I have freckles. Just love all of the Regenerist products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been an Olay girl for many of my 66 years. I use the entire Regenerist line and was hard to choose one to review. I choose the night cream because I like they way it moisturizes my skin while I sleep. I wake up and my skin feels refreshed and soft! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Every night, before the stroke of the midnight hour, a transformation takes place. I use my Regenerist Night Recovery Cream and in the course of the night, I reverse the hands of time. My face returns to my looks of a younger year. My skin is much softer and the wrinkle lines are less pronounced. I would highly recommend the experience of using Regenerist Night Recovery Cream. It is a luxury that no one should miss. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have used Regenerist Night Recovery Cream for the last nine months each night on my face. My face feels so moisturized and fresh in the morning. I can tell such a difference in the lines and wrinkles around my eyes. My skin looks much like it did ten years ago! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used this product for several years now and it seems recently you switched the make up of the product. It used to be lavender in color and smelled nice. It's now white and the fragrance isn't nearly as pleasant. It also seems less creamy and thick. Please go back to your old formula! Thank you :-) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay's Regenerist Night Recovery Cream is the best! I have been using it for years, and wake up feeling great about my skins condition every morning. I spend a lot of time outdoors, and count on Olay's Regenerist products to keep my skin in it's best condition. I just turned 60, to the shock and surprise of many of my coworkers who insisted I was at least 10 - 15 years younger! Thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this cream because it is not greasy but makes my skin feel so soft and hydrated. I am 50 years old and of course I have some small lines and wrinkles but since I have been using this product, I have definitely noticed them less. I am not looking for a magical solution to look forever young but I do want to keep my skin looking fresh and not saggy. If you are looking for that too, this is the cream for you.

"If you like for your face to feel clean and soft, with the reduction of the appearance of lines, then this is the product for you. I began using the Regenerist before bed and then I noticed the SPF feature which made it ideal for day wear. So now, I use it morning and night and I am very pleased-you might even say trilled-with the results I have experienced in the recent past. Try it for yourself..it's great!

"I am 77 years old and with the Regenerist products ,my complexion is still clear and except for deep laugh lines, almost wrinkle free.

I just recently started using the Regenerist Night Recovery Cream and let's just say I'm really impressed! It goes on very smooth and silky and not at all greasy. In the morning my skin still feels really good. I'd say that's pretty fantastic for this 59 year old! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for about two months now. My skin felt smoother and softer immediately. After two months of use I notice that my deep wrinkles are less noticeable and the one surface wrinkle in between my eyebrows is only visible with a magnifying mirror. And all I had to do was go to sleep to get all of this. Perfect! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Love this cream. I have been using it for over 4 years and refuse to even try other products. Most of the creams I have used either moisturize too much and leave the skin looking greasy, while others leave the skin dry. This product is perfect. No greasy feeling and my skin looks and feels great the next morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product works great for overnight transformation! My skin looks and feels much softer. My fine lines seem to be less noticeable with regular applications. It is great to begin my morning facial routine with a fresher, smoother complexion. I am ready to apply my daily moisturizer and make-up with more confidence after using this product!

"Never has night repair felt so clean and comfortable. Regenerist Night Recovery smooths onto my skin with a clean refreshing feeling. It drinks in quickly and evenly leaving my face with a pliant, moisture-rich feel that isn't oily or greasy. Its almost as if I can physically feel its working. It even works well with the eye renewal gel. It is the only product I use regularly and people guess me 15 years or more younger than my true age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use the Regenerist Night Recovery Cream on my neck and face every night. I had some wrinkles on my forehead and a prominent crease between my brows. After about 2 weeks of every day use these lines were less prominent!! I also use a light moisturizer in the day, however, I have always used this. It wasn't until trying the night cream that I saw a difference in my skin. I love this stuff!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"For 30 years I used only Estee Lauder face products. I decided to try something new and decided on this night cream. I can't tell you how pleased I am with this product. It's half the price and twice the results. My skin radiates health and I swear I have less wrinkles than I did 30 years ago. Don't take my word for it, do yourself a favor and try it.

"This moisturizer has a light floral smell that is very relaxing at night. It is think, but not heavy or greasy. After 1 night my skin was better hydrated and after 2 nights I thought it looked brighter and my makeup went on smoother (I use a CC cream in the morning under my makeup). I am hoping for an improvement on my fine lines by the time the jar is empty. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Olay Night Recovery Cream for at least 30 years now and it constantly impresses me with the results. I am in my sixties and still get compliments on how great my skin looks.

"Ladies, first I want to say that I learned how to use Olay products from my mom. She is s loyal customer for over 20 years. I bought this product as an emergency night cream while on vacation. OMG, my skin was so smooth after just one night. I loved that it was silky but not sticky. I couldn't believe that I noticed the change in my skin so quickly. I have recommended this cream to all my friends and family. My husband has even used it! I love it! You will not be disappointed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This is an effective pm moisturizer to have smoother suppler skin. I use after evening shower to seal in the moisture before bed. I have had good results of softer skin and perhaps it does keep the lines from increasing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product goes on silky smooth and makes your face feel baby soft. When you wake up the next day you feel like you had a quenching bath on your face. I can't go without using it.

I like the cream very much - good overnight moisturizer - BUT I wish it was available in fragrance free like a lot of the other Regenerist products. The fragrance is too strong and annoying. I've been using this and other Olay products for many years and I think the fragrance has gotten stronger lately in this cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After washing my face each night I always put on the Night Recovery Cream. It is light and creamy, smooths on easily and does not feel greasy. It goes right into my skin and it feels softer and keeps my skin looking younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this cream every night. It leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated. I wake up actually looking like I had a ton of sleep, even if I hadn't!! It doesn't leave my face feeling oily and does not contain an overbearing scent. This is a such a ""plus"" in a night cream. Thank you OLAY!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the last regenerist night cream that I purchase. I LOVED the old formula. It was velvety, more effective and super moisturizing. This new formula is stickier and leaves a ""film"" behind. I gave it a shot and have gone through 3... I'm done. Its not great at all."
"I loved this cream before they released the 'improved' version last year. I find it does not go on as smoothly and cakes up. Also, if you should wear it during the day it does not work under make up. The old version I would give an 'A' to but the newer version I would grade with an 'F' and will not purchase again."
"What happened to the lavender cream??? I LOVED the lavender cream. I have used it for years and recommended to friends. This new product is sticky, offensive smell, and oily. Not nearly the product it was. Please bring back the old product. WHY did you change it... I have read several reviews dissatisfied with the new product. Is there a way to purchase the old product if so please let me know."
"Sometimes you should just leave well enough alone! The new formula is completely different and therefore I won't be using this product any longer. The original formula was super hydrating, smelled good and felt AMAZING. The new formula has a different smell and doesn't go on as smoothly or feel as hydrating. Please bring back the original formula!"
"Like others, I do not care for the new formulation. I have used Olay Regenerist for 10 years, and I loved it! The creaminess and the smell were soothing. The new formulation is sticky. Please bring back the old formulation...or at least make it available for those of us who are faithful. Please???"
I'm so disappointed that Olay would change the formula. I recommended the older formula to everyone. It was so good. I tried the new formula and it's not as effective and does not even come close to comparing to the other formula. I'm still hunting for a new cream. Can't find one that works like the Oaly old formula.
"Olay, I hope you are reading all these negative reviews about your new formula for this regenerist night cream!! It used to be my favorite- so buttery and yummy smelling. Now it is sticky and sharp smelling. I literally have to wash my hands after applying it! Please please PLEASE change it back, or repackage the old formula!!"
I used the old light purple Regenerist Night Recovery cream for years and loved it. Olay changed the formula sometime in late 2013 or 2014. Now it's white. It peels off my face. Don't like it. Won't use it. Likley will change brands completely. Would love for Olay to bring back the old formula. Reading reviews online there seem to be lots of women who want the same thing.
I used to love this product. I have used it for the last several years. It has been reformulated and I do not like the new formula. It is now sticky and doesn't feel like it absorbs into my skin well. It used to go on like butter and feel amazing. I will not be buying this new formula again. Plz bring back the old formula.
"The new formula is terrible. The smell is offensive, it doesn't soak in and my skin is dry and tight in the morning. I NEVER had that issue with the old formula. It was amazing; why change it?! You let me down, Olay. I'm now on the hunt for a new night cream and it won't be anything from your line."
"I don't know why the formula was changed! This night cream was the lightest, least oily cream I've used. I'm very disappointed in the new formula, which is scented differently, heavier, and left my face oily upon application and the next morning. I had used the previous product for years."
"I have used and loved this product for over 10 years. Imagine my surprise when I opened my new jar to see a formulation change. I won't be purchasing again - or even finishing the jar. It is oily and peels off my skin when I rub it in. Such a disappointment. Why the change, Olay??"
"Having used this for overnight for long time, I was extremely disappointed to find that when I opened a new jar, the product has changed! It is no longer light and moist. the color and the texture have changed to be more like the cream in the red jars that I cannot use as they are too thick and cause skin eruptions. Why was this product changed?"
I recently bought the regenerist night cream. I have been using it for a week and am already seeing a difference. I can still feel the moisturiser on my skin when I wash my face in the morning. Usually my skin is so dry it would all be soaked up. My face feels softer and I even think my neck looks tighter.
"Very, very good cream. I really can't tell the difference between this cream and the regenerist cream that can be used day and night, but both make your skin feel super super smooth and soft. It feels silky almost instantaneously right after you apply it. Definitely recommend it to everyone!"
"I am a huuuge Olay fan. Been using it since i was 18 jeje, I'm 31 and i receive a lot of compliments on my skin at work, they've even asked me what i use. Obviously I say proudly :OLAY!! jeje. Excellent night cream, I wake up feeling my skin soft and my fine lines are diminishing. I know everybody is gonna have signs of aging as they grow older, but Olay really helps a lot to slow down the age effect jejejejej THANKS OLAY!!"
I have only been using this cream for about 2 weeks and my skin is already showing vast improvement. My face is so silky smooth even after I wash it. I have dry skin and all the dryness has vanished leaving my face as smooth as babys skin. No other cream has done this well. This one is a keeper!
I started using Oil of Olay Regenerist night cream about 4 years ago. I am 52 now. This night cream smells good and makes your face feel so good as you are laying down to go to sleep at night. I believe it helps lessen the effects of aging. My friends and family say I am aging well!
"I decided to cut back and instead of purchasing department store products, I purchased Oil of Olay Regenerist. I had used it a long time ago in my late teens and early 20s. I love it even better than the department store stuff, and I have tried most. The Regenerist product soaks in and actually moisturizes my skin day and night, without the shine that I get from all other moisturizers. I love it. My skin looks so much more vibrant and hydrated."
"I have been using this for about 2 years now. This is a great night cream. My skin actually LOOKS AND FEELS silky-soft and smooth each morning; so much so, my husband has been using it a few nights as well! lol He commented on how great my skin looked the very first week I had used it and I have been using it ever since. I don't know what a mini-life is, but with this, I don't think I will be needing one! ;)"
"With chronic insomnia, I need a night moisturizer that not only works well but also has a calming effect when I use it. This product does both! Not only does it moisturize my skin but the light fragrance and the lavender colored jar induce a feeling of calm that helps me fall asleep much easier. I know the product isn't meant to induce sleep, but for me it works and that's very important!"
My wife has encouraged me to use her creams over the past several years and I've had mixed results. She bought me my own bottle of this and it is great. My skin glows and looks very healthy. As a businessman I'd encourage Olay to make travel sizes and airport friendly versions. thanks
It's a nice light night cream that's not too expensive.
"Love it! This night cream makes my skin soft, young looking, and smells great!"
"I find the night cream lite and finishes without an oily residue, however I'm still waiting on results it has been only two weeks."
"This feels and smells great. But, It literally flaked off my face, and into my hair- after several times of trying. It doesn't absorb at all, unfortunately."
"I usually use higher end products but opted to give this a try. It goes on smoothly but does have a very waxy feel. Also when you touch your face, there is alittle bit of a sticky texture."
One of the best things about this product was the soft calming scent which made it so relaxing at bedtime. Now it's just boring and a bit waxy. So disappointed that the formula changed. Why can't you provide an option for scented or fragrance free?
"I have been using this for years. I loved the soft fragrance, now the formula is different. It doesn't seem as creamy and it is fragrance free. Now I've got to start the search for something else."
I purchased Night Recovery Cream as I couldn't find my former product. Not the same thing... different consistency and scent. Will be looking for something else!
"Been using this for many, many years. Tried other brands and other Olay types, but this is the best for me. Keeps skin moisturized during the night and wake up with soft skin."
"Don't know what Olay did to their night recovery cream but it is awful. It is too thick, doesn't absorb and leaves a mess on my pillows. Bring back the previous product. Will be using another brand until they bring it back."
"This is an amazing night cream —not greasy or heavy feeling. After using this cream every night for about three weeks, I am noticing that my skin appears brighter. Thank you so much for providing a quality fragrance free product."
Please bring back the old product it helped my skin so much. This one is not the same feel or texture at all and leaves my skin feeling greasy! How do we get the old product back??
"Now it's awful. Used this product foe a couple years, it absorbed into skin quickly and left my face felling silky. Now it leaves an unpleasant greasy residue that I can't wipe away with tissue.. Yuck."
"I've been using the original night recovery cream for over 20 years. This is not the same. Not at nice and light and more expensive. Seriously, costs at least 30% more. Very disappointed. Bring back the original, please."
Why did you change the old formula and go fragrance free? The new one doesn't feel the same and the smell of the old one was an extra bonus of using it! Why can't you have a fragrance free and a regular fragrance? Why mess with a good thing?

"I just lost 113 lbs and I have been worried about having a case of ""droopy face"". So I wanted to firm my skin. I got this product a week ago and it is AMAZING! I look so great! I would recommend this product to anyone."
"I use this cream every night and it is amazing!! It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth and glowing!! I don't think I could live without this cream!! Olay, thank you!!"
"this stuff works great with oily skin. every morning i wake up my skin looks bright, refreshed and i have fewer breakouts. i use this along with the regenerist serum. its only been a few weeks and i have had great results."
"This is a great night moisturizer. My skin feels so good in the morning that on days when I don't need to go out, I use it again instead of ""day cream"", too. It has really helped keep my skin feeling soft and elastic."
"This is without a doubt the best night treatment I have ever tried, and I've tried many. It's very smooth, it smells delicious and it does not feel heavy at all.I use it every night and love it. I would recommend it to everybody."
I have tried so many skin care products. Oil of Olay is by far the best I've ever used. And I really notice the difference when I stop using it. My fine lines reappear and my skin doesnt feel healthy.
"I like the look and feel of this night cream, it definitely does job while i'm sleeping. I use this in conjunction with Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Face for daytime moisturizer and the two together are doing great for my complexion. I apply this on my face, neck and chest--I've used this for about a week now and love how my face looks in the morning when I get up; no more tired looking skin, I'm still waiting to see if it will tighten my loose skin around my neck, probably give it another three weeks for that."
"I love this product, I really notice how much softer my skin is in the morning."
This product is different than the original. I do not like it. Feels greasy! Bring back original formula!!!
I agree with the previous comments. . . the older version that was literally lavender in color with a great smell was SO much better!
I am very disappointed that you have taken the fragrance out of this product. It does not seem the same anymore!
"I LOVED the old formula, why did you change it? More money for nothing! I want the old purple formula back, you can just keep this one!"
