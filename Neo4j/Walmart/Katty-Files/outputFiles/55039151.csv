"I used a bottle of this, tried a different brand, and ended up switching back. After using this for a few weeks my skin is noticeably smoother, softer and my tone is more even. I've got seborrhea but this moisturizer is gentle enough for my sensitive skin. SPF coverage is great too. It can streak white when you first put it on, but as others have said, only use a half pump (resist the urge to double pump!) and treat yourself to a mini face massage and it's no problem. One bottle lasts me 4-6 months. LOVE IT."
"This is my first time using any skin product from Burt's. I purchased because of the Royal Jelly as I am a fan. I didn't read the label to note that the SPF is Titanium Dioxide--hence the white face--need to fully rub in. The SMELL however, is not good. It does seem to dissipate as it soaks into skin but it frankly Stinks. This needs to be improved upon without extra added artificial fragrance."
This seems more like a poorly made sunscreen than a daily lotion/ moisturizer product. It's completely liquid and wasn't what I was looking for at all
"I recently purchased several items from the Skin Nourishment product line. The Day Lotion is the only one that I am returning. I LOVE the other products in this line. The Day Lotion feels more like sun block than a moisturizer. It is heavy, almost pasty and it smells rather musky. The worst part is It turned my skin pearly white. Even after I applied makeup, my face still looked pale. There are other Burt's Bees moisturizers that I will return to. This one is not for me."
"I was pleasantly surprised by this product because I've tried many alternatives and nothing fit my needs like this! My skin feel nourished, and it not only has titanium dioxide, but has enough to be effective in helping prevent skin damage--a skilled dermatologist once told me TD is the best ingredient to look for in SPF. YAY for ingredients gentle enough to use daily on clean skin! Please don't ever stop making this product :)"
I was so excited to try a day lotion with royal jelly and even calendula extracts. I've tried many prestigious products with these ingredients and when I found this Day lotion I thought it might be a more affordable comparison. Everyone's skin is different but for me it left a white blotchy film on my skin. It didn't absorb at all and just sat on my face. I might recommend this to someone with extremely oily skin. However for me it made my skin feel dry and look gross.
"First off, I've used Burt's products for many years. I have used the Radiance line for over a decade and absolutely loved it. Day cream, night cream and eye cream, all part of my daily routine. This new day lotion is terrible! It smells awful, feels like putting sun screen on my face and leaves a white film! Even with foundation applied it makes my face look pale. I don't understand the change...PLEASE go back to the former royal jelly line of products and packaging!!"
"I'm an avid burts bees user. Face wash, baby products, lip care, etc. I've been using the sensitive face lotion and my skin was really dry still. So I though I'd give this one a try. The smell isn't pleasurable but I can get past that. It's the weird white film it leaves. I looked pale even with my foundation on. And it's heavy. I feel like I'm wearing loads of makeup when it's just a moisturizer. Didn't work for me at all."
"I wish I had read reviews of this product before I purchased it. The lotion sits on top of the skin and won't absorb, not matter how much you massage it in. It also smells strange and gives the skin a pale purple hue. I would not recommend this product to anyone."
"Bought this looking for a better day lotion, and had been pleased with Burts Bees lip balm, so I figured I'd give this a try. Can't even put this on my face because of the stench. There's something in it (honestly, it smells like mildew) that triggers a migraine for me. Can't take it back either. Absolutely do not recommend."
"I knew this product contains SPF 15 so I thought it would be a good daily face lotion, but when applying a small amount on my face, the product leaves a white film. I try gently working in the lotion, but then the lotion cakes up, and leaves more streaky white film & pills on my face. I have to complete remove it."
"I will use it for my legs at night, but won't put it on my face again."
Thought it would be like the original it won't absorb into the skin like the original I don't feels moisturized. Seems as if it just sits on my face and makes me look extra oily. Makes my face very pale and shiny. So sad I'm going to have to find a new one but you do have loads of products hopefully I find one that works like the this on used to .
"This day lotion is light and great for moisturizing my skin during the day. It also has the added bonus of providing sun protection for my skin during the day. I'm always out and about so this helps a lot. It also worked well for my skin which is combo, more oilier during the summer but a bit dryer during the winter. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Was so excited for a daily moisturizer, the product smells strange and leaves white residue. Also when I try and put on foundation after using the lotion-even after a good amount of time the foundation and the lotion don't mix well and cause lumps together"
"This product has a powerful. odd odor. In fact I've had to apply fragrance oil just below my nostrils to tolerate the smell. Also, adds a white layer to my face. Love Burt's Bees - just not this product. I wish I could have smelled it before purchase however the box was sealed."
I was looking a product with spf for day use as the one I used for years changed to no spf. I know Burts are great so I tried this day lotion. I have had it for four days and do not think I will use it as I cannot tolerate the smell of it. Maybe others don't mind but no odor would be better than the off odor of this lotion.
I do not like the smell. It stinks! I also don't like that it turns my face white. The old version of the Day Cream (the one in a jar) was so much better! These glass bottle pumps are really wasteful too. I can't get all the product out of them! It there a day cream that doesn't turn your face white? I used to swear by Burt's Bees products and I now cannot.
"I don't really understand all the negative reviews. My guesses are people are using too much product (one pump is actually more than you need for your face but I use it on my neck, too), and aren't rubbing it into their skin properly. It leaves my skin feeling soft and never oily or greasy, and I like the smell. I also like that it has a thin consistency so it blends easily and quickly into the skin. But you have to work with it a bit--don't just put it on and barely rub it in or put on too much or it will feel too heavy on the face."
"Very natural, doesn't bother my sensitive skin. Blends right in and gives a nice glow. Smells very natural as well and I love It. I use it every morning and it leaves me feeling moisturized throughout the day."
"eureka I have found it....smooth glides on skin, this light weight moisturizer with a decent spf factor. No worries about the slightly white look which absorbs into the skin , it is the ""natural"" sunscreen which is a physical barrier"
This is a nicely scented moisturizer that is non greasy. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it wasn't quickly absorbing and you had to rub it in for a bit. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The first day of using this product I got little bumps all over my face and I discontinued using it but the bumps are still there and it's painful now. I have no idea what to do
"I was loved using the day cream before the formula was change. I dont usually wear makeup only sunblock and burt bees powder, but using this sunscreen makes my face look too white."
"I love Burt's Bees, but I am not a fan of this. The smell is way too strong and with my sensitive skin it broke me out. The white cast left by it was intense. I have fair skin and it left me looking even more ghost-like than normal. #thankyounext"
"I had high hopes for this product because I really liked the eye cream with royal jelly. But this left white residue all over my face, neck and hands. My face felt “dirty” or clogged up, not a lightweight lotion. I also had to apply another lotion just so my face didn't feel/look dry. Overall, I'm very disappointed, as I really like Burt's Bees products. Would like to return."
"Normally I love Burt's Bees products but this lotion left me disappointed. It left a white, flaky residue on my skin and no matter what amount of the lotion I use, it doesn't go away. The smell is also not for everyone, although it goes away after a bit. Upset because it was so expensive."
"i thought i was buying a moisturizer, but its quite literally runny sunscreen? it feels like sunscreen, it goes on quite thick, dont try to smooth it out cuz its not going anywhere. i knew it had some sunscreen in it, but i didnt expect my skin to look purple."
"I didn't like it at all. First of all, when you dab a small drop of the lotion on your face it comes on too white. Secondly, the formula feels too heavy - doesn't absorb easily in the skin. I had to really rubbed it in to make it disappear. Lastly, I was beginning to break out in a small rash, so I discontinued using it. I will search for another moisturizer that is light and blends well."
"The first thing I noticed was the smell...it smelled like bleach or some sort of cleaner. I inhaled it after putting it on my face and the smell was so strong it made me cough. It turns my face white. It doesn't absorb into the skin and leaves your face with a white film on it as if you didn't rub in your sunscreen well enough. I had to wipe it off my face and it turned the washcloth white too. After applying it to my face, my fingers felt sticky and had a weird film layer on them. Not a good product, will be returning."
"Though I generally love Burt's Bees products, this is one I don't care for. The lotion has a strong scent, does not apply easily, and leaves a white residue everywhere, including the palms of my hands! Though the whiteness does fade within a minute or two, I'd describe that my skin looks a bit ""pearly"" for the rest of the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a big fan of most Burt's Bees products, but I just can't get past the smell of this lotion. The consistency is fine and works well over the Burts Bees Nourishing Facial Oil, but the smell if just off. I'll finish what I have but I won't be purchasing this item again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It turned my face purple and feels dry, basically the same stuff other reviewers I leaving"
Great all day coverage. Love that it has an SPF. A little thick but a little goes a long way. One pump covers my whole face.
Love how it doesn't clog my pores and feels so light weight! The fragrance smells great! I hope for more royal jelly products are to come!
"The smell is so horrible,that I can't use it. It doesn't smooth on and absorb well. I am so disappointed, I paid a lot for this. Just terrible."
"I love the white color in creams, sunscreen, serum, this lotion of Burt's Bees is medicinal, helps control acne, for bee honey that is astringent, Burts products is ideal."
This cream doesn't absorb into the skin and doesn't moisturize at all. It left streaks on my face and was irritating to my skin. I washed it off shortly after putting it on. Useless and expensive purchase!
This is a great face moisturizer! It has a light floral scent & spf 15. One pump is plenty to cover my whole face & my face isn't left too dry or oily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've tried to use this moisturizer several times over the last few weeks but it doesn't absorb properly and I can't get past the awful smell. I've wiped it off my face each time because the smell is so offensive. My husband thought that it smells rancid. Waste of money :(
"This is the second moisturizer I am trying. It feels so much lighter and non greasy compared the last one. The smell really isn't all that bad. I was expecting something foul when I read the reviews but it is very subtle and if I use face wash beforehand the scent of the face wash overpowers it. I've only used it a few times, but I'm hoping its something I can use longterm."
"Bought this product two days ago and I really want to love it but I'm experiencing the similar issues, it feels heavy and it leaves me with a white film. I have darker skin and I look like a ghost. I read one review that perhaps we are using too much.. will try but I'm disappointed so far."
"I could not wait to try Burts Bees products. I started with the day lotion and the night cream. I love the night cream, odorless, however, the day cream absolutely stinks. I am trying to get through the bottle but I don't think I can. Why does it smell so bad?"
I've tried many Burt's Bees products over the years and loved them all. This is the first one I've not liked at all. The moisturizer is sticky and leaves a weird white sheen on your skin--no matter how much you rub it it. I absolutely will not buy this again.
This lotion is great for my active lifestyle. It is sweat proof and the SPF keeps me protected. I use it on a regular basis so I don't think twice about sunscreens now on my face.
Not heavy and feels silky when going on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have always enjoyed burta bees products. 8 bought this day lotion because I wanted a moisturizer that nourished my skin will still keeping it protected from the sun. Overall, I really enjoy that way the product works, however, it is really difficult to use because of the smell. It is really strong and not that pleasant. I'm frustrated that I paid for a higher end, natural, product only to not be able to finish it because of the smell."
I've been using this day lotion for about six weeks. I always make sure there is an SPF in the moisturizers that I use. Usually when there is an SPF there is a slight white cast when you first put the lotion on and this is the case with this lotion as well however it absorbed into the skin quickly and leaves my skin feeling very nicely moisturized. My only wish is that the SPF was a little higher like 30. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"If there is any question about whether or not there is sunscreen in this product, you will have your answer after your first application -- make sure you rub it all in! :) It's a light lotion that works well as a base under makeup that still hydrates, even with sunscreen in it! Would definitely recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was pleased how quickly this day lotion with SPF protection absorbed into my skin. Upon first applying this I thought it would feel greasy but that was not the case. This left my skin feeling supple and ready for whatever the day will bring. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I did have a hard time rubbing this lotion into my face when I used it. I wonder if it has something to do with the fact that there is an SPF15 in it. With that being the case though, I do appreciate that there is an SPF in this lotion, because I don't always find it in lotions and it is important to have on everyday. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Does nothing for the skin except leave a nasty smell.
"its not a day lotion, just a sunscreen. i wpuld not use this on dry skin."
"Perfect day lotion, it has SPF 15, not greasy and is lightweight to wear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was not too fond of the smell of this product, especially with using it on my face. The moisturizer was difficult to rub in, and it left a gray layer on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The smell of this product is bad - like its spoiled. Could it be expired? Wish I would have tried something else, but was looking for some cleaner products to use."
I wanted to love this product but no matter how much I rub in the moisturizer I end up with a white powdery residue on my face. It was so bad the other day I had to wash again to get it all off mid makeup routine.
The great thing about this product you don't have to use much with the oil it makes your skin nice and fresh for the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This is an okay product. Since it has SPF in you really have to rub it in or else you'll have a white face. Also, it has a funky smell to it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a great moisturizer and sunscreen. YES - it goes on white. But it goes away after about a minute. Highly recommended. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The Skin Nourishment Day Lotion from Burts Beed is a miracle healer for dry skin. I've had rough patches on my face. I have always experienced very dry skin. I love the fact that it has spf15 and protects my skin from harmful Ray's. I've used this lotion on my recent trip to the beach. I would recommend this lotion to my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This lotion is amazing! I love that it has an SPF of 15 so I don't need to worry about skin damage when I am running my day to day life. This scent is gently and the lotion is super thick or too runny. It keeps my skin moisturized without it making it oily. I highly recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this Skin Nourishment Day Lotion in exchange for my review from Burt's Bees. First, I love that it has SPF in the formula as it's extremely important to me to wear sunscreen daily. It's a think formula, so it should be used with a light. It didn't irritate my skin and I felt like my skin was moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the same moisturizer for years until I got the Burt's Bees skin nourishment day lotion w/ spf 15. I like that the lotion is in a pump bottle, lightweight and has some sun protection. After using it for a week I feel a difference in my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried many lotions on my face with spf and a lot of times they have a weird texture on my skin but not this lotion, this lotion absorbs nicely on my skin and doesn't feel greasy or heavy. I would definitely highly recommend it. I received this product complimentary to try and review and all opinions expressed are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer made my skin a bit oily (normal) but it was very thick and sticky when I was applying it. Not sure if I was somehow applying it wrong. It didn't seem to absorb into the skin, more like a sunscreen than moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using t Skin Nourishment Day Lotion w/SPF15 for I et a week and my skin it super soft after using the cream , leaving me with a fresh smell and not oily at all, and you just have to use a little bit it expands really well I'm obsessed with this lotion , I love the I can trust burtsbees for a healthy product with out all those harmless chemicals [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although I haven't tested it's spf powers, I'd hazard to guess that it's a great barrier. It has a strong ‘clay' component that is a bit difficult to blend in. You can feel it in the texture of the lotion. Despite this it is a thin liquid. I need to really prime the pump to get it to dispense, but have no problems with it since. It smells a little off, but that's a small trade-off for natural ingredients. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free sample of the skin nourishment lotion and it is great. I have sensitive skin and it did not irritate or make me breakout. It is very light and glides on easy. Two downfalls though first, it left me with a really pale complexion. Second, I didn't care for the smell. For those two reasons I will not make it my everyday moisturizer but will wear it on days I wear makeup or just need a light sunscreen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I REALLY like this lotion. It's very light on the skin which is great for 90 degree weather, but the scent is a little too strong for me. If scents aren't a problem for you, I would HIGHLY recommend this lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like Burts Bees daily lotion to use under my make up or to put on my arms before going outside. I burn easy so I always have to use some kind of protectant. At least with this lotion I don't need a sunscreen too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recently received skin Nourishment day lotion w/spf15 and I love it. Keeps your skin smooth and hydrated and protects your skin from the sun. I would definitely recommend this product. I've told some of my friends and family and they plan on trying it for them selves . Very happy with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At first I was unsure of this product because it slathers on an opaque white like sunscreen. But it rubs in well and is a great midweight moisturizer- with the benefit of sunscreen but not the oily feeling. It does smell a bit odd, I guess from the royal jelly? But it's not bad, just different. Overall I've been using it regularly after receiving a free bottle and I like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't sure what to expect when I first used this lotion. It came out very liquid however once I put it on, I realized how nourishing it was. This lotion provides a wonderful amount of moisture and has sunscreen so I don't have to use another form of sun protection. I love how it makes my skin feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am in my 60's and try to keep my face moisturized first thing in the morning, during the day and in the evening. I have used this product for some time now and always happy with the way it feels on my face as well as how it protects my skin in the sun. I will continue to buy this product again."
"As a teenager and first starting out with skin care, Burt's Bees was my go to for natural skin care. I haven't used it for a while and decided to give this one a shot remembering how much I loved the sensitive skin line. Upon applying it, my face got a little warm but nothing painful. I then read the ingredients and saw there is aluminum in it! I'm so sad because I really liked that it had SPF 15 which would be perfect for my skin! unfortunately this will be returned. so disappointed."
I recently bought this product hoping to find the perfect daily moisturizer. First time using it I noticed the smell. It was horrible. It smells as if something in the lotion expired. It also leaves your face looking white. When it dries you can tell it is just sitting on your skin and that it didn't soak into your skin. I love Burt's bees products but where did y'all go wrong with this one?
"I'm terribly lazy and rarely ever put on sunscreen/block even though I know I definitely should. It's just too much work to find one that doesn't make my face an oil slick so I was looking forward to trying it. I'm pleased with how this lotion made my face feel and the smell, as well! It didn't leave to strong of a white cast on my face, either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Good face lotion - smooth, rubs in quickly, no real scent, not too heavy for the day, but moisturizing. The thing I hate? It puts a white cast on my skin. I'm already a porcelain skinned girl. Buying foundation is a two hour drama - everything is too dark or too yellow or too red. After about 30 mins the white cast wasn't apparent, but upon foundation application, I looked paler than normal. I'll wear this at home only, I don't particular care for looking so pale/sickly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a light, slightly liquid-y moisturizer (particularly compared to other Burt's Bee's facial moisturizers) that is great for warmer weather or layering on top of another product. Really happy to see this added to the Burt's Bees moisturizers! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only wear moisturizer with an SPF of 15 or greater and this fits the bill. It just takes a small amount to cover your whole face and neck. Because of the sunblock component it leaves kind of a whitish cast to your face unless you rub it in really well, but if you do that it is fine. It doesn't feel greasy at all. I would purchase this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked this day lotion. It didn't leave my skin feeling sticky, which can be a problem with some day lotions. It only takes a small squirt of the lotion for my whole face, which is also nice. I recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"It's great for me as a daily lotion with enough SPF and a little bit coverage~ I use after toner and serum, than apply a thin layer finished powder as my daily routine skincare."
I love this product. By far one of my favorites!! I will not ever use any other moisturizer. This is perfect with my face and works well with my makeup! Lovee it!

I bought this because of the SPF 15 but it was very disappointing! It doesn't absorb in the skin and it leaves the skin dry and pale. The smell is not at all pleasant either. I regret buying this moisutizer.

We live on the coast and I don't wear sunscreen daily except for when I'm going to spend the day at the beach. I used this on my daughter who is six and has very sensitive skin and it worked perfect, as well as on myself. I used on our face, ears, neck and our shoulders. No burns and we looked, smelled and felt amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't mind the smell as much as other reviewers. It's a little odd but quickly disappears. The reason for my one-star review is the consistency.. The lotion leaves a white sheen in my face, and feels greasy. I love love the royal jelly night cream, but the day lotion is not something I would recommend."
