"The first thing I noticed about this product was the packaging. It was incredibly fun and reminded me of spring. After smelling it, I was hooked. The lavender spray is so refreshing and gentle on my skin. I love to use it right before bed!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product smells amazing!! It was my first time using this product and I liked how gentle it was and how it helped my face brighten after a long day of work! I would definitely recommend this product to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Excellent formula and product. I've tried everything from St. Ives to Glow Recipe to La Mer. This product works well, and zero breakouts since I began using it."
The scent of this product is simply unmatched. I love the feel of this product and the refreshing experience. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this before I put on my makeup and after I wash my face anytime during the day! It automatically makes my skin feel refreshed and not dry like it has been. Ive reached for it more than I thought I would and I truly will be keeping this as a staple! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love facial mist! Feels good on skin and doesnt make face feel sticky after spraying. For the price this is a good buy and a must have! I have really sensitive skin and these met my expectations! I recommend others to try. I gave it a 4 star because I felt the lavender smell was a bit too much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product smells great and is hydrating. Its nice to use before doing makeup. But I dont recommend it for use after using makeup, I find it makes my makeup wear off faster. I have sensitive skin, and did not find it to be irritating so thats a plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a nice facial mist. The scent is nice and the nozzle has a nice even spray and a very fine mist! I really like the packaging and price as well. Was it amazing and life changing? No. Will I be trying other things from the brand and other facial sprays from the brand? Yes. Recommend for the other drugstore lovers out there! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"VERY little fragrance. More like vanilla than lavendar. No lavendar in ingredients... Water, parfum. It's a face spray but it says don't get in eyes. You can close your eyes but it's gonna get in there."
"I really wanted to like this product. However, I am very sensitive to scents and the lavender scent was overpowering. I couldn't use it more than once because the scent lingered. If you're sensitive to scents, smell it before you buy it! I would not purchase this even though this is a brand I enjoy, and I really like that they are trying to go toward the more natural route. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Omg, strong fragrance smelling. After using, it gave my skins a smell like using body mist. My face is saved by it whenever i went back from home during the cold weather in upstate new york a few weeks ago. Definitely buying it later. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the mister on this bottle it was such a better mister than the Mario badescu rose spray however I felt that this spray was too perfumey and I wish it smelled more of a natural lavender scent. I will continue to use but I think ill try a different scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loveee this face mist!! It smells so good and is very refreshing! Super gentle on my sensitive skin! When my face feels dry throughout the day I spray this and feel super refreshed! Ill purchase this again for sure! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this is a good product but its a little bit too smelly for me. The price range seems decent, and it does leave my Face feeling nourished and fresh. I do like the packaging, its very beauty. I think I would buy this again, hopefully if the price wasnt too expensive [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really liked the mist! It was the perfect combination of relaxing and refreshing. I also loved how it wasn't too overpowering and was still gentle on my skin. It can be used at all times of the day and really adds a smile to your face. I would highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a super fun and energizing scent. Perfect for a quick spritz during the day, after a work out or to refresh your makeup! I keep it in my gym bag and use it post workout!! I think it helped with extra hydration to the skin. The spray is a bit aggressive on the face, wish it was a little gentler. But overall, def recommend if youre looking for a new face mist! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the packaging and scent of this face mist! Definitely a nice quick and refreshing way to add moisture! Great price and easy to find in stores too! Would use again, highly recommend this brand and scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Super cute packaging. Looove the spritzer. The spray leaves me feeling refreshed and I cant wait to give it a try during hot summer days. It does have a bit of a strong scent though, and its a really good one just a tad overwhelming at times. I received the prod free from Influenster for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOOOOOVE THIS!!!!!! I love the scent, my skin feels refreshed, and my stress melts away. Very gentle on my skin and the scent is just strong enough. Beautiful packaging& I will for sure be buying this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoy how this mist is very gentle to the skin and refreshing when using it. The only thing that was a negative was how strong the scent is. Overall, I really appreciate how there is a cheaper version to some high end dupes to this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The smell is amazing gives me that instant stress relief that I need throughout the day. I am able to rehydrate without looking oily which is a plus since I have oily skin. Overall it acts like most facial sprays but I love this one for the price point and smell. I was given this for free but I will likely buy it once I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product absolutely blew me away. The scent is amazing, the ingredients are somewhat natural, and it made me feel hydrated, refreshed, and relaxed. This isnt too zen; its a soothing mist for any time of the day. i wear it under makeup, over makeup, use after a workout, as a pillow spray, and even shade with friends during our work shift! would highly recommend to anyone on a budget! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Im obsessed with this stuff! Has literally the best smell ever. It says Lavender (which Im not a huge fan of) but it doesnt really smell like lavender to me. Its sooo good. Doesnt leave your face with a stick reside or anything. The spray has a nice mist. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this fine mist on this product, gentle on skin, nice scent and perfect for use during skincare routine or makeup application. I use it during both! Only gave it 4 stars because the brand is not cruelty free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This spray smells amazing and feels very refreshing on the skin. 4 stars for that. It was comparable to other face mists on the market but does not offer much else. I did not see much difference in my skin but it was still a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I found this most to be very thick, yet moisturizing. I could see how this would work for some people, however I think people would either love or hate it. The fragrance was also quite strong for my sensitive skin! I will be giving this away to someone who may enjoy it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this!!! I honestly did not expect this most to be so good but its amazing. I love to use it in the mornings after I have showered and applied my facial creams and products. Its just a relaxing and calming finishing touch for my skin and a surprisingly great base for makeup! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The lavender scent was so soothing! I sprayed on my face right before bed. The bottle and packaging was very cute. I've used plenty of st Ives facial cleansers before and they haven't disappointed. Now I can mist my face afterwards!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like to spray this on my face after my nightly routine and before I go to bed. I like the lavender smell on my face before I sleep. Its the best after a day of working and I recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Not a fan of the smell. I generally don't like lavender and I don't think this really does much. I use another face mist that works great on my face but I don't think this product is that unique. The price is reasonable and I think it might be worth a try if you need a relaxing mist as a part of your night routine. However, I don't think it's a product that works for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a magical mist that makes sure each spray covers every square inch of your face. The lavender scent isnt overwhelming either, it actually relaxes me and puts me in a fantastic mood! It doesnt take too long to dry. Overall, a face mist worth trying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The face mist smells great and is super refreshing. It brightens up my skin and makes it seem to glow more than usual. It is also super relaxing. Most importantly it is extremely affordable. Would recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this every morning and every night! It smells so nice and it makes my face feel nice and refreshed. I would absolutely get this again and would recommend this to my friends! Looking forward to trying the other scents! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This face mist is so relaxing and crisp once you spray it on your face! Lavender is my favorite scent, and this one is not too overpowering. The packaging is so cute as well. Id def recommend this for a hot summer day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My new favorite face mist! I use it every morning and every time I get out of the shower. It feels soooo nice on the skin and smells amazing. Thank you sooo much, Influenster! Ill definitely be purchasing once this bottle is finished. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First off, I love the packaging this comes in! Super cute color! It was super gentle on my skin and had an AMAZING smell! It was instantly refreshing and calming, I just wanted to keep spraying it on my face! Would highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Once I opened it and sprayed it, it smelled amazing!! Not a strong lavender smell but a nice soft sweet one! And once you feel the most touch your skin you can feel the refreshens! And I love how you can use it before you apply anything on to your face, and than add it as a finishing hydrating spray on-top of your makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have never used a face mist before and this one is fabulous! Super moisturizing for before makeup in the morning or late at night before bed. Does not leave a greasy look and only needs one little spray to cover the whole face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked this face mist! The scent was super relaxing and it was easy to use. The mist was gentle and didnt cause my face to break out at all! It is supposed to moisturize your face, which I didnt necessarily see as true. However if youre in the market for an easy, fast burst of relaxation then this is a great product for you! If youre looking for ila moisturizing product, maybe stick to a lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this product! The fragrance is super calming and reminds me of summer, although I did knock a star off because it almost smells a little fake. Ive noticed it helps my face appear more hydrated as the day wears on. During winter, I need that! Overall, for the price point, I would totally buy this. Thanks, Influenster, for the complimentary product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I normally dont like scented products, especially face mists because I feel like they dont do much. However, I LOVE putting this on before my makeup. The lavender smell is seriously so calming and it doesnt irritate my skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I enjoyed this product! I cannot tell if it is hydrating my skin. It feels like just plain water. My favorite thing about this mist is that is does actually feel relaxing. The lavender smell is pleasant & calming for some reason. I received this complementary from Influenster, I may repurchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product in a Voxbox. I was surprised by how long the scent lasted on the face. If you are sensitive to fragrances I would not recommend. The sprayer is pretty bad. It isnt fine at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the way this smells. I hate lavender but this scent only has a little hint of it. It smells amazing. So relaxing and calming. I love how dewy it made my skin. Used before doing my makeup and my makeup went on just fine! Gave me a more dewy look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love how refreshing this is. I usually spray at night time to lock in my skin care or in the morning to refresh myself and wake up. The scent is a tad bit strong for me but other than that it is a great product! Would definitely purchase again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this product. Lavender is one of my favorite scents to use on my face. This product leave my face feeling hydrated and soft while giving it a nice dewy look. I did receive this product in a voxbox so I didnt pay for it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At first spritz, very overwhelming. The scent says lavender, and all I smelled was coconut (not a huge issue, but def threw me off a bit). When I tried it on my bare face, it left an insanely sticky residue. Not my favorite item, wouldnt try again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The most was nice. It does the job! I spritzed my face before bed and it helped moisturize my face. But the smell was just way too much for me. I love their smell of lavender but the scent is way too overpowering. I dont know if I could use it again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This stuff smells SO GOOD!!! Ive been spraying it on my face after I get all of my makeup on and it makes my makeup set so nicely and brings back some hydration! I feel like Ill definitely be repurchasing this one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the smell of the lavender , not to strong but one thing I wasnt too fond of was after two sprits and 5 mins of sitting on the face , my face became super oily which I have pretty normal skin. It lefts my face pretty oily and I felt like if I put anything on top it was just make my face feel heavy with a lot of product on [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this product before moisturizing and going to bed, but I also use it to set my makeup. Its fairly effective, but I dont think it makes a humongous difference its just a nice skin refresher. It smells nicebut not really like true lavender. It keeps my face dewy. The spray nozzle is amazing at misting! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I LOVE this face mist! It is beyond refreshing, smells so good youll want to eat it, and feels great on your skin- not too heavy or wet. The lavender really puts you in a calm mood and can help you feel better in an instant spritz! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Makes my skin feel so clear and clean! I love to use it in the morning and at night. It easily relaxes me. I was a little skeptical at first but I absolutely love it and would recommend anyone to use it. My skin it dry and oily at times but it still works great no matter what [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is nice! Its a pretty consistent mist spray from the drug store which is lovely. However, the scent is a little overpowering. Since it isnt a real lavender smell (like from essential oils or the flower itself) I get a little worried putting something that smells so strongly on my skin, especially when I have sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This smells so good and is great at moisturizing! It doesnt make my face feel sticky like some other face mists and is far more affordable than the super trendy ones. I will definitely buy this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This face mist is so refreshing! I love to use one of my lavender scented face wipes, and then spray my face with this at night before I go to bed and i always feel so fresh and relaxed and ready for bed! I also love to use it after i do my makeup to lock my look into place! This spray is phenomenal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The face mist isnt awful. Its a nice little refresher throughout the day when Im not wearing makeup but this is NOT to be used after makeup unless youre extremely dry - caused breakup and a little shininess and Im not typically oily either. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this product! It smells so good that I literally want to bathe myself in it! I love the smell of lavender, so I was really excited to try it out! I use it as a primer face mist before makeup, and it gives my skin a beautiful, natural glow even without makeup on! It feels super hydrating and is not sticky at all which I love! It also works great as a boost to my skin throughout the day if my makeup is looking a little dry! Definitely will be purchasing in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a really nice face mist! I love the scent, and its not too strong. It definitely feels moisturizing too and not sticky. Another thing I like is the spray stream itself, its a nice even layer, not blotches all over your face! And the full size bottle is huge! Its gonna last me months. I would buy this and try the other scents too! I took a star away because it tastes icky when it gets on your lips. Not a deal breaker though! I received this product free from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all, I love the packaging of this product. Perfect size for a purse as well, as it suggests spritzing throughout the day. The scent is a little strong but it is pleasant. I did not notice a big difference on the hydration or glow of my skin however. I would still recommend this product as a final step of a skincare routine or a makeup setting spray. I received this product for free in exchange for my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I personally really love this product! It smells amazingggg... im so addicted! & its really refreshing, I always refresh my face with this before and after i apply makeup for a smooth-hydrated look.

I would recommend to other people though- it make my face soft and refreshed after I used it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am loving this mist! Its smells amazing and feels very refreshing. The lavender scent is a little too strong for me but I still like it.

I use it everyday before and after i wash my face and throughout the day for stress and refreshing. I highly recommend!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The smell of lavender is definitely relaxing, so Id recommend it to anyone who needs something to help relieve tension in the moment. Although its a great product, I probably wouldnt use again because it has a strong lavender smell, which isnt my favorite. However,I do like to use it before getting in bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Really a great mist. I put it on before and after my makeup. It makes my face feel so hydrated without a heavy moisturizer. The lavender has a light sweet smell to it that makes you feel instantly relaxed. Im a fan! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This spray smells so good! I can instantly feel the hydration, and sense of calmness after use. The only thing that I have bad to say is that when you do spray it can get on your lips, and it doesn't taste very good if you were to lick them afterwards. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product so much. The scent is wonderful and soothing and the bottle sprays a really effective and satisfying mist. Very gentle and you only need a squirt or two. I like to use it on a bare face before moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

The most smells so amazing, and it leaves my skin feeling so hydrated, and be sure to rub your lips together after! Bye bye chapped lips. In love. 10/10 must have. I received this in my Voxbox, but that does not influence my opinion. I will be buying this when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this facial spray through Influenster. To be honest, I wasnt expecting much from this product because St. Ives is a lower end brand. The spray did not smell like lavender at all ... it had a weird smell but I actually kind of liked it in a way. I havent used it long enough to see results but it does make my skin feel refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"So far so good! It has a beautiful scent, I love lavender so I'm glad that I received this one. It's the calming scent so I'll definitely be adding it to my daily night time routine. I don't necessarily feel more hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Ive been in love with St. Ives products all throughout high school and still use it in college. Love the formula and feeling it gives to my skin, great on my skin and it smells super relaxing ! Still using and will stock up on later! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the smell of this a lot. It was very relaxing (as it says in the name). I felt like it helped with adding extra hydration to the skin which is what I look for in a facial mist. I dont love how it sprays out. The other ones Ive tried come out in a gentle mist, this one feels a bit aggressive in that its a more direct spray."
I feel so relaxed when I spray this on my face and I feel like it really calms your skin down ive been using this for a week and it just feels super good. The spritzer is a little bit too harsh but I dont mind personally. I make sure that its not super close to my face.
"This mist is so amazing ! It smells super good and leaves my face hydrated, and feeling smooth. I would buy it whenever i am done with this one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
