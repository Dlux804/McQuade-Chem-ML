"I love this skin care product, because my dry and slightly aging skin just drinks it in. My husband says it gives me a pretty glow! However, I rarely buy it because of the retail price. On Jet.com, I was able to buy 2 bottles for about $20 less than the cost of one through Clarins or any dept store. I see the price is higher today than when I bought, but it still is priced quite well."
"Clarins has the best skincare. This serum feels great going on, absorbs well, and leaves my skin feeling super hydrated without feeling oily. I've also noticed a more even tone and texture in my skin. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Thank you for offering a product I've been using for years at a great price.
Love serums and the content of this Clarins serum is wonderful. My skin soaks it in immediately.
"great product, make my skin more calm and health"
This is a very good serum. It helps with my dark spots and wrinkles and fine lines. I saw the results in 2 weeks. I have been using it for over a year now. Smell great and feel great on my face.
"Even though the package of this Clarins serum is broken, the low price still makes me satisfied with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did not see a noticeable difference with using this serum. The packaging is nice and i like the fact that this has two pump options to choose from you can select the right amount for your face.
The bar code on the outer box indicating manufacturer date is January 2017 is different from that on the serum bottle indicating manufacturer date is May 2015.
Too fragrant. Irritating to skin bc of all the perfume. waste of money. Item went straight to the trash since it wasn't returnable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great moisture and helps diminish lines.
"Didn't help that much for my skin, too oily [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Really great price. Love this product really makes your face feel smooth and soft
"yes, girls, it really works! my face is so smooth, skin is soft and I look younger than 3-4 years ago. I use it for neck too, and I can see the result on it. Thank you, Clarins, for this product!"
Great serum for dry skin.
