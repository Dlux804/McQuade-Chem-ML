"Usually I cant tell a huge difference within the first few days of using an eye cream, however with Kiss Red E I definitely noticed my under eye area getting brighter! I've always dealt with dark circles but after months of using this, it seems like they are almost gone. I like to use this twice a day andit goes on nice and evenly. It takes a little bit of rubbing in for the cream to fully disappear but I like that because it makes me rub the product in more. Totally worth the money, I bought this in January and I still have a lot of cream left!"
"This cream is AWESOME. I like to use it in the spring before I get really tan in the summer. I swear that since it lightens my skin my tan is smoother and seems to last longer. It's light to put on, I can't feel it afterwards. It also smells really nice. Overall.... I'm happy that it's sitting on my counter for sure!"
This cream goes on so smooth! It doesn't sting like some Hyaluronic Acid creams. I've noticed my red spots lightening some and my skin feels so soft.
"I love the creamy texture that moisturizes without being greasy. It doesn't have a strong smell either, which is a plus for me. I would definitely recommend it."
"What I like about this product is it keeps my skin soft and brightened! For best results, I highly suggest to use it twice a day for a week. To add, it has amazing ingredients, being organic and vegan, since it doesn't contain any chemicals that can harm the skin in the long run."
Surprisingly effective!!! First time buying this cream and saw results after two weeks. Will absolutely continue usage.
I have terrible hyperpigmentation/melasma and this really seems to work on those areas. I will purchase again.
"I read the reviews and went on buying this cream! Doenst do anything at all, i have used it 5 full weeks first before adding a review! It have a odd smell not like norma facial cream and it didnt help brighten my face or under eye part or anything so far! Just while applying you do look a tone lighter thats it a waste of money for me"
"This was totally disappointing. I got itchy face and redness with this creme. I am still battling with the effects as of now and just looking for something good to relieve my face of the painful itching. It did absolutely nothing good on my skin. If I could a zero rating, I would. Total waste."
Used this more than 6 months....endured the stinky smell hoping for good results. Did not have any changes. Such a waste of money!!
"I loved the ingredients and the fact that it actually works! I hate using chemicals and this is whole some and all natural, organic. It's amazing, it does take some time to start to notice a difference but you'll soon see wrinkles start to fade, and pores shrink, it's just overall amazing."
Anti aging whitening creme is very creamy. I love how the cream soften and leaves my skin moist. it doesnt work very fast but after using twice a day for a week I am beginning to see my skin brighten. I use the cream along with my glutathione pills and vitamin C with sunscreem and the results are amazing. I would recommend this product to friends.
What I like about this product is it keeps my skin soft and brightened.
This cream was absolutely great. It went on very smoothly and wasn't greesy like some. It works very well. I wouldn't definitely recommend this to family and friends!
"I love the fact that this is an organic product that gently fades spots. I have been using it for over 2 weeks and can really see a difference. So can my husband. I take a shower is the evening and put a thin layer on my arms and legs. I have just started using the serum on darker, more obvious spots. Love both products!"
"I have seen astonishing results with this anti-aging neck cream! I also use it as a moisturizing cream on my face.Excellent product, great price"
Love this lightening creaming! Smells wonderful and I've already noticed results. I get self conscious about some of my uneven skin tone and am excited to see more results!
"Thick and creamy, incredibly hydrating. I apply it every evening and already notice my skin tone evening out after just a week. Scentless. Will be getting again."
"Love this product, lightens dark spots, moisturizes and doesnt have a bad smell. I bought another one and will keep using in the future. Highly satisfied and recommend this product."
Very Effective anti aging cr√®me. Love this product.
"It was light and smooth. It is organic, which causes me no guilt applying it."
Love the product it make my skin feel so smooth and soft. Highly recommended!
This cream is really good for our skin. I have been using it for days and I have seen results.
