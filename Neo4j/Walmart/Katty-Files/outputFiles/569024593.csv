"I have been using this product for a few weeks now and it's definitely staying in my skincare routine! The serum is literally so light and yet it is super moisturizing; this made it perfect to wear under makeup and in the summer. The serum gives you soft skin but it doesn't make you look oily, so its great for all skin types. I would definitely recommend using it for plane rides to give your skin some extra moisture :)"
"I absolutely LOVE this product!!! I started noticing a difference within the first week. I feel so confident with how my skin looks and feels after using it in the morning after I wash my face and moisturize, and then again at night before I go to bed. Great product for what it's worth!"
"Wow, this serum is youth in a bottle!! I have used a lot of different brands of hyaluronic acid, but this particular product was more effective. This is a water-based serum that has the consistency of egg whites, and after using it for a few weeks my skin felt softer, more supple, and the elasticity increased dramatically. My skin feels more plump and hydrated, and I feel like it's taken a few years off of me already. I can't wait to see the results in 6 months!!"
I have been giving this little a guy a try for a while now. I really didn't think it would do much until I notice the firmness it gives my face leaves my skin more hydrated!! I can really see the difference with out this in my morning routines and since then I have used it everyday for my morning routine.
"This is a MUST HAVE!! This winter has had my skin more dry than I ever remember- I have never had to put on chapstick this often EVER and the same goes for my face. My foundation has been looking like it's going to disintegrate into the wind! I found this super life saver (and face saver) product that not only puts the life, but INTENSE moisture back in my skin, INSTANTLY. This product has seriously saved my poor face and I'm DEFINITELY keeping this in stock year round. Love love love!"
This serum is amazing! I apply it every morning and night. It leaves my skin feeling so hydrated and soft. I barely put on makeup anymore! This is a must have product. I can't wait to try more from their line.
Pure Hyalurnoic Acid is so important if you want to keep your skin looking young and refreshed. I've been using this product for about a month now and I can see a difference in the fine lines and wrinkles on my face.
"This product is really good, I arrived in perfect condition. the packaging is very easy to use. I've been using this product for weeks and I feel the difference in my skin!"
This serum is very light and applies easily. It is best to use on damp skin. It left me with an amazing finish and soft skin. I even noticed and others noticed my skin looked clearer.
"This was an amazing moisturizer and quickly became my go-to for a quick yet super effective pick-me-up when my skin seemed to lack luster. The only thing I noticed that I didn't like was there would be a weird residue if I put on makeup after using, so I do try to avoid applying if I plan on putting makeup on. Using it at night works just as well and doesn't leave the residue."
The best serum out there! Really good proce! It is a really good product with light texture! The first time that I used I felt my skin so much better. You have to try it.
Love the this formula you cant beat the price. I am always on the hunt for hi end and drugstore skin care products. This one will Def be added to my vanity my skin felt good and plumped after a month totally worth trying it for the price.
Hi there so wanted to start off by say my skin has never looked this good this stuff is a miracle worker I obsessed with it I stop use normal moisturizer This is the only think I i use it the best and results Are all most immediate
I've been using this product after cleansing for about 6 weeks now. My skin LOVES it. Especially in this dry cold weather. I apply to a damp face and let it soak in completely. I apply my normal moisturizer afterwards. I wake up with the smoothest skin! Will definitely purchase again
I been using Yeouth for some time now and I decided to get the pure Hyaluronic Acid and this is amazing it has help me so much and the price is very affordable as well is not expensive at all for what it does to your face I'm in love with this product I really recommend it!!! ❤️
"Pure Hyaluronic Acid is now a part of my Daily Skincare Routine. I was reading online about how this serum moisturizes your skin while leaving it hydrated and gives that glow you need! I thought to give it a try too and I absolutely love it. Application- after applying toner, I use this and then I apply the moisturizer! I have been using this for 2 weeks now and clearly in love with its results."
"LOVE this product! This hyaluronic acid serum is now an essential part of my skincare routine. A little bit goes a long way, it absorbs quickly, and the price point is amazing. While living in NY where the winter months a brutal, this saved my skin from getting dry and cracked like it normally would. I even put it on my lips before i apply a liquid lipstick to help smooth out lines and hydrate which makes it look so much better. Definitely recommend"
I love this product! I've been applying it to my face twice a day for the past week and I think that it works great. My skin is noticeably smooth after application. The serum is also lightweight and quickly absorbs into the skin. A little product goes a long way and it's a great price. I definitely recommend it!
"Loved the packaging, nice glass bottle and easy to use! Soaked into my skin nicely. Iv now added this to my nightly skin care routine!"
"This product has changed my life honestly! I feel so much more comfortable in the skin I'm in now! It has made my skin super hydrated, soft, smooth, and now I actually GLOW! I recommend this product to everyone no matter what age or skin type!"
"I love how refreshed this makes my skin feel! I'm not huge on overusing products on my skin but I'll continue using this for sure! No scent, just pure hydration for my face!"
Loved it! It really helped lock moisture in and has become a staple part of my routines.
"Love this! I have seen a noticeable difference in my 56 yr. old skin. I only use in the morning. I am sure there are higher priced products out there, but for me this gives me great results at a 10th of the price of other advertised products."
"every time I applied it on my face I instantly feel like I applied a thin face mask on my face but it dries out quickly, and it's not an oily serum like the other products so it firms the skin right away which gives you a good start up for your skin care routine. I compared it with another Hyaluronic serum I purchased but it doesn't give that instant refreshing hydration and firm as this serum does."
"I've been using the Hyaluronic Acid Serum for several months and I've definitely seen the difference in my skin. I have combination skin, but the dry spots are really dry. Since adding this serum to my skin routine, I've noticed the dryness is gone, my skin is soft and supple. I love it!"
"Let start with this, you totally get your money's worth because a little goes a long way. I started with the cream and now the serum. Serum by day and cream by night. Yeouthâs Hyaluronic Acid products are a middle-aged moms dream for a simple and effective skin care regimen. My skin feels much more moisturized and my skin discoloration isnât as obvious. Thanks Yeouth for another awesome product!!"
"I've been using this for a few months now and I'm loving it! I have really oily skin, but this winter I've had a few dry patches. I had a hard time figuring out how to keep my skin moisturized without it getting too oily. Well, I've been applying this on clean damp skin and letting it completely dry and then applying moisturizer after and it has worked so great! It keeps my skin hydrated all day and it also has helped my skin not get so oily through out my day!"
"I've been looking for awhile for a product that would help my skin feel refreshed and new. Seriously, this serum works wonders! It took a little bit to get this into my routine and make it a habit, but once I was consistently using it I really saw the difference. My skin tightened and my pores became smaller to wear I didn't have to wear as much makeup. I definitely recommend this product!"
"I absolutely love this stuff. I add this into my daily routine to help keep my skin hydrated, especially this past winter. I was so happy with the results since most other serums are outrageously expensive. Glad I was able to find something so great in my price range that actually works. HIGHLY recommend!!!!"
"I love how simple and straightforward this formula is, while being affordable. This product was gifted to me by Yeouth, but I was able to test this out for a week during the dryest snow conditions in Seattle currently and I enjoyed it. I used this AM/PM. I have oily dehydrated skin so this product helped to hydrate my skin so much! I love that it's only two ingredients, although I wish there was more humectants or benefits to this product added!"
This was my first time using HA and I must say I am in love. I now feel comfortable walking out the door without any makeup on. Keeps me moisturized!
I absolutely loved this product! The application was smooth and I loved the way it made my skin feel afterwards. This product is definitely recommendable and perfect for anti aging.
This serum is super light but super moisturizing! Love using it in the morning after I wash my face and before my moisturizer. My skin stays moisturized all day!
Iâve struggled with dry skin since I moved to Utah a year ago. I decided to try this one out and now my skin canât live without it. The ammount of moisture it gives me without making to greasy is amazing!! 10/10 would reccoment this product
"I love how hydrated it makes my skin feel, especially living in Florida! It also makes my skin so soft and smooth, it's a staple in the morning before makeup and night before bed!"
"Best hyaluronic acid I have bought. It's not heavy at all, it dissolves quickly and you see results quickly as well. I'm loving this brand, can't wait to try other products!"
I loved using this serum. My skin felt soft and completely moisturized just after a few uses. I'm so glad I added this to my skincare routine because it also helps to reduce wrinkles and fine lines. A win-win in my book!
I love this stuff!! I'm always a little skeptical to try new face products but this one was a fav just days after trying! My skin feels hydrated and fuller!
Loved this product! Makes my skin look and feel very moisturized. It makes sure any moisturizing products I add actually sink into my skin. My skin literally glows when I use this product!
"Love this serum! It adds moisture to my face with out it feeling greasy, weighed down, or heavy. It absorbs quickly and works well right before applying makeup or right before bed."
My skin's never been so hydrated and my makeup looks really fresh and glowing. I have dehydrated skin and my makeup is always patchy at my dry area. I don't have this problem after using this serum.
"As I have gotten older, my skin has become very dry. I try and use products that add moisture to my skin. I came across YEOUTH Pure Hyaluronic Acid a few weeks ago. I absolutely love it! It has helped to add moisture to my skin, giving it a more plumping effect to those little places I have crevices, better known as fine line! My skin is also very sensitive and I have found that the serum hasnât irritated my skin as some of the other products I have used in the past. Great serum and a great price too!"
Love how well this suits my skin the hyloronic acid allows my beard area to stay moistureized after shaving. This serum pairs well with any product I have tried it out for about 3 weeks now and I have switched out my cleansers and toners and I have to say this is a gem and it's a stand out product
The Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum saved my skin! No more dry flakes and my skin is glowing more than before! I feel confident wearing no makeup and going out now since my skin is no longer struggling. This is definitely going to be a repurchase for me again and again.
"I have been using this product for the past couple days and I can honestly say it works so well!! Almost immediately upon applying to my skin after I cleanse my face, I can feel it tightening my face! For this type of product, the price is incredible. You get so much product it will last you forever! One pump of the serum goes a long way. I have also noticed that the lines I have previously had on my forehead are becoming less noticeable after using this product! Definitely recommend trying this out!"
I've been loving this product since I got it!! My skin has been super dry and changing since I had a baby. After even a few days I could see a difference in the texture of my skin. It's so much more smooth and hydrated! Even my husband started using it! We've been loving it and the price point is amazing for such an incredibke product without all the chemicals!! Def recommend!
"I was really excited to try out this product. I have been using it for a few weeks. So far... Visibly, I haven't noticed anything yet. But my skin has seriously never been softer. I am impressed with it so far and am excited to see some noticeable differences in how it looks as well!"
"I just used this tonight for the first time and I'm really liking how my skin feels. I'm always nervous to try new skincare products because my skin gets RANDOMLY irritated, so it's better not gamble, but this stuff. this stuff is magic. I can't wait to see how fantastic I look because I'm already noticing a big difference between how my skin felt without it and how it feels now. HIGHLY recommend giving ntgis a shot!"

"This product has been added to my skin care routine, I am loving my results. After one month of use I had plumper skin and smoothed out fine lines! Love this product!"
I have had this product for more than a month and use it daily to see if it will help with my texture and large pores. I must say it did an amazing job. I will recommend using it consistently to ensure proper results. 5 stars for sure.
"I really enjoy using this product every evening! I always wash my face with a cleansing foam and water, then apply this stuff! My skin feels to fresh afterwards. I definitely will be buying in the future!"
"I loved this stuff!! I put it on right after getting out of the shower, then let my face air dry after I apply it. It soaks in and leaves my skin feeling super soft."
"I love how fast it dried! After testing this for a week my skin became noticeably softer, and more refined. I used it before bed after my shower, and in the morning before I started my daily makeup routine."
I love that my skin soaks this stuff right out. However I haven't noticed a significant difference in appears besides the fact that I no get dry patches around my nose.
This serum is amazing! After just one week of use my skin is so much more hydrated and plump! I love it and most deffenitly recommend this to anyone who suffers with dry skin!

I've only been using it for a week and a half but there is absolutely a difference in my skin's appearance
My skin felt more hydrated after one use. I am so excited to try other products from the line!
This product kept my skin looking clear and hydrated in cold climates.
I loved this product. It was moisturizing without clogging my pores.
Been using this for two years now & find it has enhanced my skin very much. It is important that your face is damp before applying the serum.
