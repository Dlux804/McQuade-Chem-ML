"I use this product years ago after breastfeeding, and the change in my Brest was notable. After a lot of years I look for the produc in every store, but they don't haves any more."
I really love this product. The skin on my breast is more elastic and healthy
"OK, so it may be a little to late for me to use this on my BUST, so I decided to use it on my face, and why not if it can be used on an area as delicate as your BOOBs then why not? Well I was amazed at moisturized Matte, firm finish that it gave my skin and it also holds my make up even longer. so yeah it works well as a PRIMER. I may be on to something here and its cheap! Rcoppage"
After I had my daughter I lost quite a bit of volume in my breast and they were just looking tired. So I after having great success with the other Palmers creams for pregnancy I decided to give this one a try. In about a month and a half I've seen a 60% improvement! They have bounce and life again! I am so pleased with this cream. It works well as a face cream as well! I'm sure i'll buy this one for life!
"I absolutely love this product. I layer it underneath Palmers moisturizer for my face. It's feels great, absorbs well & makes my skin looks a little firmer."
I also us this product for tightening under the chin.
I love using this as a facial skin firming gel under my moisturizers. Excellent product
"Another reviewer had said that this cream helped firm up her neck, so I thought I'd give it a try. I've been using it for 6 weeks on my neck and I do see an improvement. It's not magic, but it's better than it was. I'm not sure if it's something in the cream, or just that I'm rubbing in a rich cream twice a day, but in either case, I'm happy with the results."
"This is a great moisturizer. Not real sure if it firmed much, possibly with more time there will be more difference."
"Been using Palmers bust cream for 1 month now and I can see a big difference, my moobs are looking more firmer like female breasts, great results, really pleased, finally getting firming fuller feminine breasts, great product,"
"This cream is one of the few effective, well-priced breast creams on the market here in the U.S. Unfortunately, I am no longer using it because I found the smell so sweet and overwhelming. Please please please, consider bringing out another version with a lighter scent ('m thinking like what you did bringing out the rosehip fragrance version of a skin therapy oil). I'm sure there are many women who, like me, would start buying Palmer's again."
I just started losing weight and wanted a skin treatment to help rejuvenate my skin and so far it seems to be doing it little by little.
