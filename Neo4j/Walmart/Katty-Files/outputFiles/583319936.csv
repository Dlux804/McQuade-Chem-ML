"It's worked really well for me. I use it twice a week because my face is not used to chemicals on it and is quite sensitive. Initially when I put it burns a little and the pad is a bit rough on the skin. But the burning goes away after a few seconds. I have only used this product four times and it's already lightened my dark spots and it makes my skin soo soft to the touch! Love this product, will buy again! Just make sure to use sunscreen after the product so your skin doesn't burn as it makes it quite sensitive to the sun after use."
This really dries up acne really fast. It burns a bit. I haven't seen any re-texture of the skin or fading of hyperpigmentation as of yet. It's only been a week. Plenty of product in the jar is a plus.
