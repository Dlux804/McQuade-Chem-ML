"This was recommended by a dermatology. Great consistency, good coverage. I have melasma and use daily."
"This is a product I have been using for 2 years and I have sensitive skin. It is light non-greasy. Very light clean sent but not in the way of a perfume. Buying from this vendor helped me save money as well and the shipping is fast. Overall, a very good experience and will by again from vendor. Thank you!"
I've been using this for a few years now. It's a great product love the way it feels on your skin and that it has Spf 50. It smells great too!
I love all the creams from this company. They smell good and make your skin look great
Your skin feels moisturized not grease and won't clog pores I have acne prone skin but this works great for me I relly recomend it
"Fantastic product with non-comedogenic, non pore-clogging ingredients - highly recommended by my daughter's gifted and well known facialist!"
I love this stuff. I have been using it for years. Makes my face so soft. Walmart has a fabulous price.
Love this product and have been using it for years. it's not greasy and last all day.
"I don't care for the smell but it does go away quickly. When you apply the moisturizer, it has a white cast, but it goes away as it absorbs into your skin. This is helpful since I have melanin in my skin. It's not very moisturizing either but it is not to thick that you can't use another moisturizer with it."
"Smells and feels great! I apply daily under my makeup. But use sparingly, too much causes my pores to get clogged."
Great product..have used for years. Can't beat this price!!
