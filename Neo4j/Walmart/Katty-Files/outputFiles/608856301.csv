I have always used this as it also has a sunscreen in it. Just love it so would love to try their whips also someday. I got 2 of these so I could give one to my husband. He has had dry flaky skin on his forehead lately. I put this on his face and his problem has completely stopped. No more dry flaky forehead. Wow works on me and women both !
"Great for my skin and I love the fact it has sunscreen in it. I use it on my face, neck arms and hands after my shower using Oil of Olay body wash. It is not greasy and absorbs great."
My husband and I have used this for years. It doesn't cause breakouts and offers the added benefit of sunscreen. This is a great product.
"I love this facial moisturizer. Not too heavy or thick, but thick enough. I also love that there is some sun protection in this."
Great price with spf 15 for 2
It beats the expensive brands
"I have used Oil of Olay,for over 35 years.It is the only product I use other than soap."
I love it.
"Been using for years, My Mom also used it."
"The moisturizer is one of the few which has zinc in it, which I was specifically looking for. It rubs in easily and isn't greasy feeling or looking. Shipment was about a week later than they promised."
Not the Product had used previously! Cannot use the two bottles I purchased! Description should have specified formula had changed!
I am very happy with this moisturizer. It feels light on my skin and doesn't feel oily.
I use this on the face instead of an aftershave. Works
nice.
Great for sensitive skin.
Could not have worked out better.
I use this product every day morning and night. Love the way it makes my skin feel.
Really like this brand. Sensitive skin version is just what I need during the winter!
I've used this for years. I love it
I have used Olay since I was a teen and now I'm in my 50s. It's not greasy. I love it.
"I love the texture of this daily moisturizer. I love that it has sunscreen, also. And! I believe that it keeps my face looking younger!"
"I've used this moisturizer for several years. A couple years ago, my husband started using it, too. We both like it very much as it absorbs quickly and does not leave a sticky residue on your skin. It's also modestly priced - as skin care products go - and doesn't break the bank to purchase it."
Been using for years. People don't believe me when I tell them my age!!
Olay moisturizer is my only choice for my face for fifty plus years and counting.
"I've used this for years, wouldn't use anything else!"
Great value.
Used this product for many years. Good value for price
"I have a very sensitive skin which I can't really trust or try any product on me , but I give this Olay a try and I'm very happy with it . I love this product!!!"
"I LOVE the Original formula (pink swirl) Olay and Sam's had sold this dual pack for years! I have been buying this moisturizer since I was 19 years old, so for the last 23 years. All of a sudden Sam's Club only sells the complete formula which breaks my extremely sensitive skin out due to to the SPF:-( I really wish they would continue to carry the original beauty fluid as it is an excellent moisturizer and a much better bargain for me. It is the only facial moisturizer I use."
I BOUGHT ABOUT THREE WEEKS AGO AND AM HAPPY ABOUT THE PRODUCT AND THE PRICE
I have used Oil Of Olay lotion for more than 30 years. It's a great
moisturizer and has sunscreen in it.
"I started using this product about 40 years ago and after trying a few other moisturizers now & again, I always govack to it."
"I have been using Oil of Olay for years and so did my Mom, I think it is really helping my skin stay healthier. I hope to use it for years to come."
The convenience of ordering online makes shipping so easy. I love the oil of Olay and so glad Sam's has large 2 packs.
Took on vaca .Used as sunscreen everyday.Never got burned. Great for sensitive skin .Doesn't bother your eyes.
we use this every day and t's one of the best moisturizer for sensitive skin for the price. Thank you Olay!!
I use Oil Of Olay on my face and neck and love the feel of my skin.
I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR MANY YEARS. MUCH ESIER AND CHEAPER TO BUY AT SAM'S CLUB
I only purchase this at Sams. Best price and service
Awesome product. I have used it for six years.
Have used this product for many years. It was a good price at sams
"I love Olay products, and was thankful to get them at such a good price!"
Love it!
"I have been using this product for decades and I love it. Every time I stray to try some other, generally more expensive, product, I end up coming right back. Effective sunscreen and the moisturizer is non-greasy and absoreasily into my skin."
"I found the ""new old"" product. Yippee! The box has the familiar yellow, white and black graphics with a green band at the bottom that says light, non-greasy lotion--FRAGRANCE FREE; and the same green color oval on the top left of the package that says ""Classic Gentle Formula"". Many thanks P&G--a belated but still appreciated return of my beloved zinc oxide formula!"
My skin is super dry & this lotion is all that helps with it!!
This is the only moisturizer I can use. It doesn't cause my skin to burn or get red. I have never broken out from this product. I have tried some of the most expensive products and find this to be the gentlest and most effective.
I really like this moisturizer for its formula and the way it makes my skin feel. I appreciate that zinc oxide is used for its sunscreen ingredients and that it's fragrance-free. I also like how it's quite moisturizing and prefer to use it during the colder months.
I have been using Olay products for over twenty years. When the sensitive with sunscreen became available I decided to try it. I love the fact that it is unscented and protects the skin from harmful rays. I am fifty seven years old and have been mistaken for forty many times. I think Olay products are the reason people are surprised at my age. Thank you Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The oil of Olay with 3% zn Oxide and NO orher chemical suncreens is great! It is the only sunscreen I use and as a readhead it is VERY effective. I can not use othe sunscreen chemicals, so really depend on the Zm oxide ONLY formulation with the nano particle size so it's not white on the scin Because I use it, I know the sun protection it provides is much higher that the SPF 16 tested- reality vs a test result! Please leep it in your line!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this sunscreen on my hands and arms daily. It has adequate UV protection and it keeps my skin from drying out. It I have used it for years due to its effectiveness and its affordability for daily use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for the last 25+ years. If it had the sunscreen in it when I started, I'm not sure, but I can say with certainty that I love this moisturizer, and it does not cause my skin to break out like other products I have tried. I now pair it with another OLAY ""Regenerist"" product, but there is hardly ever a day that I do not apply this SPF 15 sensitive product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was 14 years of age when my grandmother who was dutch, gave me a bottle of Olay daily and said she uses this only. With the cold weather in Holland that's all she used, and since then, for 35 plus years that's all I have ever used. My skin is fine, no great. That should tell you what an excellent product this is. Thanks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this product daily. It provides great moisturizing effect and one gets the SPF protection. This protection comes in handy as many of us forget to use SPF on overcast days, even though we need sun protection on those days too. The face and neck are always exposed! I am excited to see there is now an SPF 30. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this reasonably priced moisturizer for years, and I'm going to be 69 yrs. this September 2015, and friends & family remark how beautiful my skin looks. And they are astonished when I tell them I use Olay and the price. I've tried other well know expensive brands and always to back to Olay products since they do the same job and a lower price. Thanks to you Olay I received many compliments of my facial skin and neck line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Olay Complete for Sensitive skin with SPF is the only moisture I have used for forty plus years. I have allergies to certain chemicals and fragrances and found this product perfect for me. Since I am a senior my skin seems to need more moisture. I am happy that it has the PFT that protects. I can walk outside knowing I am protected from the sun. Being fragrance free is a added bonus.

"I have been using Oil of Olay for many, many years. My mom has always used it for as long as I can remember. It makes my skin feel so soft and subtle. My husband always compliments me on my beautiful skin which, to me, is the best reason to continue using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is without a doubt the best daily moisturizer. It is not at all greasy and leaves your skin feeling soft. Protects from the sun as you go about your daily activities. It's a staple for me and goes on first thing every morning. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I watched my mom use Oil of Olay products my whole life so no surprise that I would choose this product also. She had beautiful skin! I like this one because I get sunscreen and it's light. Great base for my make-up, too. Thanks for continuing to produce great products for skin care at any age! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Oil of Olay Complete All Day Moisturizer with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15-Sensitive since I was about 17 and I will be 50 this year. I have been told by many people that I don't look my age and what is my secret. I tell them it is Oil of Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Ourdoor seniors like me need light but powerful moisture protection as well as basic sun protection. This product does as advertised, is easy and pleasant to use and I keep an extra container in my golf bag. I'm a walking advertisement and can share my secret with the ladies in our foursome as it's in my bag. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Oil of Olay facial lotion for over 20 years. At age 41, I get compliments on my skin and appearance. The added benefit of spf is truly a bonus. This is a non-greasy, lotion that I make sure to wear every day, under my make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have highly sensitive skin, and allergic to many scents. I was hesitant to try another moisturizer, that would irritate my skin, or the scent to cause an allergic reaction. I have used many Oil of Olay products and have been satisfied. Once again, I am excited to be able to use this product with no reactions or something or problems. Kudos for making products for those of us with sensitive skin and allergies!!! Thank you!!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Complete All Day moisturizer with sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 allows me to feel secure that I am protecting my face from harmful rays of the sun. the smooth feel it gives my face makes me feel like it is being absorbed well. I don't really need the ""sensitive"" kind but use it so as not to add any ingredients to my skin that would make it appear reddened or blotchy, as in an allergic reaction. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for many years. When I was in my early 20""s my mother told my to start using Olay moisture on my face and my face wouldn't get so many lines and wrinkles. I took her advise because she had a lovely skin. Now I am in my 60""s and asked by pother friends what I use on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I am very low maintenance woman & fuss free and on the go. Oil of Olay all day moisturizer does the trick for me it is light & covers well. When I was in college I spent lots of money at the beauty counter. I wish I could have the money back that I spent all I need is Oil of Olay moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Have used this many yrs. Love the non-greasy feel. Use it 2x a day. Morning and evening after my shower and evening. I also use enough for my neck and decollette area. Nice fresh smell and creamy feel. My skin immediately feels nourished and hydrated(not dry). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is my everyday go to. I do not start a day without it. It goes on easy and gives great UV protection so you never have to worry about being outdoors. I have used this lotion everyday since college and although I won't tell you how long ago that was, I am always being told I look younger than my years. Thank you Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this product is great for sensitive skin, and for sunscreen protection, Since i light skin with freckles,, the sunscreen is very important. Since i am getting older, and find my skin needs have changed, do need more moisturizer as well. I would definately reccomend this product to anyone, it is never too early to start protecting and caring for your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the All Day Moisturizers with sunscreen for sensitive skin. I have to watch what I put on my face or I will have a date with the dermatologist! This product helps keep my face moisturized and fends away the wrinkles. It is wonderful that there is sunscreen in the moisturizer to protect from the sun during the day.

"I have used the Oil of Olay for many years, and my daughter has as well. We love the light texture, feel and coverage of the Complete All Day Moisturizer with the built in sunscreen. It is especially good for my daughter's sensitive screen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Olay for many years and I continuously get compliments on my skin...What do you use, you don't seem to age - you have no wrinkles or lines. What more can I say; I am a true believer in the Olay products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"For the past year, I have been using Olay's All Day Moisturizer with sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 - for sensitive skin. What I love about it, is that it is light and covers me without feeling greasy. I love the added sunscreen protection and leave my house always feeling fulling protected. I highly recommend this product for anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this moisturizer since January and I think it's better than those expensive moisturizers I buy. I noticed a difference in my skin, more so than other expensive lines I've tried in the past. I am also using the Regenerist at night and the luminous serum after moisturizing."
I love the Complete All Day Moisturizer with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15– Sensitive! I've been using it for about a year and absolutely rave about it. I have very sensitive skin and can't wear most sunscreens or moisturizers on my face. It takes a special product so that I don't break out in rashes or acne. This does the trick and keeps my skin looking beautiful!
Thank you for returning to the original formula for Sensitive Skin. I think I must have been one of the first ones to call Customer Service last year stating that eyes were stinging with the re-formulated brand. I love the old formula it works well doesn't feel greasy does not have a scent that makes my eyes water. I use it as do both my teenage girls before any foundation is applied. Please keep this formula and think about a better price. The bottle has decreased in size and the price has gone up.
I wore the original formula about twenty years ago and got many compliments on my glowing skin. I am thrilled to see it back! I love the zinc oxide in the formula I can trust as long as it doesn't change again.Sometimes we cannot improve on what is already excellent. Please consider making a night firming formula or something complete for all ages. I think gentle and non irritating is what everyone loves. Thanks again for returning something I love.
"This stuff makes your skin soooo soft and is NOT GREASY at ALL. Use it around your eyes, it helps prevent or reduce thse wrinkles and doesn't burn or make your eyes water if you happen to get a little in your eyes. Use it anywhere to moisten without the greasy feeling, completely absorbes into your skin! Been using it for YEARS!!! SAM'S 2-pack is also the CHEAPEST way to buy it!!!"
My intention was to buy the combination/oily formula but it wasn't available. I figured the sensitive formula couldn't hurt. I bought the renegerist trio but the deep hydrating cream was too moisturizing for me during the day. This a great lightweight moisturizer for combination/oily skin!
"I am so glad I tried this moisturizer w/ SPF! It's just what I was looking for to complete my daily face regimen, it is perfect for my fair, sensitive skin - it's moisturizing enough to wear on it's own (without layering with another moisturizer) - and I love that it has zinc in it. I wear it everyday! Thanks again, Olay!"
"This product is okay. I try to use as little as possible on my face and neck until my face feels moisturized. If i use what I would consider a normal amount, it doesn't soak in well and my face looks greasy. If this happens I just take a towel and wipe the rest off of my face. Good for the UV protection, but as an overall moisturizer it's just okay."
"Classic sensitive formula is back!!! I almost cried when I found it on the shelf....was about ready to give up. I tried store brands with 6% octinoxate 3% zinc oxide and they didn't irritate my skin, but your formula is the best for creamy, non-greasy moisture."
My rating of this product is still 1 star which means Poor (to say nothing of disappointing and unpleasant). But I am very happy to have finally found the reinstated Classic Gentle Formula which deserves 5 stars. Perhaps you will even give the Classic Gentle Formula its own place on this Website.
"I have used this product all of my adult life. It is the best!!! When I used makeup, this was my foundation, now I don't use makeup and this is all I put on my face after I wash it. It is perfect on my skin!!! I recommend it highly!!!"

Feels like pure sunscreen instead of a moisturizer. Did not make my skin feel soft. Couldn't even finish the bottle.
I have been using this for a while now. It's my go to daily moisturizer. Great investment for any age.
"It's amazing for my sensitive skin. Light, non-greasy, absorb quickly, dont break me out or clog my pores, can't really smell the suns cream."
Is it true that this moisturizer does not provide broad spectrum coverage under the new FDA rules?
I have dry skin and this helps my face stay soft all day and does not clog my pores
