"I have been using this product for about 1 year. It has made a huge difference (thank you!!!). I told my sister about it, she bought it and uses it every day and loves the results!"
I have been using the product two times a day as directed and I already see a difference in a few days. Excellent quality and results for a modest price. I am hooked!
My products arrived quickly and so far I am very pleased! My face is softer and more smooth than ever.! I am looking forward to seeing awesome results in the days to come
Love this creamy product. Goes on smooth and makes my skin feel smooth
Really works!!!!! Wasted many years buying Lancôme products .... won't be making that mistake again!
"I have used this product for a number of years. I was so happy when I found it at Sam's Club since the price is considerably less!!! Great product, great buy!!!"
Neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair cream feels very silky and luxurious going on and the results are immediate. It makes skin look and feel smoother right away.
I have been using this product for a week now. I love that it isn't overwhelmed with perfume and dye. So far I have had not problems with my face breaking out as I have sensitive skin to face creams. I do see some improvement in just one week on the fine lines on my face. Would recommend this to anyone!!
I've been using this faithfully for two weeks and I have noticed a difference. My skin feels smoother and my fine lines have softened up too. Even my deeper wrinkles aren't quite as deep. Did not irritate my sensitive skin or make me red and flaky like other retinol products have.
"I know this product works well for other people, but my skin has a bad reaction. My face was very red, dry and inflamed. I suggest using once every other day right from the start rather than 2 x a day every day. The label recommends switching to every other day IF you have a bad reaction—why not do that at the beginning of usage?"
"Received my products about a month ago, but I took me over 2 weeks to start using the Neutrogena products. Why did I wait? I have no valid reason since the Rapid Wrinkle Repair products have lessened my facial lines and wrinkles as well as softening and brightening my face within the first week of use! This/these product/s have improved my skin like no other product that I've tried in the past. Believe me, I've tried many facial products at various prices, never seeong any results. Thank you Neutrogena!"
"I was skeptical before purchasing the Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream as I had issues with retinol products in the past. I have diligently used sunscreen since I was in high school. At 45, I see that it has paid off to protect my skin from the sun. However, I notice that my skin needs help with exfoliation and regeneration in my forties. Please keep this product in stock! I love it!"
Been using Neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair products for 1-2 years now. I absolutely love it! My face looks brighter my skin looks younger and more supple. The price is reseasonable too. I don't feel you need to spend top dollar at the dept store to see results. I will continue to use my new rapid wrinkle repair cream.
"I have used this product for a month now and am so pleased with results. With my sensitive skin, no burning, redness or breakouts. Shout out to Hot and Flashy the YouTube beauty guru for excellent video and recommendations! I couldn't be more pleased."
I used this produce for 2 weeks daily and developed severe dryness in several spots and redness that became sore. I guess this is expected. I stop using it for a week and not only use it once every couple of days. I was disappointed that it was so harsh on my skin.
"I ignored your request for a review several times. Then I read some reviews. to each is own i guess. I don't reccomend the dark spot remover, I purchased the rapid day cream, night cream and dark spot remover....my spots seem darker I will go back to loreal, im sorry."
"I LOVE Neutrogena products. Because I wondered about the difference between , the Rapid Wrinkle Repair (which has taken away almost all of my wrinkles) and the Regenerating Cream, I decided to order the the latter. After a short time, I have noticed that my skin is healthier and more glowing."
I have only had this product for a few weeks. I use it at night and in the morning. It absorbs quickly into the skin. It is not greasy at all. I just received a compliment that my skin was looking wonderful... I believe it is this product. I would purchase this again...
"This is my first time trying this cream. I really like it. Goes on so smooth, with no greasy feeling at all. Don't need to use very much. I feel it's softening my skin & evening out some patchy areas. I'm also using the eye cream & feel they are both doing what they state so far!"
I try many creams as I have skin that is dry and peels constantly (maybe as I am outside in the weather?). This product has helped more than others I have tried but the biggest bonus was a problem spot on my cheek with tough leathery scales is evolving into normal skin. I do have to reapply a few times a day. Great smell! 4 stars now just because 3 weeks is too short of a time to rate a 5.
I have been using this product for about two weeks with the spot corrector. Just as said after about a week I noticed a firmer and more evenly toned skin on my face especially sunspots and around my eyes. One negative fo me is the smell. Its not strong or overly fragrant but since I apply on my face in am and pm I do notice that I don't really care for the smell but its not un-bareable. Overall I am satisfied with the product.
"This is so moisturizing. I don't have wrinkles, but needed a good moisturizing cream because the heat in my apartment was drying out my skin and the winter weather was taking a toll on my face. Saw it on sale and decided to get it. I am glad I did. It makes my face so soft and supple. I have been using it now for two weeks. My skin seems plumper, firmer and has more bounce back. I am very pleased with the results of this cream."
This is my 3rd jar and my skin has never been so good. I get compliments all the time.
Great stuff would recommend to everyone this is my second jar
"I'm sure it's a good product, but I didn't like the smell. I assume it's the retinol in it. I'm taking it back."
Excellent product - Sam's Club unbelievable price savings! Always use this wrinkle cream and Neutrogena products.
It appears to be working quite well. I love the texture and how is not greasy. I've only actually used it a couple of weeks.
"I priced this product in 5 stores and purchasing it at Sam's in the duo pack was a super value., not to mention that the product itself is amazing."
I've had mine for about a month and I really like it. It seems to work to remove wrinkles from around my eyes.
I bought this because my daughter used it and I could see how beautiful her face looked. Young and healthy. But I guess because of my age it's going to take longer. I see a little different but I will still use it.
"I highly recommend! The Retinol cream does not leave your skin in disarray but instead you wake up to a very very soft skin. I have sensitive skin and for the time being use it only at night, absolutely no problem."
Excellent product--it really does noticeably plump and rejunvenate the skin AND keeps it moisturized. I apply it on skin recovery days when I'm not out in the sun and wearing no makeup (about 3x a week). It's a little too thick to wear under makeup.
"I have particularly dry skin, and this product would be very helpful for me. But I can't stand the perfume! I wish it was unscented. I won't be using it."
I've used the product for two weeks and absolutely love it. I have read reviews regarding the scent (I love it) it's very soft and soothing. My skin feels wonderful. I would most certainly buy again.
I haven't had it tat long but since I've been using it I can notice a slight difference. I like the fact that it doesn't feel greasy and it blends right into your skin
I love this product! I will definitely be a return customer. It was highly recommended by a new dermatologist I seen. I seen improvements in my skin within a week. I love how it makes my face feel and my tone has improved so much.
I have been using Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream and love the
texture of the product. Absorbs quickly. I feel it does help with keeping my
fine lines at a minimum.
Wow! I am really surprised. I like this product! I assumed you need to spend a lot of money for a product but I have found this to be incorrect. Works great and cost is affordable.
"I just received my 2nd jar and I really am very happy with it . If I had. Started earlier in my life it would have been great, but it has reduced some of my fine lines. Don't put it off ,it works."
"I have been using the Rapid Wrinkle Cream for about 3 weeks now and am amazed at the results. I have such a natural glow and have had a number of comments. Subtle, but powerful improvement in my skin."
"I have used this product for over a year...I doesn't do a lot for wrinkles on a 75 year old face, but it certainly makes my skin very soft and smooth...And makes the makeup look much better."
Amazing results in just one week of using. I should have done a before and after! So happy I started using the Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream.
"I live in the Desert Southwest, humidity average is 12%. So very very dry. Your skin care products absolutely help battle the dry skin and wrinkles caused by this harsh climate. Thank you for developing the rich moisturizers and body bath products!"
"I just started using this two weeks ago and I already see results! It goes on smoothly and soaks right in! I look forward to un-wrinkling my face, neck and chest!"
I've been using this for about 1 week...only once a day even though it recommends 2 but I can already see a softening of the wrinkles around my mouth and my neck.So far very happy with results!
"I just bought this. And have only used for a few days....will add to my review as I use the product for a while. So far, so good.....a little burn with serum, but not too bad. I am hopeful I will be as pleased as others who have posted reviews"
"All moisture creams are not equal in consistency. I love the feel of this. Too soon to tell if provides results advertised but will continue to use for coming months to give it a chance. So far, so good!"
Cream is moisturizing too! This does not dry my face out at all! I use it with the retinol oil.
I found this cream to be a little too thick for under makeup and it didn't dry very quickly. It makes a great night cream though! (Also there's no sunscreen in it) in comparison to their healthy skin anti wrinkle cream that is light weight spf 20 and works great for all day wear under makeup.
"I had looked at buying at local drug store, but the price stopped me. I purchased 2 for a tad more than 1. Great buy and so far I like the product"
I have been using this cream. It was white except for this purchase which is like ivory. Is this the new color or is there something wrong with them?
I have been using this Neutrogena product for a year. I love it. It works quite well and feels fantastic.
I recently went on vacation and got a little sunburned on my face. I started using the product and it helped my skin return to normal.
I've used everything. I'm
Also allergic to everything. I love the scent and the velvety feel! I have gotten so many compliments on my skin since using this! I also didn't break out which is literally crazy because I have super oily skin. Avoid getting too close to your eyes and I don't use it on my neck. Any remaining I put on the tops of my hands. Worth the price! Just buy it.
One of the best face creams I have bought!! Great cream!! Great value!!
Highly recommend it!!
I am really pleased with this face cream.
"Nothing is going to completely stop aging of my face, but this really does work. I used it before bed every night."
I bought the rapid wrinkle repair. week ago and the crease in my forehead is less noticeable after 3 days of use.
I have only been using it for a week. My skin is soft and glowing but not seeing where its helping my wrinkle lines too much.
"I have been using this product for a couple of months, I am really happy with the results and it smells really good."
"I purchased this product a week or so ago,and I am enjoying it. Feels smooth and makeup goes on smooth."
Rapid Wrinkle Repair has a nice consistency and feels great on my skin. I would recommend this to everyone.
"This is the most fantastic cream for deep wrinkles. I was so upset that it is not available in shops anymore, but luckily I found it on your website."
I tried the rest and Neutrogena is the most reliable product on the market I am 75 years old and I feel so satisfied with my results.
"After using it for 2-3 days, my skin got so dry and red with burning feeling on the cheek. I have to stop using it."
I have been using this product for 1-2 weeks. I could tell the benefits by the 2nd day! And the price is outstanding!
I just started using this and can already see a difference. I'm mainly using this to avoid later in life major wrinkles.
I've used Neutrogena products for a year now and absolutely love them. They have improved my skin and made it much softer
It works amazingly well & results are FAST! I use it in AM & alternate it with Neutrogena Hydro Boost at night. (I've been using that for a while)
"Been using this product for a week now, and I love the texture of my skin: smoother and the very few crow's feet that I had are gone."
I have been using this product for seven days and I haven't seen or feel any changes on my face or neck.
I bought this 3 weeks ago and feel like I'm already seeing small signs of wrinkle diminishments! Im very hopeful.
"My face has never looked better. I love this cream. It has a nice texture, isn't overly fragrant, and feels nice going on and throughout the day."
I am 72 yes old and love the feel on my face
"I have been using for several years,and it has helped prevent wrinkles. Sam's has best price!!"
The results are amazing. You will love the way you look. Great price and quick shipping!
I bought several products. Love them all except the rapid wrinkle serum. It leaves some funky weird white stuff all over. Kinda nasty and impossible to put makeup on over it. Won't buy that again.
I bought the cream under the guise that it would show results “within a week”.
It's been a month and it's actually given me puffiness under the eyes.
I've been using this cream about 3 weeks. I can already see a difference in my skin. My skin looks more radiant and I can definitely see a decrease in fine lines. Will definitely keep using this product!
"I used cream on 12/20/17 till 1/4/18 I have to stop,because the red skin turn to dry dark skin patch and not peel off .i hope it will peel off,and I will have my normal skin back soon."
"I have been using this product for well over a year now and have been very impressed by the change in my skin. I'm 52 years old and while I have some wrinkles they are less visible since I have been using the rapid wrinkle repair. I also use the moisturizers, both day and night. I love the way my skin feels. Thanks Neutrogena."
"At the age of 70, you can well imagine that I have tried a variety of skin products. I recently decided to ""switch out"" my moisturizer and tried Rapid Wrinkle Repair. It has been about three weeks now and I have noticed a definite change in my skin and it's texture. Granted I have genetics on my side ... and modestly I can say, I look fabulous."
I bought this a couple months ago and used as directed. Around the eyes it burned so I stopped using it there. Everywhere else it does absolutely nothing..and after using it every day for more than 2 months I can confidently say it was a waste of money and time...
"I am not happy with this product at all. Immediately my face began to burn, became blotchy, and an flakiness appeared all over my chin. I thought it may be just my face getting used to a new product, but after a month, I am still seeing the same results. My under eyes are completely swollen as well."
I bought this cream two weeeks ago and have used for a week and a half. This product has made under my eyes red and honestly it looks like I'm 10 years older. My husband is horrified with how it has made me look. Do not buy this product. I hope my eyes repair itself but I would never buy this again.
"I bought this just a few days ago. I certainly did not apply it twice a day and am so grateful for that. I actually dread to wash my face when I get up in the mornings and before I go to bed at night. My skin feels like its burning and nothing seems to ease the sensation no matter what kind of moisturizer I apply. I expected well moisturized, soft skin but instead have endured dry, flaky, and red skin."
"I started using this product along with the oil. Been using only 4 days! I don't directly apply right under my eye. But holy cow this is awful, my under eye area is beet red like I have a terrible sun burn. Like others said it made what wrinkles i have 10x worse and more defined. I'm very upset. It's painful and awfully dry and my skin looks terrible. I'm taking back!!!"
"I Purchased the rapid wrinkle repair serum, rapid tone repair moisturizer, and the rapid wrinkle repair regenerating cream. I've used them for two weeks, every other day to allow my skin time to adjust from my previous product that I used for at least 25 years, that being, Estee Lauder‘s perfectionist cream. I felt confident in choosing a Neutrogena product for safety sensitivity and results. But in trying to find a good product a little less expensive I've burned the skin around my eyes instead. Lesson learned !"
"Wrinkles and fine lines, gone. Skin looks vibriant."
Best product ever!Threw out all my other products. Only using all Neutrogena now.
I bought it almost two weeks ago and my wrinkles and pores are almost gone.
I have been using it for 6months
Susan from New Jersey
I have sensitive skin and I like the way this moisturizer softens my skin without irritating it.
Always willing to try new things...happy I tried this one. Will buy it again!
"It's starting to help the wrinkles! I didn't buy it very long ago, but it's starting to work!!"
I just received the product and began using it immediately.
I just received this a few days ago but I Love the feel!!
I've been using other products but this is the one that truly works
I bought this two weeks ago and just started using it.
"I have tried many products, however, this has been the best."
I am very pleased with the way the product has improved my skin. Wrinkles are no longer noticed.
I have been using this for a few weeks and I can actually see a difference!
I've been using this for a month now and my face appears smoother. I use it twice a day and I've seen a nice change in my skin
I just started using this a few weeks ago and love how it exfoliates and brightens my skin. I will keep using it. Thank you!
"I have been using this for a little over a week. I did notice how better my skin feels and looks. This is, for sure, my first go to in the morning, and my last go to, before I go to bed."
"I have been using this product line since it came out. My face is more toned, less hyperpigmentation and a glow to my skin. I've tried just about everything out there. Nuetrogena will always be my go to."
"I haven't used the regenerating cream, but am using the rapid wrinkle repair. I really did have to use Neutrogena exclusively and my skin is definitely better."
"I have sensative mature skin and think this cream works just as well, if not better than than the over priced named brand creams and I have tried them all!"
I have been using this product for about two weeks and am experiencing the same difficulty that other people have commented about. Redness and dry skin under my eyes with some burning as well.
"I have been using this product for about 6 months and am very happy with it. Because I have oily skin I don't want a product that will make me feel more greasy, which this one does NOT. Makes my skin feel smooth and soft."
"I purchased this product from watching a you tube recommendation. I was looking for a 2nd anti aging cream to change up from my regular Cerve renewing night cream. I find the scent of this product to be pleasant, it goes on well. Tried it day & night but changed just to pm since it doesn't work well with my BB cream. Don't find anything great about it. I've had alittle tingling one time. Would I buy it again? Maybe."
Works great. Does not remove deeper wrinkles but less fine ones and tones.
I won't use any products other than neutrogena cuz they work.
"I bought this three days ago. First night was okay. Second night, I woke up and my face was ruined. My eyes look older than before. They are beet red,swollen, raw,and have deep wrinkles. My whole face is swollen and beet red. I had to go to the doctor and get medicine to heel my skin. I'm going back to my old face cream. This product should be taken off the shelves."
"I have used neutrogeona products for years and they are always great. However, I used rapid wrinkle repair with retinol to be harmful. Using this product created more wrinkles and dark lines around my mouth area. The cheek area in my face cheeks are less wrinkles. I do not recommend you ladies using this anti wrinkle cream. I am very sad and tearful."
Just wish the sunscreen was still in it
Love the results
I've been using this product for about 3 weeks. My skin is softer and more radiant.
This just came in the mail. It is my second Jar and I love this product!
"Was looking for a product to help with wrinkles. So far, so good!"
Have been using product for over a year. Very satisfied!
"Only been using for 2weeks, but my face feels great, smoother & brighter"
I like the smell of the cream. I have only used it for 2 weeks and my face feels smothier.
I like the way it goes on so smoothly and makes my skin feel great
Got this product just a week ago and can already see a difference in my wrinkles. Meaningful Beauty seemed to make them worse. I love it.
Have been using this for less than a week and like that it is non irritating. I dislike the fragrance but have heard that a fragrance free version will come out. The jury is out on this but the price point is nice.
"I used this product for about 7-10 days as directed and it was working great until I developed a small red rash on my neck which after a day or two became scaly and dry. Then it started to itch on and off around the area (jawline, chin, upper chest). I immediately discontinued use after the appearance of the rash. After reading that some of the ingredients are toxic and cancer causing, I decided to keep my wrinkles. I do not otherwise have sensitive skin but this product did not work for me..."
"Used as directed and after 3 days face has red blotches, swollen and burns. Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing. Today had to spend a fortune buying a cleanser and moisturizer that doesn't burn, everything I have burned. This product should not be on the"
market!
"I bought this cream for the wrinkles in my forehead i started using it once a day at night I didn't experience any redness,stinging or peeling but by day 10 my face broke out in acne all over my forehead ,cheeks and chin !!! Is this suppose to happen ??!!"
this product is burning around my eyes and around my face where i am using the cream. i will not be using this anymore. I would like a refund. I do not have my receipt. What do i need to do to get a refund?
I am 67 years old and have spent thousands of dollars on expensive skin products over the years. I have always liked Neutrogena products but assumed they weren't as potent as more expensive products. This product has done more to erase wrinkles around my chin and mouth than anything else I had tried. Those were my problem areas. People have commented on how good my skin looks so I will continue to use this product for as long as you make it. Love it love it
"I have only been using the product for THREE days, and already I have a noticeable change in the dreaded wrinkles, particularly the ""marionette"" lines on the sides of my mouth. Three DAYS!~Skin is FIRMER. I have experienced nothing other than a mild tingling sensation, applying twice a day. So far I LOVE it, and am now interested in trying the serum and day/night moisturizers, as well. This product performing far better than the pricier skin care products that I have been using."
"I was a Oil of Olay user since I was 13 years old. Now at 51, their products were not doing it for me anymore. I finally switched to Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair and find it to be one of the best face lotions I have ever used. Loved the way my skin looked within a few weeks. Many compliments about it from people I know."
"Who said too much TV is not good for you? Well let me just say I saw the commercial for Neutrogena with Nicole Kidman in it talking about wrinkles and using this product. I'm 56 years old, using this product just over 3 weeks my face is so smooth, tiny lines are disappearing, my face looks refreshed. I haven't experienced any redness at all around my eyes; only noticeably fading disappearing crows lines that I'm grinning about. Thank you Neutrogena!"
"I love how this has made my skin look. At bedtime I use this over the rapid repair wrinkle serum. Is that okay to do? Or is this like a serum cream? And I don't need the other? Also, can I use a moisturizer over This? Because I haven't been but I love the hydro boost gel! Thanks so much! I jave reviewed a whole line of Neutrogena products on my YouTube channel and a lot of my friends purchased the items I mentioned and couldn't be happier!"
I love the product. It has improved my skin by removing all the dead skin and made my face look younger. You see the transformation take place within two weeks of using the product as directed twice a day. My neck also looks great. I feel like a new me. The cream has a fresh scent and is quickly absorb by the skin. I strongly recommend this product. You get results at an economical value.
"I received this product from Pinch Me to try and I want to say thank you!! I normally use Clinique, so I probably wouldn't have purchased on my own. Rapid Wrinkle Repair® Regenerating Cream has improved the look and feel of my skin so much that I was surprised!! My skin is so soft and even smoother in the short time I have been using. Thank you Neutrogena for a great product and thank you Pinch Me for sending to me to try!! I will be purchasing now!"
I have been using this product about two weeks now. I can really tell a difference on my forehead. I have the horizontal lines (one is deeper than the rest). These lines are not noticed as much. I am looking forward to the continued use and am expecting the results to get better with time. I received this product for free from Pinch Me.
"I've used this item once so cannot comment on its effectiveness, only on the packaging -- the box is 2-1/2 times the height of the product, presumably so you will think the jars is larger than its 1 oz. (also bad for the landfill); it is very difficult to open from the top, and from the bottom, which has glob of glue on it which sticks to everything once you do get it open. I hope the product works."
I really was surprised that the results on fine lines is incredible. Softens skin and reduced the appearance of fine lines around the eyes. I liked using it at night and in the morning under makeup. I received this sample from Pinch Me in exchange for an honest review.
"Ok, it's real early to be posting a review since I've only being using your Rapid Wrinkle Repair Cream for 3 days, but I'm seriously impressed already by the effect it's having on my skin because I can see and feel a difference already. I'm excited by the change! Thanks for putting a big smile on my beautifully moisturized face:-)"
I started using this cream twice a day every day for about a month now my pores are smaller my skin tone is even wrinkles are definitely looking smother overall best product I have used so far have always used Neutrogena skin cleansing products and This cream has made me a complete Neutrogena user. I have sensitive skin and other than a little tingling feeling around the eyes no problems.. Highly recommend it I'm 47 and get compliments on my skin all the time!
I received a sample of this product from PinchMe.
First this product is less creamy than my previous moisturizer. It feels like a combo of serum and moisturizer with a light fragrance. I did have some light flaking Around my eyebrows after a couple uses but it went away by the next day. There was a noticeable difference after the first week. My skin felt smoother tighter and there was minimizing of my lines.
"I am on my second jar and the cream is a nice consistency, absorbs well. BUT, the ""fragrance"" is overpowering and NOT pleasant. It is difficult to use the product because I hate the odor--no way I can even wear in the daytime, am forcing myself to wear it at night--cost too much to waste. The first jar didn't seem so bad. Please, Neutrogena, fix this!"
"I bought this less than a week ago, and have used it twice a day as recommended. Seriously, two different people told have already told me that I'm just glowing - and I'm nearly 70! I think it's really making a difference in my skin, and it feels wonderful on. The only reason I didn't give it a “5” is that it's been such a short time. So far, I'm very happy with it."
I used this product for about 2 days and ended up getting bumps and redness around my mouth and under my eyes with a burning sensation. I do not have allergies at all. I would have loved to see what this had to offer but had to stop due to the reaction my skin had.
"After the second day I experienced a burning sensation and since the jar said that this could be the case, I tried it a third day and the following morning I have a lot of peeling and redness similar to a sun burn. Is this normal should I try to use the cream again."
Received a free sample of this product through PINCHme & love it. The cream goes on your skin with a cooling effect like no others. I feel like it leaves an invisible mask on my face to protect my skin all day & definitely tones & tightens your skin in under two weeks.
"I bought this cream on Sunday and after using as directed, by Tuesday, I had skin burns on my face and the skin peeled off around the under eye area and cheekbones. After 24 hours of non-use, I still experience burning, especially in the under eye area. I do not have allergies to anything nor have I ever had this reaction from using other brand products. I believe this product caused minor skin burning."
"I have been using this cream for about a month now. My skin is less dull, is smoother, and has a glow. I am only using it at night because using it twice a day leaves my skin a little sensitive. I had been using pricey department store creams previous to this cream and I like this one better! You can not beat the value"
I bought this cream because of the retinol. After using it for 3 weeks I have noticed a big difference in my skin. Any wrinkles that I do have are not noticeable and my skin is extremely soft. I also bought the eye cream and the day and night moisturizer. I was quite surprised because I have used expensive products that haven't given the same results. I am extremely happy with Rapid Wrinkle Repair and will continue using it.
"I was using this product twice a day for nearly a month. Then my face started itching, and it was super dry to the touch. It looked like a rash, but the directions said this may happen so I googled Retinol and learned that the exfoliation happens inside out and what I was experiencing was the retinol actually working. So, I kept going and so glad I did! The fine lines around my eyes are gone!!! I look years younger. I still have some redness around my mouth and chin, but the rest of my face is butter soft. Keep with it."
"You have to use it faithfully. It has helped reverse sun damage on my face, dark spots, fine lines and dullness, and fine lines mostly on my forehead and neck, with consistent use for 3 weeks, but if your skin is on the dry side I suggest using another moisturizer with it. I use it at night mostly. Good product for the price."
This product is amazing and I noticed a change almost immediately to the tone and texture of my skin. The fragrance is pretty strong but I hoped it wouldn't bother me. I woke up each morning I used the moisturizer with a bad headache and had to stop the treatment and return the product. I'm hoping a fragrance free version will be developed soon! Please!
"This stuff is great. Ive used the 1% retinol products like Obagi, Paulas Choice and SkinCeuticals, costing more than double this and with less visible results. The ""fragrance"" is not pleasant but who cares! Ive been using twice a day and actually had to let up under my eyes and on my neck because i did get a bit burned so will rest those areas then do them once a day or every other day."
"In the past i have used prescription 4% Retin A made by Neutrogena. I recently purchased the Regenerating Cream since it is a lot less expensive. It doesn't say what percentage of Retin A is in this product. Also, can I use a serum under the Regenerating Cream or another night cream on top of this cream?"
In the beginning my face feel tide and was red and e
Itching some nights I put only Vaseline to combine but I keep using now everything is normal I am finishing my second product and I'll buy definitely to stay with this cream I can feel the difference
"I absolutely LOVE this product, but I couldn't get past the scent. It was too cloying for me and I wish it had a cleaner scent, or no scent at all. It's a shame, my 57 year old skin had never been better when I used it so sadly I won't be purchasing it again. If you ever decide to make a change, I'll be buying it forever."
I love this product that I recieved from PINCH ME!
It is light and not greasy ! Just a small ammount goes a long way and it truly does help diminish fine lines and wrinkles! My skin looks and feels younger ! Thank you Pinch me and Neutrogena !!! It works as well as the expensive products at a fraction of the cost!
"I have been using this product for over a year now and love it. My skin is so sensitive that I can't use anything else. I've tried Lancome, Clinique, Estee-Lauder, and Clinique and they all irate my skin. Neutrogena products don't bother my skin at all. I won't use any other products."
Tengo 1 año usando estas cremas ... Y solo uso las de noche y la verdad a mi me funcionan exelente ... Tengo 40 años y sin mentirles todos dicen que lusco de 25 .. Pero tambien tomo mucha agua en todo el dia y tambien no consumo bebidas alcholicas porque eso produce muchas arrugas.. Usenlas todos los dias y veran resultados igual que yo .. Suerte. A todas ...
"Amazing results even after a few nights of use along with rapid wrinkle repair day cream and my trusty clarisonic brush. Made my skin more even toned and faded some light age spots, skin felt smoother and looks brighter. Continuing to use this and results get better and better. Excellent product!"
"I am a bit of a product junkie. I really like this one. I have been using it around 10 days and I could see a big difference in my skin within the first few. I use a tinted moisturizer over it and it goes on flawlessly. I am 43, large pores, fine lines, wrinkles and occasionally still break out. I have tried many different high end products, but have never had a a favorite. This one has not caused any negative side effects. No flakiness, no redness, no blemishes. I am pleasantly surprised."
"After years of using high-end beauty creams, I finally found one that works and costs 75% less than the one I was recently using. I'm using this at night in conjuction with other Neutrogena products and my pores are reduced, skin looks brighter, and my acne scarring is diminished."
"I have been a long time user of Neutrogena products, I am 52 years old and feel like my skin is soft and healthy. My Mother who is 76 (does'nt look it) also is very happy with her years of using these products. We both have recently added the Hydro boost serum and Rapid wrinkle repair to our regimen and we are so happy with how it makes our sking look and feel. Love these products."
I loved the feel and scent of the lotion while applying. It made my skin feel very soft. After 3 days I noticed a blister like splotch under my right eye and above my eyebrow. Had to discontinue use after 5 days due to the cream aggravating these spots.
"I am so disappointed in this. I purchased the whole Rapid Wrinkle Line. It has been over a month and my skin is worse than before. Feels like sandpaper. Skin is flaking and peeling and itchy, red and so very dry. I look older and the wrinkles are more pronounced. I have wanted to call but I work 7:30 - 5:30 MST. I would like my money back."
"I have used Rapid Wrinkle Repair for one week on the area above my top lip, my neck and under my eyes. I used an especially small amount under my eyes. I discontinued using it under my eyes three days ago because I experienced redness and burning as well as dryness. Yesterday I immediately noticed the skin under my eyes was puffy and deeply wrinkled. I hope this result is not permanent and I am very nervous about it. Please help!"
"After using this product for one week on limited areas of my face (above mouth, on my neck, and on left section under eyes where very tiny crows feet begin) I experienced stinging, dryness, and redness under my eyes. I had used a very tiny amount of the product in this area and two days ago noticed that I have pronounced deep wrilnkles under my eyes. Hopefully this will disappear with a touch of moisterizer each day. Perhaps the dryness produced from the product caused the wrinkling??? Please help!"
"I bought prep cleanser and regeneration cream. Within 2 days eyes and face got swollen red , itchy and dry. It's been about a week since I totally quit using and my face is still irritated. Still itchy eyes and red on eyelids and flaky skin. Look older around eyes. Not sure what to do. Was told to throw away and not use anymore."
"I started using this cream recently and really liked the results. I was using it a few times a week, then started using it daily....but woke up today with a bright red rash on my neck. (The wrinkle lines on my neck are especially irritated. Yikes.) Neutrogena recommends using this cream twice a day, but no way. At least not for me! Going back to using it sparingly 2 times a week."
"For the first week,the product worked well. I started to notice some redness on my neck so I only used it nightly. I even stopped putting it on my neck. The redness got worse and now it looks like a chemical burn. It is very red,itches and warm to touch. It has been 2 weeks since I stopped using the cream and my neck is still bright pink and itches."
"I was excited to try this to help with fine lines and figured it would be perfect since I had great results with the Hydroboost line. Unfortunately, this caused a burning sensation and made my skin red and flakey. I decreased usage, as directed on the bottle, but the burning feeling never improved for me. The redness/ burnt skin was not pleasent; especially in the crow's feet area. :("
I will go back to the Hydroboost line instead....wish it would have worked for me.
I bought this because it said it was “the highest concentration of retinol”. That is not true. There are several other products that have higher concentration of retinol that are available. I have been using this for over three weeks and it hasn't changed my small wrinkles at all. The only improvement has been my face feels softer. I feel that I wasted my money.
"After using the product, My face was extremely burning around my eyes also my cheek area right below my eyes. The Irratation and itchiness is unbearable as well. The first use was right before bed, I woke up to swollenness around eye lids and the skin right under eyes."
"Starting using the Rapid wrinkle repair two weeks ago. I love it. Have not seen too much of a result yet except that my skin feels smoother and I have had no adverse reactions. It has a very slight fresh fragrance but it dissipates quickly. I will continue to use this daily and wait for awhile before I give a full review, I want to be entirely sure before I comment any further!"
I bought this product about a month ago and I like the results
The product was everything I anticipated when I ordered.
This product is good for hydration skin soft and i would recommend this for hydration not fin lines and wrinkles
I have been using this for about a week now and have not noticed any difference in my skin but hope with continued use
I'm a former flight attendant and now 72 years old and hating the deep lines around my mouth. I've been using the product for two weeks and cannot believe the difference. Thank you! Maybe I should ask for my old job back!
I bought this product after 4 days my skin feels burnt and now have burnt eyelids and red blotches all over my face my whole face feels like it's been burnt
i used this prodcut for a cuople f days .. in the beggining i felt that was burning my skyn but i hoped that it will improve .. but then appeared red stains in my face ... im so sad about the product because i had high expectations
"Your advertisement states in one week we'll see a difference, been over a week & I'm still waiting. Still look the same, have the same wrinkles around my mouth. Wish I could find a product THAT REALLY WORKED"
"I bought this product a week ago and was using it twice daily but cut back to once a day as I noticed redness, burning and peeling particularly around my eyes."
After 2 nights of using this product I have extreme redness around both of my eyes and cheekbones. My skin feels very tight and has a burning sensation. I had high hopes for this moisturizer and am extremely disappointed.
"I'd love trying this, IF it were fragrance free. ANY fragrance is too much fragrance. I guess I'll forget the retinol and stick with the fragrance free hydrogel."
I like Rapid Wrinkle Repair® Regenerating Cream more than I thought I would. It works great with my oily skin. It even works under my makeup. I would definitely use up this jar and seriously think about buying another. Would recommend to my friends.
"I've used this product for 4 days and my skin is patchy dry, bright red, swollen and feels like it's burning. A lot of my products are Neutrogena and I have never had a problem. Please be cautious."
"I love Neutrogena products, but this was NOT it for me. I have many burns to my face and neck. It's hurts very bad. I also used as directed, so I'm disappointed to see this outcome. I will be discontinuing ASAP."
"Have been using all neutrogena products and its been ooh your skin is fresh what i you using... I just can stop. I only need a recommendation for my oily face. since l'm trying to go all natural without any Powers., Just my natural face."
This hurt my under eyes! I can't believe how much it stings to put on that area. I've used retinol before and never had this reaction. Disappointed.
"Using the product for 3 days when itchiness occurred. Figured fever blister, next day discovered rash all over my neck and face, arms and hands! Not sure what caused this exactly but this cream is the only thing different added to my daily rituals."
I tried this for a couple of months and did see a difference but nowhere can I find how much retinol this product actually contains. Hoping someone responds with the percentage.
This product is better than what the stores sell individually. I'm so happy that Sams carries this. The results are great and it's a wonderful product. Thanks Sam's Club!
The product caused my face to sting and burn. My face and eyes became swollen after using for 3 days. The doctor said I had chemical burns and gave me a steroid to releave the swelling.
"Ive used this product for 2 weeks. The area around my eyes has become extremely sensitive (Lids and under eyes) to the point of redness and swelling, have now discontinued use."
ive been using this product for about 5 days and it dried out my skin which is understandable because of the retinol but howeve my under eye is swollen with deep wrinkles that were not there before...is this normal for this to happen?
"No kidding, my friend asked me what had I been doing differently to my skin, I was amazed, I had only been using this product for a week and she noticed an improvement. Thank you Neutrogena. I love this new product. X"
"I received this product as a free sample from PINCHme! I loved it! I love the way it makes my skin feel so soft. I did noticed small changes but enough to make me want to buy the product.. It's great, just like other Neutrogena products!"
I used this twice a day for about 3 days and experienced red itch skin. I cut back to once a day. No relief. I have stopped using it for about 4 days and am still experiencing the same symptoms.
"Been using for one week. Haven't seen to much change. Had to quit using on my eyelids, because they were getting red, and chafed."
I'm going to keep using it for another week.
On my face only. I do like that it is moisturizing.
"My 92-year old mother has used this product for as long as I can remember. Her skin is beautiful!!! Recently, the company changed the container which is much easier for her to use. I applaud them for the change!"
"I used this product for 3 days on my face and neck. I assumed it would be ok since nowhere on the box or jar did it say areas to not use creme. My eyes reddened and swelled, then burned and peeled and my neck had marks that almost blistered."
"I purchases this cream about a week ago. I have used it for the past four days applying as directed. However, I have had to stop. My skin around my eyes has become red, it burns and now the skin is peeling."
I have used this for about a week. First couple of days my face was itchy and had a burning sensation. Today it looks like I have a sunburn. Is this normal? Surely not!
I used the product for 3 days only at night and the burning and redness around my eyes is horrible. Hoping it goes away quickly as it is very painful and swollen!
I just bought the fragrance free and it smells really bad. If it's fragrance free it shouldn't smell at all. I've only used it twice and my skin is soft but sure hate the smell.
I have used this product for less than a week. First day ok. After the second day my skin started to feel hot and burn throughout the day. My skin is now raw all over my face and neck. It hurts to even shower. Will never buy any Neutrogena products again!
I bought this last week and have used it every day. It was fine at first but now I have what looks like a burn on my face. It was very Pait and kept me up. I have had professional chemical peels before and have never had a reaction like this. Under my eyes it has created red swollen bags and was very unsightly. I am three days without the product and it now have dry patches. The pain has subsided but is still irritated. I really wanted this product to work and am so disappointed.
"Texture is rich but not greasy, my skin looks better and smell great!"
I am so happy thank is so good I like it♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤♤
I've been using this for about a year and I love it! Definite improvement in my skin!
"I have smile lines and when I came across this product I was hoping it would help! I have use other products to with little impact. I have been using this product for a week and there is a noticeable difference in the lines by my mouth and the slight ones on my forehead. My face feels great and I feel like I look younger, try it!"
"I bought this about a month ago and took before and after photos. I was hoping it would help with wrinkles but I haven't really noticed the difference. Was on the hunt to find a not-so-expensive solution for early wrinkles and did a lot of research on reviews, etc. I did have dry skin at first and was hopeful that it would start showing some effects but after a month I'm not noticing much of a difference... maybe the other products will work better. Disappointed that I didnt notice much of a difference.."
"I have been using this product for just over 1 week & my skin is extremely flaky & it is also sensitive around my eyes, almost a stinging feeling. Yes, I moisturize, with a very reputable product but I did not think that this product would have such a dramatic drying & stinging feeling. Additionally, I see no results even though the claim is to see results in as little as a week."
.
I received this deluxe sample from pinch me and have used it for about a week. I have sensitive skin and was nervous this would dry out or make my skin red. So far so good no issues or burning this is pretty thick cream that soaks in well and makes my skin feel moisturizer.
"First let me say I have had eczema all my life and this product did not bother my skin at all, huge plus! It went on nicely and did not leave me with an oily feeling. Also, I did not break out like I do with other creams. As for wrinkles, I have a couple under my eyes and those seemed to disappear after using the product for a week. I will be using this product from now on. I received this product for free from Pinch Me so that I may give an honest review."
"it is thick but not greasy, you no you have something on. It makes your skin very smooth"
I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and like it. If I'm using this do i still need the night moisturizer? Or day moisturizer?
"I love this product, but I like to know if it's normal to look like is peeling around my lips and cheeks,,, thank you"
This product is great!! It works quickly and more to the point it works!! So don't change a thing...unless you make it even better
I have been using this for 4 weeks as directed and have seen NO results not even on fine wrinkles. waste of alot of money!
"I have used it for about 5 days, around my eyes they are red, very sore and weeping. I am no longer going to use this."
This product feels good on most of my skin except under my eye area. It is red and almost burnt looking. UGH.
"I like the way this cream works, but do not like the strong fragrance which is so unnecessary and toxic."
"I have been using this cream for about a month now, and face feels amazing. Completely moisturizer and tighter looking. I love this product"
I received a sample from PinchMe. My skin is so much healthier after 2 weeks use. My lines are less noticeable and my skin feels so soft.
I.ove how soft and smooth this cream makes skin. The fine lines around my eyes and mouth are much less noticeable.
"This cream cause my face to burn and my face was red, tomato red. I have the redness for about three weeks now. Would not recommend this."
me gustaría saber si esto hace parte del proceso por que esta como escamandose y dodne ya se ha pelado se ve más suave y más clara. es esto normal?
"I started using this product 3 days ago , woke up today with burning /puffiness around my eyes. My skin is pealing under my eyes. I want my $ back. Would NOT buy this product !"
"I used this for three days and my skin was red, dry and itchy. I reduced the use to once a day. Still same result. I have not used it for 3 or 4 days and my skin is still dry, itchy and red. I still get a burning sensation."
I had been using the light night cream and have trouble to find anyone carrying it. I just tried this wrinkle repair today. My skin feels burning and I hate the smell. Why can't bring back the light night cream? It was the best!
"I used this for about 3 weeks, twice a day as recommended. I saw a little difference in the fine lines, it did soften them some what. I am sure it will do more as long as you use it consistently."
I used this product as a part of my daily regimen. My skin feels fantastic and I am happy to report with my sensitive skin it did not break me out. I would recommend this product to my friends.
I received this as a sample to try and I absolutely LOVE it! It will definitely be added to my daily facial routine. It isn't oily and my face feels smoother after applying it.
I have been using this for about a week now. I have seen no improvement. When applying cream to my face it would burn and sting for a few minutes. This cream has no moisturizing properties and dried my face out tremendously!
"I think it is a great product. I love the smell, and the way it feels on my skin, and it does make my skin glow, well it seems to anyways. Thanks for letting Pinchme send it. I know what to buy from now on. Makes me feel young again"
"After using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Release, my face wrinkles look worse. I'm sad because I spent so much time researching this product before purchasing it. I've used another product with retinal in the past and had a better experience. Now I'm challenged with trying to correct the damage this product caused."
"Help! My skin has worsened since I started using this a week ago. Udner my eyes are so dry and red and it seems like I have developed more wrinkles! Is that possible??. I am stopping this immediately and hope I go back to normal. Is this normal with use? I do use another retinol cream specific to eyes on top of this at night only. Could that be why? Either way, I am never using this again! Is there a refund policy?"
"I just started using this product and it feels very nice and smooth on my face. It indicates to use twice a day, but I don't see any SPF or sunblock rating. I have very light skin so my dermatologist recommends I apply at least SPF 15-30 every day. Do I now need to apply sunscreen over this product?"
I could feel the difference after a few days and see the difference after 7. My skin looks brighter and soft. The product has a good smell to it. It's a good product for your face. I have sensitive skin so it's not irritating to my skin! Would recommend!
"Absolutely an awful product. I had been using it for about three days and like other users, my skin around my eyes starting stinging and it irritated my eyes. I ended up with a form of pink eye in both of my eyes from using this product. My skin around the eye area is still red and hurting from this and from trying to clear up the irritation in my eyes. Stay far, far way from product and don't waste your money."
"I received this as a Christmas gift along with the dark spot corrector. I have been using both faithfully and have not notice a difference from using either of these products. The fragrance in the product is very overpowering, which makes me not want to use it. I will continue to use it until it is gone, put would not purchase it again."
"I am in my mid-50s, and have started getting fine lines on my forehead and in between my eyebrows, and deeper lines just below the sides of my mouth. I have used this cream only on those areas for the past two weeks, and have really noticed a difference in the appearance of those lines, particularly those near my mouth. This cream really softens lines, especially vertical ones. I will continue to use it as I am very happy with the results thus far."
"I really don't have any wrinkles yet, but I've been using this for about 2 weeks. I use this Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair 3 times a week, so my skin doesn't get too irritated. My fine lines are fewer and my skin is very soft. The fragrance is mild, which I like. Not greasy, and absorbs quickly. I will continue to use and see what happens. I received this complementary from Pinchme for testing/reviewing purposes."
"This cream is luscious on my face! My skin was very dry with the Colorado weather, but after using this for a couple of weeks, it's back to feeling great! Some of my wrinkles are not as deeply defined and that is an amazing thing!! ""I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own."""
I received this product as a sample and so far I don't have any complains. I have been using it for more than 1 week and amazingly it works. My skin looks radiant and younger. I would recommend this product because it combines good quality with fast effect.
"I received a free sample of Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair to try, and I was skeptical at first so I thought I would test it on my most embarrassing wrinkles - my neck and upper chest. Too many years of beach days without sunscreen when I was young and carefree have left my neck and ""decollete"" looking older than I am! I took a before picture the morning I started using it, and just compared side-by-side one week later picture. Wow! I'm just amazed by the difference in just a week! Neutrogena, you've got a new fan!"
"I like the texture of this cream it is soft and smooth not heavy, it goes on lightweight on the face and is not greasy. I noticed my fine lines and fine wrinkles were not as noticeable as before. The deep wrinkles I have on the forehead still was noticeable. Overall this product is a good product for the money."
"I've seen a drastic improvement in my skins texture and my frown lines are not as deep and noticeable. I have crazy sensitive skin, so I was really pleased that I was able to use the product. I received the product as a sample through Pinch Me, and I am loving the results already."
"I was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked. It absorbed quickly, and the next morning my skin did in fact, feel smoother and plumper. The fragrance threw me off, it was very intense. I would have liked this product far more knowing testing on animals was not involved."
"In order for these wrinkle creams to work, they have to soak in and feel like are really working! This product does that exact thing."
"I m very pleased with how my skin looks improved after each application, especially when I wake up and look in the mirror."
"I received a free Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair from PinchMe. After about three days, I felt a bit of stinging around my eyes while putting it on, but not painful. However, in less than two weeks, I actually could see results of softer, smoother skin around my eyes and mouth. Thank you, PinchMe and Neutrogena. I doubt I would have found this on my own."
I love how it doesn't leave a greasy film. It goes on smoothly. It makes my skin feel wonderful.
This product is so perfect.for me.superlike.even.the smell...
It burns.....so diappointed. Made a mess of my face.
Great product and great price. I've only been using it for a short time.
"I am using it and it gives me good results, it is a very good product I recommend it"
Everything I read about this product sounds great... BUT what percentage of retinol is in it?! Too much is not good for the skin!
This product left me with painful burns on my neck. I used it only once per day. I had heard good things about this product and am very disappointed.
This stuff is amazing and makes my skin feel very soft.It has a great light scent and soaks into the skin quickly and doesn't feel greasy.
I used this product for only a few days and small red bumps appeared along with itching and white flaking skin especially around my eyes. I have stopped using this product for four days now and I still have the itching and burning. Please help.
I have been using twice a day for months and see no improvements in my fine lines . I just see increase in my credit card bill . Just don't see where it's worth the money.
I received the Rapid Wrinkle Repair® Regenerating Cream from Pinch me for free and after using the product for 2 weeks notice my skin looks so much different. My skin is soft and not soggy anymore. The dark spot getting lighter everyday.
This overnight cream is so gentle but effective in keeping my skin moisturized in the harsh winter months! I love it! Thank you to Pinch Me for giving me the opportunity to try it for my honest opinion. I have found this to be my new go to product!
Great silky texture and absorbs quickly. Was rather skeptical that I'd see improvements in about a week but the fine lines are fainter~!! Will definitely keep using it. Fair price for a product that does exactly what it claims~!!
My skin is extremely soft. I love the way it makes my skin feel. I use to have dry rough skin on my face before I started using the Neutrogena rapid repair cream. My face is flawless now.
"I was hesitant using this at first. I thought that it would irritate my skin, but it did not. It left my skin so soft and the scent is great. I noticed some of my wrinkles began to diminish slightly as well."
"I received this product to try from PinchMe and I love it. Too much sun exposure in my younger years has left my skin in need of help. This cream is thick but absorbs well. After only a few uses, my skins looks and feels healthier."
I was excited that I received this cream free from PINCHme to try out but unfortunately it broke me out like crazy! I have sensitive skin and am prone to breakouts. I hate that it broke me out but it may work great for those with normal to dry skin!
"I received this product free from Pinch Me and I think it's wonderful. It smells great, soaks in quickly and makes my skin feel so soft. I do feel like my face is firmer after using it. I will definitely be purchasing this product in the future."
"It's low-key Poppin, also, love the smell and the consistency. Totally icy, and even if I got it as a testing product, ill be buying more after it's empty."
I recently bought two jar of this cream and after two days my eyes and under the eyes are red and swollen and feel like sandpaper. My entire face burns and I have stopped using the product. I would like a refund.
"this is a negative review of the Rapid wrinkle repair regenerating cream. The amount of retinol is minuscule. Retinol and hyaluronic acid are 7th and 5th FROM THE END. Both are listed after FRAGRANCE, and fragrance should be not more than 1%. This cream stings and burns the face, and my skin isn't even sensitive. Vitamin C in this cream is THE LAST ingredient, which is just a joke."
I think this cream does not go on very smooth and it tends to pull the skin when putting it on. I like a cream that goes on smooth and is not sticky. I think this cream makes your face feel not smooth. I wanted to like it but I like a cream that goes on very smooth!
I recently lost my husband and as a result lost a lot of weight which unfortunately was very evident in my looks (deep lines and wrinkles). I have been using this cream for about three weeks and while I am quite pleased with the results I feel my skin is very dry and tender. Do you recommend using some type of enhanced moisturizer together with the wrinkle cream? Your advice would be appreciated.
"I am so loyal to the Neutrogena brand, so to be able to sample this Rapid Wrinkle Repair was just amazing! I'm nearing 41 years of age, and have fine lines around my eyes and mouth. They are deep, but I notice them. After using this product, that went on smoothly & smelled great - I noticed a definite difference in the texture of my skin. The fact that it warned the user of possible skin redness and flakiness, was a bit alarming - but thankfully, I did not run into any issues. So happy with my results!"
"I have been using this over a week now. the only difference I have is that my skin is silky and hydrated. this product works very well to that. as for the wrinkles, I haven't seen any difference that way. I may or may not buy this again. I guess it all depends on the price."
I started using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair® Regenerating Cream 2 weeks ago. I noticed an immediate improvement in my skin texture. It feels soft and silky now where it was dry before. I have not noticed the drastic changes in my wrinkles on my forehead but the fine lines around my eyes appear to have gotten better. I received this product as a free sample from PINCHme. I will continue to use and will purchase it when I run out because I love the way my skin feels now.
"The first thing I noticed when I opened the bottle was the that it smelled so good! I put a pea sized amount like the instructions said and I thought, ""This is not going to be enough, but I will go ahead and see."" I was amazed on how well is spread! I put it all over my face and neck and waited while it dried. It left my face feeling so smooth and had to show my husband. He was shocked how smooth my face was! I love this product and will be buying more when this runs out!"
"After the first day of using Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream, I was surprised at how wonderful it made my skin feel. It was what I call a skin quencher! It absorbed really well into my skin and after about a week, I could see the fine age lines start to diminish. My skin has actually continued to improve after each use!"
Have only been using this for about 2 week but I am already seeing some good improvement with fine lines and wrinkles much less noticeable. And it goes on easy no sting or redness that some of these cream leave you with. I received this as free sample from Pinch me. All opinions are mine.
"Great product! Neutrogena never lets me down. Always a high quaility product that work great. Fine lines are getting less noticable, softner skin. You only need a small amount it goes a long way and is not greasy. I recieved a full size jar sample from Pinch.com"
"I have been using the product now for a couple of weeks that I received free from PinchMe. I really like the product, the smell is great and it is helping my skin. I notice that it is softer and just brighter looking. I usually have a hard time remembering to apply these types of products on every day but with the results that I have been getting, I have no problem remembering to apply in the morning and night!"
"I use a cream every day on my face day and night, so it's important for me to find a cream that isn't too greasy or oily and isn't too heavy. This stuff fits the bill! This scent isn't too overpowering, and I can use it without worrying that it will make me break out or make me look shiny all day."
"I really liked the full size product that I received from pinch me to try and review. I like the way it made my face feel. Not at all greasy, very quickly absorbs. But I did notice a little stinging sensation, but I think that is normal for the product as it I'd sloughing off all the old skin cells to reveal more new rejuvenated skin. I would definitely buy this product."
I have found this product to deliver on its promise of a visible difference in one week .I have noticed smoother plump moist skin since I started using this product and even had a couple complements on how well my skin looked .Another added bonus is that it does not leave your skin feeling greasy or heavy and has a very pleasant scent
"This cream came to me as part of a PINCHme.com sample and I couldn't have been more pleased. This cream really has made a noticeable difference in the tone of my skin, especially around the eyes and corners of the mouth. I knew that Neutrogena was a brand I could trust but this cream has just upped the ante for me."
"I tried Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream & have already noticed a big difference!! First, it did not irritate my skin, plus, my skin feels so soft & smooth. I really notice less wrinkles in a short time. My skins looks & feels smoother & younger! I will definitely continue to use Neutrogena & will recommend to family & friends!!"
This is my first time to try the Rapid Wrinkle Repair. I received this product complimentary but these opinions are my own! I really like this cream. I have only used it for a week and I can already see the difference it makes. Plus it keeps my skin hydrated and soft throughout the day.
I received this product free from PinchMe to try. I am very pleasantly surprised. After less than a week I started noticing my skin looked smoother. I look less tired. I like than you don't need to use a lot of this cream to see results. It's easy to apply and rubs in nicely. The scent is pleasant. I'm looking forward to the weeks ahead to see if there is continued improvement in the look and feel of the skin on my face and neck.
I received this free sample from Pinchme. I was so happy to get to try this and I was not dissapointed. You could immediately see the results within days. My skin appearance was smoother with and brighter. It was soft to the touch and the lines around my eyes started disappearing. It has a lovely smell. It applies evenly and easily. It does not take much to do your whole face either. I was very lucky to find this awesome product.
"I was skeptical of this product at first, as I have tried many that promised the same and had little to no results. I was very pleased with the way this product minimized my fine lines/wrinkles. I did find; however, that I could only use the product once a day or every other day. Twice a day was too drying on my skin."
"I received this as a free sample from PINCHme! I love this product. I did feel a tingly sensation for a day or so, but no irritation or anything like that. It went on smoothly and felt great on my skin. My skin looks and feels smoother and moisturizer and foundation glide on much smoother. I recently turned 48 and have a few wrinkles here and there and crows' feet when I smile. I have used it for over a week and notice that the wrinkles have lessened and that my skin is brighter with a healthy, youthful glow.  Highly recommend! "
"I received this product to review from PinchMe. I don't have a lot of wrinkles (I'm sure if I lost weight I would look ten years older...great reason to stay fat, right? LOL) however I do have dry patches, sagging jowls and my face just appears tired all the time no matter how much sleep I get. After using this product for a couple of weeks I look a lot more refreshed. I will continue using this product. I gave this 4 stars because it is a bit pricey for someone like me who is disabled."
I have been using the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair for about 10 days now. I put it on in the morning and again at night. My skin feels so soft and I can see a difference in my skins complexion.The appearance of my skin is more even and brighter. This is great to wear under your makeup to.I recommend this product. I received this product for free for PINCHme but my opinions are my own.
Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream works great! It goes on smooth and isn't greasy. The cream is easy to apply and doesn't take long to absorb in the skin. The fine lines and wrinkles have almost completely disappeared. I would recommend this to everyone!
"I have been on the lookout for a new facial cream, and here it is. The difference in the texture of my skin was amazing! I found this cream didn't just stay on top of my skin but actually absorbed, giving me a long lasting softness. The winter wind and cold usually leaves me with dry spots on my face. I'm happy to say that by using this cream, my skin is softer. In fact, my fine lines have pretty much disappeared. Great product! -"
"I received a sample of Neutragena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream courtesy of Pinch Me, and really liked it. The cream made my skin very dry at first, so I began applying it over my usual moisturizer. Since doing that I haven't had any problems and love the way my skin looks and feels after using the product."
"Thank you for my Free sample of Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream. I love the way it leaves my skin feeling so soft and smooth hours after it has been applied. It doesn't burn my eyes and it has a light fresh sent. Once I have used up all of my other creams, I will be switching to Neutrogena. Thanks for introducing me to my new favorite product."
"After receiving a free sample of this product from Pinch me, I was excited to try it as I had been looking for a product to both reduce fine lines and wrinkles and moisturize my skin. I am happy to say this product fits the bill. My skin immediately felt softer and less dry and after using the product for two weeks, I feel my skin looks much younger and more supple. I highly recommend it."
"I was kinda skeptical about this product, I'm kind of a face cream snob. I'd however like to say, this stuff is amazing! When I first received Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair from pinch me I used it the first couple of nights then stopped for a couple. I realized my face felt really soft and supple but then it didn't. I started using again and I will continue to buy as long as these results last! You have to try this to believe it. You will not regret it! !"

I received the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream from Pinch Me for Free. The first thing I noticed when I opened the jar was the smell. It smells really good. I really liked the feel of this cream on my face. It has a light feel to it. Some creams are heavy feeling. I have been using this cream for a week and I can already start to see a difference. I would recommend to anyone to try this cream for yourself.
"This product is similar to others by Olay and Loreal that I use. It has a good texture and smell which is a plus. It provides moisture to dry skin and is not over greasy or oily like some on the market. This is a good product and a trusted name in our home. My daughter uses their makeup and a few other things and it is worthy of the cost. Thank you for allowing me to sample this product, a new fav. :)"
While I have not been using this product for a very long time I can already see improvement in the softness and smoothness of my facial skin. The lines around my eyes and mouth are less noticeable and my overall tone looks more even and brighter. I wasn't sure if I would like this cream moisturizer but after using it I can honestly say it is the best I have tried by far.
I had doubts about this product because I didn't think a drugstore brand could have a great anti-aging product. I was wrong. Very impressed actually. The cream is thick and a little goes a long way. My skin tone and dry skin patches are so much better. I use morning and evenings and have seen a difference in just a couple weeks. Highly recommend!
I have been using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream and it works great! I started using it two weeks ago and I can visibly see the difference in my skin. I only wish I would have taken before and after pictures. I think I found my fountain of youth!
"I would def recommend this anti aging cream// I have been using it 2 x a day and it fees pretty smooth none greasy especially for my oily skin . I have not noticed any redness ,peelng like other retinal products but seems to be a good fit for my 51 yr old skin!"
"I was given the chance to sample this product from PinchMe. All I can say is, ""WOW!!!!"" I have noticed improvement in my uneven skin."
"I was expecting a sample size of the product do when I received a full size, I just HAD to try it and I'm so glad I have been. My face loves this product!"
"I received this cream as a free sample from PINCHme. I have sensitive skin, and was a little worried about how my skin will ""behave"" . Surprisingly though, I didn't have a single problem. There was a slight tinging at first, but that was all. It absorbed well, without being greasy."
"I've been using this product for about 2 weeks , and have had nice results-- fine lines are almost gone, and my skin's over all texture is smoother. I'm going to continue using this product in the future."
I received this product free from #pinchme for review purposes. I have been using it morning and night for a week. My skin is soft and smooth. I find this very moisturizing. Sometimes I feel Anti-Aging products can sting my skin and be a little too harsh for me to use. I personally don't notice a difference yet but that doesn't mean it isn't working. I am enjoying the product and will continue to use it. I know I can't turn back time but I am all for anything that can help my skin look better and more youthful.
"I have used the Neutrogena Rapid Repair cream for three weeks now. All I can say is Wow! I have severe lip lines above my mouth and this is the only cream that makes them almost disappear completely. The cream is thick and hydrating and I think that is why it works so well. Other creams are too thin, this is just right. It also has helped with the fine lines around my eyes but the lips have shown the greatest improvement. I received my repair cream from Pinch me as a free sample."
At age 42 I was starting to see fine lines appear around my eyes and lips. I have tried several other products and none have worked. So when I received the opportunity to try this for free I said why not. I went into it half hearted to be honest. But as time passed so did the fine lines. I am so happy I tried this product. I have already purchased this little bottle of gold and will continue to do so.
I love the texture and feel of this product when it's applied to my skin. It goes on easy and blends into the skin nicely. It immediately provided a smoother difference on my face and neck. I put this on under my makeup and it was a great base for my foundation to easily go on top of. I have noticed a big difference in wrinkles around my neck that have seemed to fade away with each use. I'm excited to continue to use this and see what my results will be after a month. So far so great!
"i recieved a Rapid Wrinkle Repair® Regenerating Cream in the mail to review through PinchMe. i liked the packaging right off the bat, very eye catching. the name explains the benifits as well, so no guess work! i opened the jar and felt the cream. it fely very emoliating, nice and soft, very well hydrating! not too greasy, i even wore makeup with it. i found my skin responded and i saw less fine lines and wrinkels after a weeks use. this cream is compareable to the high end counters creams, without the hefty price tag!"
I received this product in exchange for my honest review. I really like this. It smells amazing and leaves my skin so soft. I haven't used it long enough to notice any real difference in wrinkles but my skin is definately softer and brighter. I will continue to use this.
I received this as a sample and am really happy with it. The cream leaves a nice moisturized feeling and I think my skin is looking better. The only reason it is not excellent is that the fragrance is strong for me but then again I prefer something that is fragrance free normally. I will keep using this cream and plan on replenishing this when it's all gone. I'm a fan
I have been using this product 2x a day for a couple of weeks and the results I got were early on. Finer lines and my skin was smoother within a few days. I also like that it absorbs quickly and is not greasy feeling. It had a clean smell and a jar will last for quite awhile and you do not need to apply very much. I did not experience any blemishes upon switching from my previous moisturizer (Origins) which often does happen when trying a new facial product.
"I recived a free sample from #PINCHmefreesamples. I was very doubtful that this product would work as stated. I tried it for the time period stated on the packaging. I noticed results in 4 days. I am in Love with the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Regenarating Cream. I have tried other products that have made the same claim that i woyld see results in as little as 5 days, this product actually delivered on that claim. I will be buying the whole line from now on."
"The product smells good and a little goes a long way. I put two dabs on and it covers my whole face and past my jawline down my neck. I recently got carded at the Walmart and the cashier could not believe my age (I am 49). He said he didn't think I was that old and to keep doing what I've been doing. I will continue to use this product. I got this full size product free from PinchME to try. I plan to purchase more once it is empty, but I use it twice daily and the jar is still almost full!"
I received a free full size jar of Rapid Wrinkle Repair from Pinchme. I have been using the product about 2 weeks. My skin feels really soft and smooth after I use it. I am beginning to notice that my fine lines appear to be diminishing. #great product #free samples
"I've always been a fan of Neutrogena products, but this is my new favorite. I felt immediate hydration and softness. It went on creamy and light without any irritation. I've used it both day and night and am amazed how much softer my skin is without flaking, and my foundation doesn't pill even when applied directly after this cream. I see my wrinkles and smile lines are less dry and my skin looks and feels smoother."
I have been using Rapid wrinkle repair for about 2 weeks. My skin was very dull and dry from the winter weather. My skin is getting softer and I can see a lightening of sunspots on my skin. I will happily continuing to use this cream and see how it works on my fine lines.
I was so happy to have a chance to try and review Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating cream as I had begun to feel that my former wrinkle repair cream had lost its effectiveness. This cream has a pleasant smell and feels luxurious when applying to my skin. It is an effective moisturizer without feeling greasy. The overall appearance of fine lines and wrinkles appear diminished. My skin tone has become brighter and more even. I have found my new wrinkle repair cream!
"I received a free sample of this from Pinch Me. It absorbs quickly, and feels nice on my skin. I've noticed a little difference in my skin after only about a week of use. I use other Neutrogena products, because they don't irritate my skin. It was nice to be able to try this before buying."
I use this product morning and night. Within a week of using this product my face felt smoother and softer. The fine lines are getting less and the lines around my eyes are improving. I would recommend this product to everyone it smells and feels great on your skin.
I have never been lucky when It to moisturizer for my face. They usually are to heavy and leave me greasy and in some cases broken out. That is NOT the case with Nutrogena's Rapid Wrinkle Repair and Regenerating Cream. As soon as I saw cream I was hesitent. I am so glad I tried it. I already see a difference in the smoothness of my skin and it so soft to the touch.
"wonderful feeling on the skin, it absorbed quickly and since I have oily skin and was worried that this product would look more shiny. I was very happy it not only hydrated my skin but did not leave it heavy and oily. It also helped to smooth my fine line and gave my skin a smoother appearance. I am very pleased with this product."
"I was a little skeptical when I first got this product free from PinchMe to try out, How can a simple small amount of cream that wasn't prescription really work? Well, I used a pearl sized amount twice a day and a little over a week, my little wrinkles started to fade My friends told me that I looked more ""refreshed"" and ""less tired"" nowadays. I can't wait to see how much difference it does the longer I use it."
I received this wonderful product as a sample from PINCHme and I love it. My skin looks and feels so much better than it did with the other skincare products that I use. I have noticed that the wrinkles and fine lines are less noticeable than before. I would definitely recommend this product to my friends and family. I love it.
"I received this product from Pinchme for review purposes and I'm so glad I did! The cream is amazing. Thick enough to know it's working, but easily absorbed...and absolutely no greasy residue. The scent is lovely, too. I've used it now for about a month and have already seen results...less noticeable wrinkles, softer skin and a nice glow. I'm hooked!"
"I tried this cream for a week, using it twice a day, as directed. The first thing I noticed is it Absorbs Quickly and goes on smoothly. It has a pleasant smell which is not overwhelming. The cream is not greasy. My skin feels tighter, pores are smaller, and skin looks healthy and moisturized. The retinal does dry out my skin a little. I will continue to use this product."
"I got this product as a free sample from PINCH ME and it is fantastic. i have only used it for 14 days and I have noticed a dramatic difference in my completion and softness. My dry and wrinkly skin is now very supple. I hope this will help in the long term with my crows feet, fine lines and wrinkles. Will keep on using and will update on my results. My husband has already noticed the difference!"
I got this product from pinchme.com to try and I loved it. I didn't really expect to see a real difference but I did. I feel that my fine lines were less visible after using this cream.
And while I personally prefer fragrance free creams the fragrance in this one was not too strong. I will definitely continue to use the cream in the future.
I received a sample of neutrogena rapid wrinkle repair right before the Christmas holidays which everyone knows means stress. I started using it. And by Christmas day the frown lines were almost gone and my crows feet were not as noticeable. Thank you Pinch me and Neutrogena.
"I received this as a free sample from Pinchme and I must say that I love this product! I thought that it would be like all the other anti-wrinkle creams that I've used...like, just average..but it wasn't. This cream is very rich and made my skin look radiantly supple and plump.; and this was after one use. I use it twice a day (morning &a night) and I've noticed a difference in the way my skin looks (younger looking). I will definitely go buy this product when I run out."
"Skeptical at first but I started noticing results within a few days! My skin felt smoother and looked more radiant. The fine lines around my eyes disappeared and even the deeper smiles lines seemed to reduce in size. My pores seemed to shrink as well. Other than the perfume smell, which I got accustomed to, I love this product! It was like having a mini face lift!!!"
"When I opened the box from Pinchme,I couldn't believe what I was looking at. They sent me a free jar of Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair!!! Let me just say,I have been wanting this for quite a long time. And when i say this product delivers,it delivers. My skin already looks feels and smells incredible!! I couldn't be more excited!"
I received a generous sample of this thru PINCHme to try. I was glad it was a large enough sample to really give it an ample try and not just try it for a day or two. I'm just into my 50s with a small amount of wrinkles and found this really did ease those lines between the eye brows and pretty much eliminated those above my lip which aren't as deep.
"I liked the way this felt on my skin, although the scent is a little too strong for me. I don't like to wear scented items but once I started using it every day I got used to the smell. I noticed that it smoothed out some wrinkles around my eyes and it left my skin feeling smooth. It's reasonably priced for a product in this skin-care category and I like that it doesn't have a greasy feeling to it."
I'm reviewing this product as part of a free trial from Pinchme.com.
Made my skin very soft and is not greasy.. Light scent and a great product. Received as a sample from Pinchme
My wrinkles seem to be fading and my skin feels super soft wherever I applied the cream. Loving it so far!
This cream irritated my skin to the point where it's now raw. Didn't see any improvement at all but the opposite
question? what is the difference between this produce and rapid wrinkle repair other than spf30 and moisturizer? I have used both. See no difference in my skin. I still use them both. I guess it is better than nothing at all.
"You know i never put much thought into my wrinkles ,however since i started using this Neutrogena Repair cream i have not been noticing my wrinkles but my soft skin and not to mention it smells great."
I received this product to sample from PINCHme. It works great. I can tell that some wrinkles and small lines are becoming finer already! I think this is a really good product.
I have been using this product for only 4 days and I can notice a big difference. Since my skin is very sensitive I only use it once a day and so far no problems except hard lines are diminishing and skin is very soft!
I have tried so many face moisturizers and I finally found one I would use. The smell is pleasant and not overpowering. Definitely plan on adding this to my facial regiment! I did receive a free sample from Pinchme.
"I have not realized a reduction in my sparse wrinkles as of yet, about 2 weeks of use, but fine lines are fewer and my skin is very soft. The fragrance is mild, which I like. I will continue to use and see what happens."
I received Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Cream from PinchMe.com and I'm so happy I did. My skin feels great. My skin is softer and my fine lines are less noticeable. I've only been using it for a week but I can't wait to see what a month using it brings.

When I first stared using this my skin was a bit red and I had lots of peeling. But after that I notice a visibly smoother skin that was soft to the touch. I LOVE this product! My skin tone is evening out as well.
I received a free sample from Pinch Me and I love it! This product doesn't feel heavy or greasy and I have oily skin. I can not wait to purchase more.

"After using the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair my skin is smoother and looks younger. I really like the that has retinol SA,Glucose Complex, Hyaluronic Acid and my wrinkle is less visible. The scent is light and is easy to use."
I like how easy this was to use. I could actually could feel it tingle my skin after applying it. It also smelled great. I have been using it a couple of weeks and my skin feels nice.
I love this product! I have dry skin so I was a little skeptical about this cream. I have to say it kept my skin feeling nice and moisturized. I did notice some of the fine lines getting softer. This is a keeper!
This is the first facial cream that I still get excited about after using it a few days. The dry skin on my face is gone and I have actually seen a difference where I used to have small wrinkles.
Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream is a god sent. I have only been using it for 3 weeks now and my skin feels and looks great. My skin is soft and smooth and it is very gentle on my sensitive skin.
"I love this product. It is not heavy and I can really tell the difference in my skin, after only using it for a little over a week. My skin is smoother and the wrinkles are softer. I will be purchasing!"

I haven't been using this product for very long to notice if really will reduce the look of the wrinkles or not but I do love the way it makes my skin feel! I can't wait to see what happens in the month to come with further use of this product!
"I LOVE this product! My face feels so soft hydrated after using it only a couple of times. It doesn't feel greasy at all. And as a nice bonus, it has a lovely light scent!"

"this cream made my skin feel like silk. It was so soft and smooth, it felt great. I have to go get more, because the free sample is just a sample, and i need more. cant wait to make this a daily ritual"
I like the lightness and no grease filling it was very easy to wear under my make I will differently be purchasing this product and telling all my friends about it.
Thank you for letting my try it.

After the very first day of use I noticed that my skin was plumper and smoother.I even received comments about how much better my skin looked . Fine lines and wrinkles also diminished. I will continue to use this product.
Rapid Wrinkle Repair® Regenerating Cream smells nice and is creamy. I have not had any redness or stinging. The verdict is still out on how well it repairs my skin.
"I received a free sample of this product from PINCH ME. I have used it for just over one week, and can honestly see results! Fine lines on my face are much less pronounced, and my face feels more elastic and younger. Great product!"
"I received my Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream from #PINCHME. It was a free sample. I love the way my skin feels, looks and smell after using this product. It is truly amazing! My skin hasn't looked this good in years!"
I have been using this on my face since receiving it free from Pichme and I have a new favorite.
"Yes, it has helped with fine lines, and I also enjoy the smell of the product."
"I use this twice a day, its smooth and go on clear, helps with my eye wrinkles and neck wrinkles love this product, this the only product I will buy from now on"
I'm blown away by how quickly it makes your skin feel hydrated. It's really changed my view of creams. I actually look forward to cleaning my face and putting Rapid Wrinkle on! I love it and it is now a staple in my everyday! thank you!!!
I have used a lot of pricey and prescription retinol products. This is the first that I have used that delivers prescription results for a fraction of the cost. I love this product and will definitely continue to use it!
This product is amazing. I received it as a free sample from PinchMe. This will be a regular purchase for me from now on. I could see results in as little as two days.
"I knew this was different the first time I used it, I immediately noticed a difference in the way it felt on my skin and I swear in just a few days I noticed my wrinkles were less obvious"
"I have very dry skin not sensitive just dry as I get older. Love this cream - make my skin feel so soft and hydrate. Great product will def repurchase when I run out, Great value its a large size so it will probably last me awhile."
I am really in love with this product. It goes on so smooth and smells great! The best part is that I have noticed an improvement in my skin in just a few weeks.
I received this product as a free sample from PINCHme and I must admit that it has made my skin look and feel so refreshed and young! I think that this is a wonderful product!
"I received this as a sample and will likely continue to buy it. While I do wish it came in an unscented version, the scent is pleasant. I applied it to my worst facial lines and can tell a difference after a few weeks of use."
It's okay
"I purchased this product from watching a you tube recommendation. I was looking for a 2nd anti aging cream to change up from my regular ** night cream. I find the scent of this product to be pleasant, it goes on well. Tried it day & night but changed just to pm since it doesn't work well with my BB cream in the am. Don't find anything great about it. I've had a little tingling one time. Would I buy it again? Maybe."
"After several uses, I learned to only use it at night time. Even though it gets absolved well, it tends to make my face shinier during the day time. I do have oily face, so I only use this cream at night time. It goes on smooth. It doesn't feel sticky like other creams. After about 2 weeks of usage, I haven't seen any difference in appearance of wrinkles. But I'll continue to use it."
I received a sample from PinchMe for the Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating cream and I love it. It really does make wrinkles decrease and makes your skin so soft. The cream has a faint smell. The smell of the cream was not bothersome! I would recommend this product. I used this product for over 2 weeks and I noticed a big difference. My wrinkles were less visible and my skin looked younger. My skin had a nice glow to it! I love it!
This product works great. I will continue to use it.
