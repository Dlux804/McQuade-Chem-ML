3.4,"['1', '2', '1', '1']"
This cream is wonderful for my very dry skin. It is a thick cream and really moisturizes my skin. You can't beat the price and it feels like an expensive cream.
"Very moisturizing without being oily. So far, my skin really likes it, and there are so many products out there that it can't tolerate."
"Very nice product! A bit heavy for day use ! All natural, but has strong scent if you have sensitive skin. Great price"
