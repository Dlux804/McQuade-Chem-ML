"My Korean friend mentioned about this product. I would like to try it. Walmart sells it at low price to compare with other vendors online. So far I have been using it for two weeks, I like it and put it on in morning and at night after clean my face because it is dry quick and no sticky/oily. My skin feels refreshed, smooth, hydrated and plus unscented."
AMAZING. I noticed results within a couple of days. My skin loves this stuff. One of my favorite beauty purchases of the year.
This product is great! No scent. No oily residue. Absorbs quickly. I could feel my skin being hydrated as soon as I first used it.
