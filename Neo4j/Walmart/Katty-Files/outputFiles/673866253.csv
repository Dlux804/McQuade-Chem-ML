It feels lightweight for my Uber sensitive skin. I used 30spf but wanted to try this and it feels good and lighter. This brand is the only one I can use that doesn't break my skin.
"I came to this web site to see where I could buy this. This is the best facial lotion I've ever tried and after a pharmacy merger I'm having a hard time finding it. I've been using it for years, and my face still looks just the same. I love the pump because it is so much easier to put on than the jar."
I have extremely sensitive skin and I'm prone to breakouts with too much moisture and terrible dry skin without it. This lotion is the perfect balance! My skin has never felt better! I have made family & friends try it and every one of them has loved it and you will too!
"Been using this for years! I love that my sensitive skin tolerates this, it has anti-wrinkle properties, AND has SPF protection all-in-one product. My only suggestions for improvement would be to increase the SPF protection and make it more readily available. I cannot find it anywhere locally and have to resort to ordering online."
"I've used eucerin products for about 25 years. Eucerin products are light , not expensive and do the work. I use the face wash and moisturizers."
I get so many compliments on my skin since I started using this product. I do have a heard time finding the lotion though but it is wonderful because of the pump and the texture makes it easy to put on my face.
"Something happened within the last 3-6 months. This formulation is very different than before. The label used to say for sensitive skin, it no longer does...even though it is listed in the description on this site. For years I had searched for a sensitive skin face lotion with spf that would not get all gunked up in my facial hair. This new formulation does not absorb into the skin as well and sticks to my beard way more than the old product."
Great product for those with very dry skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Best product ever hands down! I refuse to buy anything else!
I have been using this lotion for over five years. I am always getting compliments on my skin and I am 62 years old. I would recommend it to anyone.
"This is a very nice moisturizing lotion. It is not too heavy, blends well and leave skin soft, smooth and hydrated. My only disappointment with it is that it does not provide a broad spectrum sunscreen. Please consider making this with a broad spectrum SPF 30 sunscreen, or, alternatively, leave the sunscreen out so this can be used as a night time lotion. The only reason I would not recommend this to a friend is because the sunscreen is lacking."
"When my doctor told me 15 years ago that I had Diabetes, he suggested I start using Eucerin Lotion and gave me samples to try. The lotions actually seemed to heal my dry spots and bits of eczema. Since I have extremely sensitive skin I decided to give the Q10 Anti-Wrinkle a try. I've been using it for 14 years now. I wouldn't want to face a day without it. I'm 54 and people guess my age at 32 :)"
I have extremely sensitive facial skin. This is literally the only thing that calms my red skin. Every other facial product I've tried breaks me out.
"I really like the way this lotion feels on my face, and I know it also protects with a light sunscreen (SPF 15). It .leaves my face feeling firmer and clear. I will definitely continue using it."
"This lotion has a strong sunscreen smell. It makes the area around my eyes burn, which I'm guessing is from the sunscreen. I wish they made one for sensitive skin without the sunscreen."
