"5 stars for sure!!! First off - it works!!! I have a few spots on my face that are a different color. Who knows why. But this cream has helped and smoothed out the difference so you don't even see it. Second - MADE IN THE USA!!! Nothing more to add to that greatness. Third - Smells AWESOME!!!! It just smells clean like. Fourth - It's day and night TOGETHER. I don't need a bunch of different creams laying around, this is both in one. IT ROCKS"
"Been using this cream for a few weeks now. It smells great and makes my skin feel soft and youthful again. I've noticed that my skin tone has evened out more, less dark spots. It's lasted a long time, also, even if I used 2x daily. I'm impressed with quality and value. Will purchase again!"
"I ordered Active Bamboo Skin Brightening Cream and I think it's wonderful! First, I love that it's made in the US. I'm already seeing a difference in a dark spot on my cheek, that is making me so happy. It's very soothing and does not leave my face or hands (yes, I'm using it on my hands too) feeling greasy or like a film has been left on. My face appears to have an evener skin tone and more radiant. This is a super skin whitening cream and I would recommend it to my friends."
I could tell right away my skin felt and looked more moisturized and way smoother then it was before and love that the ingredients are naturally based. I always try to use as much natural products on my skin as possible and love that about this product.
"I'm going to be 48 and started noticing some “ spots “ in my hands. I saw this and gave it a try and my little dark spots are starting to lighten up and my hands don't look like an old lady anymore. Very nice, rich cream. Not greasy at all, absorbs fast and smells nice too."
I loved this product from the first time I used it.Non greasy and I could see a difference soon after the first application mu skin was smoother and spots were already lighter
I really enjoyed using this. It is lightweight and creamy. So easy to use. It spreads quickly and evenly. It makes your skin feel so soft and smooth. All in all a really good cream to use
Took care of my wrinkling on my neck and helped with dark spots on my face!
