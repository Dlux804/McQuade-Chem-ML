"Bye bye anti age and anti dry! Wow! Blew my mind. Love cosmetics, love trying new skincare. Saw ingredients, clean ingredients, then saw price. Bought the trial size anti aging kit, I'm 52. Talk about quality! Estee Lauder met her match."
"The Earth to Skin tea time starter set is wonderful. It includes a cleanser, day cream, night cream, and an eye cream. I love that these products fight the signs of aging and reduce my large pores. There are so many natural ingredients in this product. White tea extract, mushroom extract, shea butter, jojoba oil and olive oil to name a few. This is a really nice product for your skin. Leaves my skin feeling so soft and luxurious"
"It's a good basic starter kit for trying a set of different products without investing a fortune before seeing results. I think most women who are pro-active about skin care already have select items and brands they use loyally, but for those looking to switch or experiment, the products in this kit offer an opportunity to try the brand."
"Overall, I did like this Tea Time Starter Kit. It's nice that it included all routine products including a cleanser, eye cream as well as a day and night cream. It has a nice light scent, but not sure if it worked that great for my combo/oily skin."
"I like the variety of products that is included with this starter kit! Makes a great gift. I enjoyed the cleanser product, it lathers well and leaves my face clean. I didn't particularly care for the facial cream. The day cream left my face feeling oily and that is something I'm not too fond of. Others may really enjoy this starter kit but the products just aren't a right fit for me personally. I received this product in exchange for review."

"the facial wash, left my skin feeling deep cleaned, i felt it tighten up on my face, so i actually felt it working. the day cream and the night cream, went on smooth, absorbed fairly quickly, and left my skin feeling very moisturized. the eye cream absorbed really fast, and left my eyes feeling very smooth. i liked this kit a lot. my favorite out of it was the facial cleanser. i highly recommend and i will continue to purchase."
"LOVED this Starter Set! Let's start with the cleanser - SO refreshing and leaves your skin feeling SO clean. I also loved how light-weight the eye cream and moisturizers felt. During the hot & steamy summer months, the last thing you want to put on your face is a heavy, greasy cream! While I didn't notice any major changes in existing fine lines and wrinkles, I feel confident that the products were fighting the good fight in the background! I will likely purchase the full size set!"
"First of all, please know I am a dedicated Mary Kay Cosmetics user for the last 40 years. I have tried some of the new skin care lines but always come back to MK. I tried the Tea Time Starter kit and there is absolutely no comparison between my standard and this product. I wasn't thrilled with the feel of my skin, nor the overwhelming scent of the Tea Time kit."
I like all the products in the Tea Time starter kit. It is affordable skincare all in one package. It was lightly scented. I like that it is not tested on animal. It didn't make my face break out. And it did not feel tacky on my face. Too early to notice any changes.
"This little starter kit is great. It's perfect for on the go. If traveling I normally don't pack skincare because it's normally bulky. But this is the perfect size to take. Not only that this gives you a chance to try the products without spending the money for the regular size. Each product is made from different teas, which I love."
"The Teatime starter kit is filled with White Tea Extract and other plant extracts. The products are enriched with the plant extracts that helps to detoxify, cleanse and moisturize the skin. The result is a luxurious benefit to the skin by cleansing it of harmful impurities and in so doing, replenish and retain moisture within the skin. This starter kit has no harmful additives."
"Earth To Skin Tea Time Starter Kit is a kit full of wonderful products! The cleanser cleans skin well without drying. The moisturizers definately work well! My skin is dry and I can never get enough moisture but with these moisturizers, I do not find myself using as much. They eye cream is great as well. All have a light scent. I have had no irriation or issues with this kit, just clean, hydrated skin!"
I've been using for a few days now. So I go off that. Well to me seem a little greasy when useing the lottion for your face day/night. It has no smell at all. For people who don't like smells. The eye cream seems so far to be working. Not as puff my eyes and my fine lines. Are there but not as noticable. I'm going to keep using the product till done. But over all is good.
"I'm very pleased with this product why ? It goes on so smoothly doesn't leave a oil residue on skin that is great being my skins already that way really see the results as well the four piece set is amazing smells great, doesn't make me breakout I love that .The day and nite cream makes me feel refreshed and alive with all the ingredients mixed together makes this all happen and I'm really happy the eye cream takes down the puffyness I really hate it's a product I will be buying more of and I've recommend as well."
"After trying Tea Time Starter Kit my face feels so smooth and is getting firmer by the day. It has taken alot of my wrinkles away with just the first couple uses. Using the white tea cleanser, you can just feel all the dirt coming off your face with each circle as you lather. Then using the day and night cream adds that smooth finish to make your face feel so clean. The chamomile eye cream had gotten rid of my puffy bags under my eyes and I feel so much more confident. I definitely love the Tea Time Starter Kit!"
"This kit is awesome! I love how it makes my skin feel. After using this, my skin feels so much softer. My skin feels refreshed and i want to buy more from this brand."
"My favorite is the night cream, because it doesn't make skin feel as oily. When I take a shower the steam makes my skin more oily and it's nice to have a product that helps my skin feel clean."
"was seriously one of the best skincare kits ive ever used, i absolutely love the chamomile eye cream, it i defintiely a must have for all ladies everywhere. As soon as i run out I definitely plan on buying more."
"Overall its Ok. I like eye cream but dont care about face creams. They to heathy ,greasy and cause acne. Maybe good for winter but not for area where I live."
A little goes a long way and there was plenty in that little starter kit... I'm still using it today. I was afraid of the moisturizer leaving my face feeling oily but it didnt at all. Like the fact that everything was pretty much odorless.
This kit worked pretty well with my skin but broke me out a little bit after the first day. Continued use showed it helps keep the skin healthy looking.
It made my skin so soft and can tell that the fine lines are starting to lighten up. It smells wonderful and works great. Foams up wonderfully. I started using it as my daily routine.
"I felt like the tea time skin care kit dried out my skin and I had a influx of breakouts while testing it, it smelled great but wasn't right for me or my skin"
This was a great way to try this line of products they are amazing. Very easy to use smells great and feels amazing. My skin felt hydrated and fresh after the first use. I love it and would recommend it to anyone! I absolutely love this whole set!
"A beautiful assortment of premium beauty product were such a pleasure to use as a complete facial treatment. The cleanser, day cream, eye cream and night cream are made to use together for ultimate results. These are so good I used them daily."
"The face wash is gentle, yet cleans deeply (& smells GREAT!!). The night and day creams are fantastic. They are non-greasy and feel wonderful. The eye cream works immediately to tighten the areas around they eyes. All around great kit!"
The cleanser leaves my face feeling clean of makeup. I use the day/night cream and it leaves my skin feeling moisturized. The eye cream is my favorite. Leaves my eyes looking refreshed
"The Tea Time Starter Kit leaves my skin feeling so soft and clean! It's even good for sensitive skin, as I have sensitive and acne prone skin. This is mild and smells wonderful too! I definitely recommend!"
"I did like the cleanser because it washed the oily creams off my face. I tried leaving the night, day and eye cream on but it just felt too oily to leave on. I did not like it."

Wow love how how this made my face looked after only one time of using.

"So, for price alone I rated it 3 stars. I'm assuming any regular skin care routine is better than no skin care routine. I purchased the entire full size tea time anti aging products. Cleanser, toner, serum, day cream and night cream, eye cream. It has been about a week, and my face is so broke out it's unreal! I'm 35 and do not have an acne problem. Well I didn't until now. Do not recommend."
"My only criticism of this product line is the day cream not having SPF. Other than that, I really like the products. The day cream isn't too thick or greasy and the night cream feel great even in the morning."
Sample size. I found the cleanser very drying and the texture of the eye cream was not something I liked and it was irritated one of my eyes.
I love it! Been using it for a week already and i love how it moistorized my face. I have really bad dryness and this was just perfect!
