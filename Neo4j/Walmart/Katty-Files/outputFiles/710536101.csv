2 months ago I started using this lotion. My mom used it regularly when I was growing up. I used to love they way she smelled after she applied it. The scent is fabulous!! I love the way my skin feels and I've had several compliments about the way my face looks. I'll take it! Love this!! Thank you Olay
I have purchased Oil of Olay Complete for 30 + years. This product is absolutely wonderful. I use it everyday and people say I do not look my age. I tell them that is what prolong use of Oil of Olay will do for you. My skin is very soft. Please never discontinue this product.
"I have used Olay beauty fluid ""forever"". I love it because I have sensitive skin & it is not greasey. My problem is I can not find a small bottle (travel size) to carry on a plane. Last time I flew they took my 6.0 oz. bottle from my overnite bag as they said it was to large per their requirements. I have found all minature size of everything else I need/use except my Olay. Please advise, thank you."
"please olay, keep FOREVER. this is a classic and always trusted. my 40 year old teacher uses this and i swear she looks 28 or 29. omg i love this stuff and i hope you keep this around forever... always trusted. from the 50""s and 50 yewars later its still around but please keep it for another 50!!"
I have been using the original beauty fluid lotion since I was 18 years old. I am now 44 years old. No one believes my age. I am told I look not a day over 30 years of age. Thank You Oil of Olay!
"I have used the original Oil of Olay for over 35 years. When asked way back 35 years ago the secret to my healthy looking skin, I shared with an audience in a beauty pageant that it was Oil of Olay. Why ruin the perfect product now after all these years. Please bring back the original scent because the new scent is no longer original."
i recently bought a new bottle of Original active hydrating. I was disappointed to find out that they changed the fragrance from a soft neutral scent to a much stronger flowery scent. very disappointing. why did they mess with a great product? after 30 years of use i'm now thinking of finding another prooduct.
"My mom starting using this product back 70's. That's why I also starting using it in my 20's; I knew it was that good. However, since you changed the scent and texture, I'll not be purchasing this product again. Good job, corporate. Looks like from the previous reviews, you've lost a lot of loyal ladies."
I've used oil of olay for 25 years. In the last year you've changed it so it goes on like Vaseline. At the end of this bottle I'm looking for another product unless you go back to the old formula. Also the new packaging makes it look like a cheap Chinese knockoff product - I wasn't sure I'd got the genuine product at first it was so nasty.
I have used Oil of Olay for 40 years. The new formula stinks so bad that I cannot use it and it is so thick that it no longer feels refreshing and light on my face. I HATE the new formula - please go back to the old one. Until then you have lost a loyal customer. Wish I could give it 0 stars.
"I happened upon an original style pink bottle of Olay in my Arizona grocery store. (used to be called Oil of Olay when I was younger). I had always liked it years back, and the price was great, so I thought I'd try it again. It smells the same which I always loved, and the fluid was the same as before. This doesn't clog my pores, and actually improved the look of them. Very pleased, and will stay with this great old friend."
"Why would you change the formula and fragrance? I have used Oil of Olay for 30 years because my mother taught me to, as she always had before me, and now my daughter uses it. But we won't use it anymore, I opened a new bottle and the smell was horrid and the cream was thick and unpleasant. Garbage. Please bring back the perfectly good product you had."
I have been using Oil of Olay every day for 44 years (since I was 16). I have always loved the scent and the way the lotion feels on my skin. Today I opened a new bottle and was horrified by the new scent. I also didn't like the feel of the lotion on my face & neck. Please bring back the original formula as soon as possible. I won't be using the new version of the Oil of Olay. I am going to return the bottle I have bought for a refund.
"I am 61 years old and have used Oil of Olay Beauty Fluid daily for 42 years. I have always loved the light feel and scent of Oil of Olay and I attribute my clear and wrinkle-free complexion to daily use. I recently bought a new bottle of Oil of Olay. When I applied it, I immediately felt a difference. The new formula is thick, hard to apply and it doesn't absorb quickly. Gone are the light feel and scent that I love. I am so disappointed! PLEASE bring back the old formula!"
"Like others, I recently opened a new bottle & thought it had become rancid. I looked up the shelf life & that's when I found all of these negative reviews. I will no longer buy this product. This saddens me as I have used it for decades. The original formula was light and refreshing, something rare in most facial lotions. Your team needs to listen to the public on this one."
"I have used Oil of Olay for years and this new scent & formula is the reason I will not be buying Olay products again. The original Olay is what made your company famous and now you have totally ruined it by changing the scent! Your signature fragrance and original formula made your company famous! You have ruined it for me and alot of your faithful customers! I have read many similar reviews & I know I am not alone in this! If you care, PLEASE listen!"
"I have been a loyal customer for many many years. As was my sister, daughter, mother, & grandmothers. I can't even begin to explain how upset & disappointed I am! Why in the world would you go and ruin such a beloved classic! I really don't know what I will do without it, but the new formula & scent are terrible! Please please go back to the original formula! So very disappointed!"
"I have been using the original oil of olay for over 45 years. I recently bought a bottle and took it back to get my money back because I thought it was spoiled, it smelled horrible. I bought another and the same thing. Took it back and tried one more time. It stinks also. It used to feel refreshing like water. Now it feels like any other lotion."
"I've been using this since high school and I recently replaced a bottle and WOW! The fragrance was absolutely disgusting. Like junior high perfume that gives you an instant headache. Even after washing my face, I can still smell it, it's so overpowering. I am so disappointed. Taking it back to the store."
"I have been buying Oil of Olay products for years. The scent was what I came to know as the Olay signature. I purchased a new bottle thinking I was getting what I was used to and ""yuck"" the scent upon opening the bottle was awful. I won't use it and will take it back to the store."
"The new scent is so overwhelming and disgusting. I loved the active hydrating beauty fluid but will no longer continue to use it. I called Olay to voice my opinion and they sent me a coupon to try another one of their products. Sorry, it's not the same. My skin loved the original formula. Why on earth would you change such an iconic item? I'm now one of the many customers you lost due to this change."
"Been using this product for decades. When I opened the last container I thought it had gone rancid and threw it out. Bought another, then realized it was a new scent. It's awful :( The scent for years has been soothing and signature. Definitely looking for a new product"
"I have used Oil of Olay for more than 40 years, and managed to survive the last time you ""improved"" the product. I opened a new bottle of ""Original"" the other morning. The smell annoyed me, but then my skin itched and little red pimples popped up on my cheeks. Immediately, I washed my face, reapplying with my sensitive skin sun screen Olay. Please pull this monstrosity and return the TRUE Original to the shelves. As others have written here, I do not know what other product to use."
"Frankly this New Look product Sucks!! It stinks !! Just like the product you tried to introduce years ago , it is Not The Same Product!! I am spending a fortune buying up any of the “Original” that I can find...why ? New mgmnt? You are joking about this (Example: review ) below .. right? I have used Olay Original since my 20's I feel that as a Loyal consumer of this product I have been betrayed."
"I am 68 years old, and have used this all my life (as did my mother). The ""new"" product's odor is terrible. I had to immediately wash it off. Cannot tell you how disappointed I am since I did use this every day. Have no idea what I will use now. Actually heartbroken."
"What on earth is going on? After using the same REGULAR (pump) foaming face wash for yrs, it changed & I've scoured everywhere buying up the prev. version. THEN pink cream ribbons body wash changed w/choices of lavendar, strawberry & other ridiculous scents. Ew, I'm not 90 or 12. NOW - you've messed with the ULTIMATE product of all? The original beauty fluid?? When I opened my new bottle, I actually thought it was counterfeit bc it smelled so bad. 20+ years & I am officially done. Sad, really."
"For almost 50 yrs. Oil of Olay has been the only daily moisturizer I've used. I've recommended it to family & friends-especially when they made nice comments about my skin.Sad to say, I no longer recommend it & have gone to the generic instead. Why? Because of the awful smell it has now. Olay has expanded the line (and I use one of the Regenerist night creams) so why the need to make such a drastic change in your core product? Makes no sense. Goodbye to my Oil of Olay..makes me sad."
"I have been using this classic for thirty years and always have a few boxes stowed away ready for use. I just opened a box and thought something was wrong with the product or that I had purchased the wrong formula....so disappointed because I can't use this new, chemical smelling cream....you can't call it origianl olay because it is not!"
"I'm really disappointed that Olay's Original Beauty Fluid is no longer ""original."" It is not the same product anymore and it smells like dead flowers were harvested from a racquetball court. I will not be buying this product again unless it is changed back."
"After using for 40 plus years, I was shocked when I opened a new bottle and immediately smelled a ""petroleum"" odor. I thought the bottle was bad and returned to store for a replacement. Unfortunately, the replacement smelled just as bad. I am VERY disappointed and will not be buying this again."
"On first use from a new bottle, I noticed the change in scent. It has a bad ""chemical"" smell now. The old scent was light and floral--just right. I've used this product for 20+ years. My daughter has always told me, since childhood and now as an adult, how much she loves the way I smell, and that is from the original scent of Oil of Olay--I don't use any other beauty products or perfumes. Please change the scent back. I've called the 800 # and asked for my money back and voiced my opinion."
Please return to the previous formula. I purchased the lotion recently expecting the familiar scent and immediately noticed the new fragrance. To me it has an almost acrid odor— a very strong chemical smell like petroleum/gasoline. I had to immediately rinse it off. I looked online to see if it had been recalled. I was relieved to see that others had a similar reaction about a change to the scent. Please be aware that the change is noticeable and I am not able to use the product. Thanks.
The new fragrance and formula are a disappointment at best. The lotion doesn't feel the same and the fragrance is not pleasant. After 50 years of continued use my skin is youthful looking but I won't be using the replacement product. Nor will my daughter and daughter in law as they feel the same way. I will have to search for a new moisturizer.
I have used Oil of Olay since I was 14. I recently purchased a new bottle after running out and immediately noticed the scent has changed. Why? Part of the reason I love Oil of Olay is because of the scent. Why change something that doesn't make it any more effective. I know a lot of woman will feel the same way. Please go back to the original scent.
"Something's WRONG... I've used Olay beauty fluid for 19+ years! Loved the fresh lite scent and the many complements on my 45+ years youthful skin. BUT recently, I ran out and purchased a new bottle. Immediately I noticed a difference. The label had no image of the lady's face or gold emblem. I also noticed the lotion was different and the smell was a rose-scent. I used it once; but I want my money back! WRONG MOVE in changing such a great product. Not Happy... OLAY!"
"I've used Olay beauty fluid for 20 years with wonderful results, but I have noticed a change. The USA-only packaging looks like a cheap knockoff: the label has no image of the lady's face, the font is altered, Olay doesn't carry the Registered symbol, and there's a typo on the box (sooth). Most importantly, the cream seems greasier and it's very rose-scented. I don't want to use on my face because it's all I can smell for the next hour. Sadly, I'm shopping for a new moisturizer. What happened!?"
"I'm a woman with SLE, and my facial skin is very sensitive and prone to rash. Regular water-based moisturizers are extremely painful and irritating, even ones that claim to be for sensitive skin. Olay's Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid is the only product that has kept me from looking like I ran face-first into sandpaper. The only thing missing is a little SPF protection. If anyone can recommend an oil-based SPF moisturizer similar to this, I'd like to try it."
"I've been using oil of olay original beauty lotion (in the pink bottle) for more than 35 years,I am now in my middle 50's&(look like I'm in my late 30's) &I have the softest,smoothest,healthy looking skin.I will never use anything else&i don't care about all the stuff they try to sell you on t.v. or at expensive department store counters.I love ""oil of olay in the pink bottle.it is certainly a CLASSIC."
"I'm 50. I have used this since I was 14...I'ts the only one for me. The Product have been able to buy in any beautystore in Sweden all this years, but suddenly now it's inpossible to find. You can't even find it in internetshops in Sweden. Not in store, sold out, item has been discontinued...What's happened??? I'm desperate! Regards Miriam"
"I've been using original oil of olay hyderating lotion for many,many,many many years,I love how it makes my skin soft&smooth&with a nice glow&it has a great scent also.i'm 55yrs old,but I have a beautiful complexion.I hope they don't change or try to improve this wonderful. Original lotion,because its just wonderful the way it is.&they need to keep the original name""OIL OF OLAY""now its just ""olay"""
"I've been using oil of olay hydrating. Lotion(pink bottle) for nearly 32 years,I am 53 &it leaves my skin soooo soft,smooth,with a nice little glow,I am 53 &look 33.I don't wear sloth of make up,ol like the natural look,Also get a lot of compliments on. How young&gorgeous I look_(i even get carded at some night clubs)"
"I just turned 70 years old. I have used this product for at least 50 years. I have been told that I look the same as when I was 50 years old and my skin is beautiful. I attribute this to my use of oil of olay pink, as I call it. I was in Las Vegas recently and a salesperson was trying to sell my daughter cell replacement serum and she told me I did not need it!! What a compliment!! I wish I could attach a photo of my birthday picture."
"This lotion has been used by my great grandmother, my grandmother, my mother, my aunts, my cousins, myself and now my daughter My great grandmother was already in her 60s when she started to use Oil of Olay. My mother was in her early 20s and today does not look her age. I've tried other brands, some much more expensive, but the results were about the same. At 56, I am told my skin is in better condition than many 30 year olds. Thank-you Oil of Olay"
"It goes on & bam ur face it like brand u!! It helps your face feeling it just amazing, I mean a face like u thought before, smooth softer than u felt u days advance. I mean try it & see.how it u feel I never like saying before but ur face never get good!!"
"I love how this smells and feels great on my skin. A friend told me about it so I'm trying it out, but it hasn't been that long so I m waiting for results. Keep the size that you have but get a smaller size as well to keep with you, which really the size that you have isn't that big either. Thank you."
"Thank you Olay for making such an amazing product! I have a super sensitive skin and have tried everything for many years (yes almost all expensive and non-expensive brands) before I started using this beauty fluid - it works like magic on my skin. My mom started using this product since she was in Grade 6 and she hooked me to this product and I'm in love now. It smells great too! Please do NOT change the ingredients. One request: we need a travel size for this. Thank you, Olay - I'm in love!"
"I love this product and have used it for years. At age 65 I still get complements on my youthful skin. BUT I wish it came in a 3 ounces or less travel size! I travel for business dozens of times a year using only carry on luggage, and I have to pour the Olay into a smaller bottle to take it with me on the airplane (and it doesn't pour well). If the company reads these reviews, please consider making a 3 ounce size!"
"I've been using this product since I was 15 and it's the only one that works for my combination skin. I've tried several others over the years but there's always something that feels wrong about them - too oily, too thick, too heavy, too expensive, etc. I've always returned to the classic Oil of Olay, and have stopped trying other products. Now I'm 46 years old, and I can't say how many times I hear the comment, ""You never age!"""
I was introduced to this miracle cream by my mother when I was young and since then I've had periods where I've tried replacing it. Every time I failed. There simply isn't anything better! This beauty fluid is an addiction -for my skin and I'll admit I panicked when I stopped finding it in Sweden. Desperate I recently ordered it from abroad wondering if that's my new routine. The rumor is that this product was discontinued in Scandinavia but no one has been able to verify this. Is this true?
"My mother introduced Oil of Olay beauty fluid to me and my younger sister when we were young and the three of us have been using this product all our lives. Neither of us could ever think of using another product. Sadly it seems like the beauty fluid is no longer avalible in Sweden, where we live. Are you still producing this product? Where could we buy it, if not from Sweden?"
When I turned 16 my mother let me start wearing makeup and gave me a tube of mascara and bottle of Oil of Olay. It has been part of my daily routine ever since. Fast-forward 30 years and people NEVER guess my true age. When I say I'm 46 many times people don't believe me and insist on seeing my driver's license. I ALWAYS attribute it to this product and tell younger women I meet to start early with it. Inexpensive and it WORKS! I could easily be an ‘average person' spokeswoman for this product!
When I purchased this product it came two in a package. I thought I would have enough for a while. I tried using it twice but the scent is so terrible that I had to wash it off right away. I've used Olay for many years and always loved the product but very disappointed with this one not only because of the money I laid out but for the terrible smell. I wonder if there isn't something wrong with this batch.
I have used the original Olay Beauty Fluid since I was 12 years old. My mother used it every day and she would share here with me. I am now 49 years old and still use the same original lotion every day on my face and body! I am told I look like I am in my 30's and I truly believe I have Olay Beauty Fluid original to thank for it. Please don't ever change the scent or makeup of the product. It is fabulous!!!
"I have used this product daily for over 40 years. I have tried others when this became difficult to find in stores. Nothing is as light, nourishing and non greasy. I now order it online. Even as a sun worshiper in past years, my skin looks much younger than most my age."
"It's not too good of quality compared to other lotions that I've tried from clinique and neutrogena. The fragrance doesn't suit me, but that's just preference. I guess it does do the job and moisturize overnight, which is when I apply it (right after I've taken my shower). My primary dislike is that it feels heavy on my skin."
I've been using Oil of Olay Original since I was in my mid-teens. I'm 54 now. I have sensitive skin and this is the only lotion I can use without braking out into a rash. I put it on my face and hands every day. I couldn't find the original lotion in the store the other day and I almost cried. Please don't stop supplying this product to the stores.
"I use to use the Oil of Olay products for many, many years. Then the product came out with more fragrances and I could not use them as I am sensitive to them. I purchased this product yesterday, put it on my face today and had to remove it immediately, due to the smell. I'm taking it back later today or tomorrow and try to find another fragrance-free product by Olay."
"I have used Oil of Olay for 40 years and I have very few wrinkles. I have to use the SPF now because I had a little cancer on my nose about ten years ago,because of to much sun. But other than that my skin is in great shape especially for my age. My daughter who smokes's skin has more wrinkles than I have. Fay"
"I remember my mother using this when I was a child. Product is light and I love the smell. I started using it at age 16. Since turning 30 I have bumped up to the Total Effects line, but still occasionally go back to the old tried and true original. Hopefully my skin will look as good as my mother's when I am her age."
"I have been using the Original facial moisturizer since I was in my teenage years. I use it everyday, and honestly a lot of people tell me I do not look 51 years old. So that just tells you that it is a GREAT product. I will never stop using it. Thank you Olay"
"I have been using Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid Lotion - Original over 20 years. When I was working I was in & out of the weather often, my skin is very sensitive & this lotion kept my skin very soft and youthful. Many people I meet cannot believe my age. My skin feels moist all day, I wash my face at night & reapply the lotion at night. I love this lotion."
I have been using the Olay Active Hydrating Beauty Fluid Lotion every morning along with the Olay Age Defying Night Cream as was recommended to me on the Online Questionnaire. I have used it for the past 41/2 months(that is how long the jars lasted me) and I no longer suffer from dry skin and my wrinkles have either disappeared or decreased. I am 47 years old and for the first time I don't have facial dry skin and do look younger. Based on these products I highly recommend Olay.
"I have been using Oil of Olay's Hydrating Beauty Fluid for 35 years, since I was a teenager. I am starting to use other Oil of Olay products now. I get told regularly that I look like I could be a sister to my 3 daughters. It keeps my skin looking and feeling very young. I have tried other moisturizers once in a while, only to come back each time to Oil of Olay. This is the best."
My grandmother turned me on to Oil of Olay over 30 years ago and I have been using it everyday since. I love that it is not greasy and soaks into my skin. I'm NEVER without it. I always have a bottle in my purse and it goes where I go. Living in the desert you have to use some type of moisturizer and I am so thankful that grandma gave me this gift that I will always treasure. Thank you Oil of Olay!
"The classic pink beauty fluid was originally recommended by a dermatologist friend. After years of using this product, with forays in to other, more expensive and time-consuming skin care regimes, I find myself consistantly returning to Olay classic moisturizer. My skin feels and looks good with regular use, that's all I ask!!"
"This is the perfect everyday moisturizer for me - I am 23 and have dry, sensitive skin - Olay's beauty fluid feels great as it absorbs quickly and does not leave a heavy, greasy feel. I have noticed an improvement since using this product - in the depth of my expression lines. Will continue to purchase, thanks Olay!"
"My 83 year old grandmother used this product all my life. I began using it in my teens, because she was the youngest looking grandmother I knew. 2 strokes later, she's still the youngest looking 83 year old I know, and at almost 33 I still get carded for rated R movies. Non greasy for my oily skin, and doesn't break me out like most other Olay products I've tried. The original is still the best!"
"I love the original Olay fluid better than any other moisturizer they make, but wonder what happened to the Olay for Sensitive skin that DOESN'T have UV spf in it. I cannot find it anywhere, and have to use original Olay because I have a reaction to most things with any sort of sunscreen in it. This is a good substitute if you are not making it anymore, but please consider bringing it back. I know of at least 3 other ladies in my area that are looking for it and would love to be able to find it again."
I have tried many different facial products even different olay facial products but nothing has worked like this product. My skin is very sensitive and this product works amazingly. Skin is silky soft now. I would recommend this product to anyone with even sensitive skin.
"Grew up using Oil of Ulan which transpired into Olay. This is the only skin care I have used and grade it excellent however I purchased a pottle of Olay in the USA in April and the smell is slightly ""old motel wet synthetic carpet"" Returned to NZ and purchased Olay Complete, made in Thailand and the mild perfume is so much more acceptable. Why? Lived in USA for many years and only now after returning to NZ notice the difference. (Still have the US container)"
"I have used this product for 40 years, religiously, everyday. I would not think of putting any other cream or mosturizer on my face. I have not even used a sunscreen, relying successfully on the SPF protection in this product. Comparatively speaking, my skin is younger looking than most women my age or even younger. I need only minimal make-up to achieve my everyday look. Thank you Oil of Olay!!!"
"I have been using your ACTIVE HYDRATING BEAUTY FLUID -ORIGINAL for 20 years and recommended it to everyone. My two daughters have been using it since high school, about 8 years. My husband uses it too. It is a perfect product. No irritants, no residue and mild for all skin types. We love it!"
What happened? This product was amazing and smelled great and felt great. NOW it is really not good. Please go back to old formula. The new formula is sticky and smells bad
Why would you change a perfect product? The new formula is horrible & the new smell is disgusting. Are you even listening to your customers? Do you care?
"Have used this as a loyal customer for years, just like my mum. Loved it, loved the scent. Hate the smell of the new product. Now I have to find another, good work clever marketing folk. Were you not selling enough?"
"Been useing this for two years now. Absolutely love this works great, smells wonderfull, and does not feel sticky or greasy at all.and sold at a amazing price. Highly recommended for you to RUN and start useing."
I had very bad dry skin from the cold weather and cold air and my face was basically chapped. The product took it away in less than 2 days. I even tried a rx my Dr gave me and it didn't work this good.
I've been using this product for many many years I wash my face with dove than use oil of Olay nobody believes lm going to be 60 I look so much younger thanks to oil of Olay
I have been using Olay moisturizer for years but not only myself but my mother as well. The moisturizer feels like silk on my face and the smell is so wonderful and a comforting smell from my childhood.
I am a twenty-four year old with combination skin and I use this every morning after I cleanse. It's wonderful because it doesn't make my skin feel greasy in the oily parts and doesn't under-hydrate my dry cheeks. I enjoy this product...yes I do.
I am 32 and have been using Olay since I was 12. I have tried other brands that are more expensive and promise too much. I always come back. This does not clog pores and it's not greasy. I love it!!
I have been using this for years - my grandmother gave it to me when I was in high school and she noticed my dry skin. I love it! It is just right - not too greasy and not too light.
"Best product ever, i stopped using it for a month or two and had so much acne when i never ever had it. Then realized it istarted using it again and within weeks it is so clear and i love it! I am so happy with this product!"
I have used Olay since I was 17 and it shows. I have been told I don't look my age and I know why. 55 is beautiful and I will continue to use Olay its my little beauty secret that I love.
"Non-greasy, quickly absorbed and light. I've been using it for years and love it."
Love this non greasy lotion. I just wish it came in a travel size so that I could use it when I travel with just carry on luggage.
"This hydrating fluid is perfect for my dry skin, and it's totally non-greasy and really absorbs into the skin. Not expensive at all. Thank you Olay!"
Have been using this product for 30 years now and when I tell people my age they can't believe it just love Olay!
"This is an excellent product for beginners. It is very moisturizing, but not greasy at all. I just wish it contained a high SPF."
I have been using this product every day for 46 years. My mother had always used it so as a teenager I began using it and LOVE IT ! ! !
"incredible results, something about it has been changed over the years, doesn't work as well anymore. My mother who is now 58 swore by it."
I can remember my grandmother using it! She made me a believer! I am 40 and no wrinkles so far!! Look forward to using it every night.
I tried several types of lotions and nothing has worked like this product has.
"The Scent is very fresh, I didn't experience any redness or irritation, with this product"
I would like to use on a regular vasis in the winter. And for my face to get the full effect.
I love how the product leaves my skin feeling. Soft and moisturized!
I tried everything but this is minimize my pores than anything else...!
"Used forever thru dryness, stress, hormones, & acne."
I have used the orginal beauty fluid for over 45 years and my skin is still soft and wrinkle free!
"Light, not greasy, absorbs easily, feels silky smooth"
"I use Olay than the expensive salon's, and very satisfied."
"Light, not greasy, absorbs easily, feels silky smooth"
