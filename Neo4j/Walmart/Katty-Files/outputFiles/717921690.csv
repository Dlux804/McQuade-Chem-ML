"RoC RETINOL CORREXION MAX Daily Hydration Anti-Wrinkle Creme is my new favorite skincare. I have been using it for several weeks and my skin is now much smoother and brighter. I have noticed some wrinkles are less noticeable. The only drawback is I have to use sunscreen during the day since this product contains retinol, otherwise my skin will get burnt easily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Since using this product for 3 weeks now I have noticed a significant difference in how soft and supple my skin has become. My husband even commented on how much firmer my skin looked and the difference in the deep wrinkles I had on my forehead, around my eyes and nose and mouth! I will continue using this product and get rid of all the other hydration and anti wrinkle I have been using!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This is one of the few that actually works. I've used everything, even those costing $150 a jar. This is better. Serious. I use it daily. Can see a big difference in my face."
I really liked how quickly the product started to show results. It's only been a couple of weeks but I can't wait to see if it keeps working and improves or if this is as good as it gets. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this two months. I really like it my skin feels healthier and i think looks somehwat better. It will not take away the wrinkles. Prob only botox will do that. They do look a little diminshed. Wish it did take them away!

No redness or burning as I thought might happen after reading about it. I apply once a day and it worked. I will try more Roc products now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like the Roc Retinol Correxion Anti-wrinkle cream, I like that it is fragrance free and how smooth it feels on your skin. I like that it doesn't leave an oily film on my face after I use it and after rubbing it in, it dries really fast. I don't even know I have it on. I can see a little difference in the wrinkle around my eyes, but they are not all gone. Hopefully after using it longer, there will be even less. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I thought that the RoC Retinol Correxion Max Daily Hydration Anti-Wrinkly Creme, Fragrance-Free worked well. I saw noticeable improvement for my fine lines and wrinkles. I didn't like that I needed to wear an extra SPF 15 or higher. It made me concerned about the overall health of my skin using just the product alone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this very rich non-fragrance cream. The texture is wonderful and it would be so easy to slather too much on my face as it feels incredible. I see a difference already in my face as my wrinkles are less noticeable. Nice that I got to try a product to see how I liked it before buying. I will be having this in my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This product was amazing from the start! I carefully read the package directions, and tried the creme. I thought it would make my skin break out, but it didn't. Our weather has been perfect for testing because of very low humidity. My face and neck are so moisturized, and the fine lines are disappearing. The label says that in time, the deeper lines will be less noticeable, and I can't wait! Amazing product, RoC! I'm a fan! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have not noticed any change in my skin from the creme. I did not like the smell of the creme also it felt like my skin was being burnt from it. I did not notice any irritation from the product it just burnt after applying. I have not noticed any change in my complexion. I will use the product for 2 more weeks as it was recommended for 30 days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin is very sensitive and most items like this dry my skin horribly. This cream has not irritated my skin at all. I started out using it every other day to let my skin get used to it. I am now using it every day. I have noticed my skin looking less dry and wrinkled and age spots have started slowly fading. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the RoC Retinol Correxion Max a lot and I definitely felt as though it made my fine lines less noticeable and my skin more hydrated. It did make me break out a little, but I believe it is because Retinol helps to clear acne as well, but first it pulls it up before clearing it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really liked the way it felt on my skin. I liked that it was fragrance-free. I felt my skin felt smoother in the morning. It worked well with my foundation.

I do not have sensitive skin but i have never used a Retinol product before so maybe it works for others but it seems i cant use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am a huge skeptic of face care products but RoC Retinol Correxion made an impression. Unlike most creams that are out there it did NOT leave a greasy, oily and sticky feeling on my face. It absorbed quickly and made my skin feel like silk. One thing I did notice is that when it said fragrance free it was exactly that, no overpowering smell. My skin is loving this cream and it is a product I will buy and continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This retinol cream has a nice texture and I like the way it feels on my skin. It does hydrate, but I had to be careful and only use a small amount on my face because it would make my eye area a little sensitive and red. Overall I think it works really well and your skin just has to adjust over time. I will probably buy this in the near future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love that it moisturizes quickly and leaves no greasy residue. I feel my finger lines are less visible, and I have a more youthful look all together.

It has only been a week since trying this cream but I've had no issues thus far - I like the thick consistency and it is more hydrating than my other return A products.

"Living in a semi-arid climate is no joke on your skin! I get to this point of the year and my face is parched. I drink a gallon of water a day (which helps) but can't seem to find a product that moisturized without feeling heavy and pore clogging by the end of the day. So happy to have found RoC! It goes on so smoothly, and the hydration lasts all day. This is a new staple in my daily routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am 47 and notice fine lines around my mouth and eyes that had started becoming deeper. I had tried several other things but I do not like the fragrance and they always feel hot on my face during the. I have been able to use the RoC every morning and night for the last week without the flushed feelings during the day. Even better I have noticed a softening of the lines and a brightness in my complexion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This has become my new wrinkle correction cream. It is working on removing some dead layers of skin while it hydrate it. I like he texture and consistency. At first try I can feel a slight ‚Äústingy‚Äù sensation when I first used it. Some areas of skin seem to flake off. I am 50 years young and seeing a difference in the fine line I do have. Depending on your age and skin type you will get different results. I'm happy with the results I'm seeing definitely!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
