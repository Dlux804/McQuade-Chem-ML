"I have bought this multiple times in the last year and it is great on my sensitive skin. I've used to for sunburn, working out, and long summer drives when the sun is awful. It's always came through and helped."
"I bought this in june and i have loved it so much! The nozzle spray is so amazing, conoared to the illuminating facial primer (the nozzle is too strong). This cool down spray has a nice scent as well, nothing too strong. I in fact have sensitive skin around my mouth and nose area and this hasnt made it sting so thats great. Last week i forgot to bring it to the gym and my face was so sweaty and red after i was done. Using this is supper essential because it actually does cool down. Will be buying more once i am out :D"
"I read the reviews before purchasing it because I needed a new one. I love it! It smells great and NO it's not overpowering or leaves my face smelling like Febreeze lol. It has a light fresh scent, a fine mist and it really does set my makeup amazingly. I work out and lift weights and I do sweat a lot, after patting my sweat off multiple times and showering my makeup is still in place and doesn't separate at all or look greasy. I'm happy I purchased this spray!"
"I'll admit I was hesitant to buy this because of people's unhappiness with the smell, but I really want to buy it deep down when I had gotten my gym membership a month ago. I'm glad I got this. I love the smell! Yeah, it does smell like Febreeze, but it's actually very light. It does cool down a bit, and helps get rid of some if that post workout funk I get. It does its job well, and it'll totally buy it again."
I spray before and after workout or after a sweaty day. Keeps my skin fresh without having to wash! I prefer to splash off with some cold water if I am near a sink and then dab off before spraying post workout.
"I use this stuff all the time, at the gym but also just on days that are hot and sweaty. It has a great refreshing smell and feels nice and soothing on the skin. It has a nice fine mist so it doesn't just spray giant blobs on your face and it's a little moisturizing too."
"I'm not crazy about the smell, but it's a nice refreshing mist after a workout and you're feeling hot and sweaty."
"This product I could take or leave. I used it as a Setting Spray (after using the other products in the line) and it didn't seem to make my makeup stay better nor did it make it melt off. The smell is like Bath and Body Works Cotton lotion, and I like it, but some may not. I used it after my workout and still felt exhausted and sweaty, not really cooled down and refreshed."
"So in a nut shell this has the SAME ingredients as the beauty sheild mist (they did the same for the hydration stick and the prep & hydrate stick). They did intenseify the fragrance to make it smell clean, but it's easily over powering. One pro is the mist fine and better then the beauty shield mist."
"don't over spray , you'll be coughing and have the perfume taste on your lips and you'll look overly sweaty. doesn't cool me down , just wets my face without me splashing water . it's okay I bought 2."
"I got this as a gift and was so excited to try it out, but was disappointed. The scent is incredibly strong, and smells like febreeze, and if you have sensitive skin this might not be for you, as the perfume smell in the spray irritated my skin."
I bought this about 3 months ago and I fell in love with it. it's great for my sensitive skin
"I use this after working out at my local rec center. I also used this after the mile at my school. It felt really good. It has a cooling affect on the skin. I use this on my face, arms, and legs. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because of the smell. It has a fresh cotton smell that I don't mind. But other people with sensitive smell around me might not. The other reason is doesn't have 5 stars for me is because after I use this product it leaves a sticky feeling on my leg. Overall, this product is pretty good!"
Smells great and it really works the bottle looks really nice too
