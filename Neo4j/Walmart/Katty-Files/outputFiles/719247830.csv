I been using cream 3 weeks. I have many dark spot from estrogen patch.this product is tarting to lighten them.there is no smell.and the hyaluronic acid and vitamin e keep skin moisture.so it is non drying like some of the other bleaching creams can be.
"Great spot corrector. I oroginally purchased for my mothers age spot amd tried it for my acne dark spots and after a week i notice great changes in how light they were getting. I tried many creams, but this one is the best and i will keep purchasing it"
"This product does what it says it does. The cream can be used on the face, body and hands. You can tell when you use it that it is high quality. I really like how it lightens dark spots and helps your skin to appear brighter. It contains healthy ingredients so help your skin feel alive and beautiful. I highly recommend this lightening cream."
It has been 7 days since I started using this wonderful product. I am almost age 75 and I had dark spots on both sides of my face. The dark spots have faded to a much lighter color already. Very happy with this product. It does what is advertised.
"I'm on my 19th day. My age spot is fading, a little bit left, but I can see that it is clearing. I used it under my sun block when working in the garden. I have a very sensitive skin. I'm glad that it is working for me. My face is also soft. I was scared to use it in the beginning. I am recommending it. Read instructions carefully. Use sun block outdoor. I really love it."
I have been using this product for 3weeks now and I noticed difference. I had several sun spots on my face and all of them faded. Also i have very sensitive skin but no reaction from this cream. Very gentle and light weighed. I love this cream. I would like to recommend this cream to anyone. Thanks for making awesome product!
Have been using this product for a short time and can see results already!! Dark spots on face are showing signs of fading. Cream is easy to use and does not leave any residue on application site. So far very satisfied and would recomend this product to my friends.
I ordered the dark Sport corrector cream a few weeks back. It's working for me. I have noticed that the dark spots on my skin is gradually fading off. I will always recommend the product as it is so effective
"I haven't had it long, but it hasn't done a thing. I'm old, but it seems to have a drying effect on my face. I guess you need moisturizer. I will continue using it on my hands. Maybe it needs more time."
"This was a total waste of money! I used this cream for over 6 weeks faithfully and i did not see any changes whatsoever. My sunspots and dark spots are still there, this cream is a total dissapointment! DO NOT BUY IT!!! It doea not work. I give it 0 stars."
My wife and I apply on the Dark Spot on Face every night before sleep that makes clean Dark Spot very slowly. But sure this cream is working. Some of the Dark Spot Completely disappears.
"Iâve been using this cream since July 1,2019 , twice a day and it seems like my dark spots are getting worse."
"I used this to help with early dark spots on my arms. It works great! The spots lightened to almost nothing (unless you reallllllllly look) in 3 weeks. You can use it all over, which I think is great."
Whitening Labs Dark Spot Corrector does EXACTLY what it says it will do. Dark spots on face have already lightened and face appears brighter after use. Great on my hands. They wonderful after use. This is a great buy and I would recommend.
Dark Spot Corretor Cream is an amazing cream that gives the skin a radiant look. It is a nice corrector cream that removes dark spot and gives smooth look.
"I started using this cream from the one my friend purchased when I visited her and I found out that within 9 days, the dark spots on my face was fading out and I immediately ordered mine so I can continue without a break. I really love it."
Nope.....I have a couple of age spots on my face I been using this cream daily for four weeks. (Sorry no Pics couldn't get them to upload) Not even a slight improvement. I would not recommend this product.
"I have almost finish my first jar and my spots are 70% lighter, I am an Actor and needed a face worth a $1,00.000 to book those jobs and whitening lab is my partner, we are a great team and for $19.98 to do what it does, try to go and see a movie and candy I could of bought an other jar, also Walmart had it out to me in 2 days I will go for a 2nd cause the spots were many and dark,"
"What can i say about this creamððIm in love with it ,i have only been using it for 2 weeks in a row.My skin is on another level already ,the dark circles under my eyes have improved drastically .The acne spots on my chest are fading as well .I am impressed !!!!Will be purchasing again soonð"
"I'm thankful for this product because it is not often we find an all around product especially if its beauty related! It comes with natural ingredients that does nothing but bring effective results. Spots in my face and hands are diminishing! I don't have to use two products to treat those spots! And, my skin is so soft and supple! This will be my staple product."
It is a thick and creamy cream. It spreads quickly and easily. You don't nerd to use much at all. It leaves my skin soft and smooth
I have scarring and marks on my hands and face. I searched for a while for a product like this one to even out my completion.
"It glads on with easy none grease, my skin looks brighter."
Great product! You must try it!
The jury is still out. It is too early to tell if this product works

"This worked really surprisingly well. I've tried more expensive products without much result, but this one gave me what I wanted just after a few weeks of regular use."
