"I decided to try this tone correcting moisturizer to see if it would help me with my uneven skin tone and somewhat light darker spots on my face. After using this product for a month, I have noticed a difference in my face tone. I love it. I actually used it alone yesterday without my regular foundation. I notified my face looked very natural and and seemed to be glowing. I will continue to use this product and will try the tone correction eye cream next. Best face cream ever!!"
I've been using total effects cc tone correcting medium to deep for years. It gives my face a tan color for summer . I can't find that color anywhere! Is it discontinued ? I hope not!
I usually buy a separate moisturizer with SPF 15 and then a liquid makeup. I decided to try this because I had a coupon. I was a little worried about coverage. I have used it for a month. I am 61 and I really like it! My face doesn't look as 'made up'. It looks more natural. I do use a concealer or a liquid makeup on any blemishes.
"With combination skin and dry spots, it's been difficult finding the right moisturizer. I have used Olay products throughout the years and decided to drop my expensive moisturizer and try them again. I'm glad I did! It does have a thick consistency but doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky. I use a mineral foundation which works with it well since I just apply it to my t-zone. I would definitely recommend you try it if you have mature skin"
"I love Olay skin care products and have been using them for years. I recently tried this product since I wanted a tinted moisturizer with sunscreen and love other products in the Total Effects line (it's my favorite). However, I may be taking this one back to the store. It makes my face look really oily. I keep blotting hoping to make it less shiney, but the glow doesn't go away. Really wish Olay would reduce the ""luminosity"" or make this available without it."
"I loved this product but have had an extremely difficult time finding the medium to deep shade which I used all summer. Bring it back, please."
Will not use. No light shade for fair skin. I have discontinued supporting OLAY and so have others I know in the cosmetology field.
"It leaves my skin looking healthy and hydrated. The coverage is good enough for me to use everyday with a light dusting of mineral powder. The color looked light in the bottle, but was perfect for my skin tone. It's replaced my foundation completely."
"I had just recently started using CC cream. I use it as my foundation on most days. I love it. I recommended to my best friend she loves it too!!! I no longer use a moisturizer during the day this covers all the bases :) I do put a powder over it to set my makeup like blush and it tends to get a little greasy feeling by end of day, but overall this stuff is freaking awesome :) Thank you! I do use other products by Olay but now I think my skin care line is going to be all Olay :)"
"Fair Light no longer available. So disappointed. No longer buying this product as my color has been discontinued. Hoping I can find another brand I like as well to replace it. Would recommend this product to a light medium shopper. Unfortunately, not for me."
"I have always had good skin but it is beginning to show some age now that I am 60. I love that this moisturizer doesn't settle in my wrinkles, looks natural, and includes the spf. I have very sensitive skin and can use this even close to my eyes. I've bought many other far more expensive tinted moisturizers and this is by far my favorite. I will say that I think Olay has reformulated it as it does not seem as creamy as it was before which I do miss."
I love this tinted moisturizer but after having a malanoma on my face that had to be removed I need more than spf 15.
I have used Olay Total Effects 7 Tone Correcting Moisturizer for many years. Very disappointed like many that the fair to light shade has been discontinued. Light to Medium does not look good on me!
You need to bring back the fair to Light shade it was perfect for my skin! This medium to fair shade is awful! It is thick and cakes in your fine line & the it turns your skin orange. It is Awful!! Very unhappy :(
"I was excited to buy this product, having seen & heard so much about it. What a disappointment! The light to medium color provides no color/tone correction whatsoever and feels a little oily. Considering how expensive it is, I expected a better product. I will go back to my previous product, a BB cream that is less costly and works beautifully."
"I have used Olay Total Effects 7 Tone Correcting Moisturizer for many years. Very disappointed that the fair to light shade has been discontinued. Light to Medium does not look good on me, I have to mix it with a very light base just to get the color I need."
"I love this product, but the Light to Medium is too dark for me. It goes on beautifully, feels good on my skin, and it doesn't accentuate lines and wrinkles, but it looks completely unnatural because of the tint. I don't understand why you would limit your market for an otherwise great product this way."
"This is an amazing cream: never cakey,not too thick,and really makes you look younger.In the past,I applied a fair-light option for winter and a light-to-medium option for summer.A fair-light tone cannot be found for sale anywhere now,therefore I use only a light-to-medium tone, which is still a little bit too orange for me.If OLAY creates this cream with a yellow undertone,I will be a very loyal buyer.Please don't drop this product - make it better by offering different shades.Thank you."
"This product is fantastic but the light-medium is far too dark for light skinned people like me. And I'm not even fair skinned! PLEASE, PLEASE bring back FAIR-LIGHT version. I've been able to buy it imported so it's clear that you still make it for other countries. Why not the USA? I gave only a couple stars because of this. Such a great product, please let lighter skinned people in the USA buy it too. Thanks"
"bring back your bb creams with out a scent, this was light great coverage and felt good on skin, I have used your products for 30 years and now I am left with the new whipped moisturizer, love them but perhaps you could tint the whipped, like your bb cream colors...light and medium selection, the cc products are too heavy!"
I have to agree with many of the reviewers here. I just bought this product in light to medium as that is all the store had. The shade is way too dark for me. I would love to try the lighter shade that is no longer offered. I will be returning this product back to the store.
"If they restore fair to light, I am thrilled. Have used this color for years, and when I ran out I purchased light to medium because that was all that was available. What a difference. Way too dark for my complexion. Looks fake and artificial on me. Fair to light was perfect. Please restore this color!"
"This is too dark for my winter (white) skin. It looks like fake tanner. While the product is great - skin nourishing and medium coverage - I cannot wear it until summer when/if I tan. PLEASE offer this product in Fair to Light, the same tone as your Olay Total Effects 7 in one CC cream."
This web page still shows the Fair to Light color choice but it is not available anywhere! I used it for years then it disappeared. Light to Medium color is just to dark and orange-y for my fair skin. I really miss this wonderful product...I haven't been able to find anything else that I really like since this went off the market. Please!!! Bring back the Fair to Light.
"I've been using this product for a couple of years and absolutely loved it: the Fair to Light was a perfect match to my skin tone. BUT I am extremely disappointed that it is now only available in Light to Medium. I put the ""fair"" on one side of my face and the ""medium"" on the other: my husband could tell the difference and preferred the ""fair"" side. WHY DON'T YOU BRING BACK SHADE CHOICES? One size does not fill all!"
"I love love love the way this product makes my skin feel, but the ligh/medium is way too light for me. I thought during the winter with no tan it would work but it doesn't. Would love to see this in a medium shade. For now I have to put the color from another company's products over it"
"I have used this product for years in the medium to deep shade. It was a perfect fit for me. My daily regimen includes an antioxidant serum, followed by Elta MD sunscreen (dermatologist orders). I would top it off with the med to deep tone corrector and it gave me a perfect coverage with the feel of heavy foundations. I cannot use the lighter color as it makes me look like a ghost. I am so disappoint the Olay has decided everyone has the same skin color."
"love all olay products but this product is NO GOOD! Its too dark and orange. Seems like there's only 1 shade. CC creams apply nicely. however, its NOT SWEAT/WATER PROOF. CC cream comes off instantly in hot weather. not sure if really covers all the effects as advertised."
"I used to love this product but since the FAIR shade was discontinued I can no longer use it. I tried the Fair to Medium shade but it is way too dark for me and doesn't blend in with my complexion. If the fair shade was available again, I would gladly switch back to it. For anyone else who is having the same problem, I am trying Simply Age Less 3-in-1 liquid foundation (Covergirl + Olay). There is a great selection of shades and so far it looks good."
"I have been using this for years. The Light to Medium shade is too orange and dark for me and makes me look like I'm wearing a mask. I'm in mourning I cant use it any more. Please bring back the fair to light shade!!!! Think about it, people with fair skin are the ones wanting the sunscreen protection, not the medium shade ladies."
"I bought this because I couldn't find the fair to light shade and needless to say, I'll be returning it. It's a bit too orangey for me and although they have another similar product in that shade, it doesn't have sunscreen, so I'll need to look for something else as well I guess. It will probably work well for someone who is more warm toned and more on the medium side than light."
"I'm amazed that Olay hasn't responded to the many, many of us who need a different shade than the only one you carry now: Light to Medium (which isn't very light and too orangey for my skin tone!). I have resorted to Cover Girl + Olay ""Simply Ageless"" liquid. Quite a different texture, but at least I can find a shade that works and (presumably) it has some Olay in it. PLEASE PLEASE bring back the fair to light shade so many of us desperately need!"
I have used Olay products for many years. I decided to try this instead of my usual Olay moisturizer. I am very disappointed. It feels very dry and the color in not a tint but more like a foundation. My skin looked orange like a self tanning product. I will go back to the moisturizer I used before because this product is not at all what I expected from Olay.
"You need to bring back fair to light! The light to medium does not work for me and I have never found anything that was as good. Judging by the number of comments, Olay was very foolish to discontinue fair to light (as well as medium to dark). BRING IT BACK!!"
I absolutely love this product!!! BUT I need the med to dark tone and can't seem to find it anywhere lately!!!! I'm devistated! I don't wear foundation because I don't need the heavy coverage and this works perfectly for me. Can someone please tell me where to find it or if I can order it online!!!!
"I love this product! It works miracles on evening the tone of my skin. The only problem is they no longer carry all 3 shades. Only light to medium is offered. I need the fair to light but it's no longer available. Why?? The very people who need such skin protection- fair skinned- are no longer supported. I have to wear 2 shades darker than what I am to maintain the great skin coverage this product affords - frustrating and disappointing. Bring back fair to light shade , PLEASE!!!"
I have been using this product since it came our and recommending it to all my friends. It was my holy grail. My skin was smooth and luminous and it felt like silk going on. Then they discontinued the fair to light. The light to medium isn't even close to universal. It is several shades darker than my skin tone and looks horrible on me. Why stop a good thing. I am so disappointed. I would give this ten stars if they still had the fair to light.
"I love this product and have used it for years. I don't wear base and this product is perfect. The light to medium is a bit too dark for me. I can use it during the summer months, but not the rest of the year. Please bring back the the fair to light. There are other shades in the rainbow!"
"I love this product! It feels light & soothing to my skin. Evens out my skin tone yet looks sheer. No perfume odors, which as an allergy suffer I can't wear scented products. Recently, this has been hard to find in my area. I've been ordering online."
"This product is great. I have used it for several years and it provides just the right amount of coverage and color correction. I can't find the correct color on your site, however. Why? Where can I find ""medium to deep?"" ""Light to medium"" just won't work."
"The light to medium is too light for me and because of that I have been looking to other products of which so far I have not been happy with,Yet! Please save me from my search and bring back the medium to deep tone. I love the olay skin line and really do not want to have to keep wasting my time and money to find something else in it's place!"
"Been desperately looking for the ""fair to light"" shade and cannot find it anywhere. Please help...where can I find this shade? The light to medium is not my shade. Been using Olay moisturizer for 50 years and Total Effects tone correcting moisturizer since it came out. It is to to hot here to where anything else. HELP????"
Why did you quit making FAIR to LIGHT? It was one of very few tinted moisturizers that actually matched my skin tone. The Light to Med. is way too dark for me. I am so disappointed that you quit making the fair to light. I will have to find another product/brand that comes close and won't irritate my skin.
"I LOVED this product...please note the past tense...I don't use it anymore because you discontinued fair to light. Bring back fair to light and I'll be your customer again and give you five stars because it was the best product I've ever used. Until then, I have to go with a company that actually makes something to match my skin tone. BOTTOM LINE - No, I would not recommend this to a friend. The 3 choices are necessary, as people are NOT ALL in the middle of the color spectrum!"
"I LOVED this product...please note the past tense...I don't use it anymore because you discontinued fair to light. Bring back fair to light and I'll be your customer again and give you five stars because it was the best product I've ever used.

HATE that you have stopped making Fair to Light!!!!! Have used it since it first came out. Got my mom to use it as well. Love how light it is; provides coverage without being heavy. Do not like the now limited color selection. Too dark!!! Will have to start looking at products from other companies. :(
"I need medium to deep! I would think that Oil of Olay is forward-thinking and not backwards-thinking. People with different skin tones use your products. To stop making some colors but still sell the product is the company basically catering to only specific skin colors. Please listen to your customers and continue to make the various colors, especially medium to deep!"
"In the last few years my skin has become sensitive to foundations, I've tried different brands and formulas. This product meets all my needs. it's light yet gives me the coverage I need and does it without irritating my skin. It's the only tinted moisturizer I will ever use."
I was so disappointed when this summer I couldn't find my summertime color-ANYWHERE. I use light to medium most of the year but couldn't believe that summer was here and I couldn't find the darker shade. It finally dawned on me that maybe you weren't making it anymore. I love this product because it's so hard to find the perfect shade with conventional foundations and this really gives me just the right amount of coverage and blend.
I love this product but only gave it 1 star because the only color you offer now is Light to Medium. Fair to Light is the color I've used for years and now it's gone. I've already started using another brand and Olay has lost a 30 yr customer!!!! :-(
"This product is the BEST - Ive used it for many many years.... however, the last few months Ive been searching high and low for MY color, Ivory-light. I caved in and purchased Light-medium and it was WAY TOO dark for my fair skin. I'm really upset that Ivory may have been discontinued??? Anyone have a clue as to what happened??"
"I've been using this religiously for years because it doesn't exacerbate my rosacea and evens out my skin nicely. I can go without wearing anything else and look good - and I'm 52. But suddenly, medium to keep is nowhere to be found. I've been searching high and low and only see fair to medium online and in stores. What gives??? Is there a replacement coming or does Olay want it's customers to go elsewhere because by next week, that's what I'll be doing. Incredibly disappointed."
"This is now a part of my beauty ritual, I use it under my sheer make up. The color is nice and I am confident because I know that my skin is protected and nourished. It has a natural glow and it is not greasy, a good substitute for those who don't like to wear heavy make up. I love this product so much I hope that it won't be discontinued."
"I've used this product - in medium to deep - for the last 9 years and it's been an excellent cc cream. Love the moisture, SPF and light color so that I didn't need to use foundation. I used to buy it in packs of 2 - 3 because in the past couple of years it became very hard to find. Now I'm about out of my final one and I guess from reading reviews the medium to deep is now discontinued :( Super disappointed."
"I am a woman of color,I use by this CC moisturizer in deep. It was wonderful,I had to hoard it when I saw it on store shelves because it was very rare to find that shade. Now I can't even find it; not even on your website. I have been a consumer of Olay for 15 years, but now I have to look for other brands that have a wider shade spectrum than ""light to medium""' because the CC is too light and leaves my skin looking pale and ashy. You do know women of color do buy your brand?"
"I went to purchase this and some other Olay products and couldn't find any of them...CC Tone Correcting, Age Defying 2in1 Day Cream plus serum and Age Defying Eye Cream. These have been the only products I've found that work for me without any irritation."
I absolutely love my Total Effects 7 Tone corrector. My face has major sun damage and my face looks like the surface of Jupiter. My total effects covers most all my blemishes and looks natural. My only gripe is I have to mix it with more lotion to give it a smoother tone. The lotion evens it out. This can be applied to my entire face even under my eyes where i have horrible circles. Olay Total Effects gives me the confidence to go out and not feel self conscience. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought this product on a whim because it was on sale and I'm glad I did. The coverage is light and the product is mousse-y and airy, but provides a nice glow throughout the day. I have received lots of compliments since wearing this moisturizer. I don't wear makeup, so a tinted moisturizer works perfectly for me. Although it is a lighter shade than I usually wear, I find that it doesn't create a visible color line, only a warming glow. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is both a moisturizer and can be used instead of foundation. In addition to is smooth light texture, it minimizes pores. I've noticed smaller pores and smoother skin since using this product. Thank you Olay [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is perfect for mature skin,it's perfect for repairing skin problems,it's moisturizing & perfect for everyday use,helps with sagging skin as well!i love a product that does everything like this one!olay has been a favorite of mine for many years & i recommend to all! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
CC Cream - Total Effects Tone Correcting Moisturizer with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 Light-to-Medium is an awesome product I have been using it for years. I am 51 and my skin has some sun damage. This product seems to reverse the aging process. I love this product and would stick with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At the time I bought this product my eyes had dark circles and some puffiness, I know the soap is great so why not try the other products. I have been using total Effect Anti-Aging moisturizer for three months now, everyday and night before bed I use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I only wear light makeup, so this is perfect. I have had several minor surgeries for skin cancer, so wearing a sunscreen is a must. Also, I have a somewhat ruddy complexion, and the CC cream helps to give my skin a more even tone while adding moisture for our dry western air, and sunscreen for our sunny, hot days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the fact that this cream is able to cover the brown spots and uneven skin tone I have both from too much sun when I was young. I also have Lupus and redness from that. This coverup evens up my skin, it gives me a natural look without looking like I even have any lotion on at all. And of course, the sunscreen is a must for me now. This is one product I make sure not to run out of, since none of the others I've tried work as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried many different brands of tone correctors, but was was pleasantly surprised with this product. I had 2 large dark spots on my face, which made me feel very self conscious, but within 2 months of starting this product, THEY were gone. Use it with confidence. IT really does work! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoy this product. It has done wonders for my skin. I am a redhead with a very fair complexion. This work has worked on so many levels. Providing the moisturizer plus the sunscreen protection that also provides a tint to my skin giving me a glow. I have seen an tremendous change in my skin and will never use anything else. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for almost two years. It works, it moisturizes and protects and evens out the skin tone at the same time. I have received many compliments about how radiant my skin is, and how young it looks. I also like that it doesn't make it oily, like some other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the feel of the cc cream, but it was a bit heavier coverage than I expected. Using a damp makeup sponge helped resolve that, but not sure if I'm getting the full effect of the moisturizer by doing that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This amazing moisturizer is wonderful on my 68 year old skin. It minimizes the look of wrinkles and sun discolorations and helps to repair the damage done over many years. My skin looks smoother and the light coverage never collects in the wrinkles around my eyes . I would not think of leaving the house without it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the clean feel to this product . I have used others that are much more expensive , This has an even tone and you don't even know you have it on while protecting your skin with a natural glow . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used to use an expensive Mary Kay foundation, which was too heavy for my skin. I don't usually use a foundation, but because I am fair skinned and have uneven freckles, I tried this product. I love the results as it gives my face a more even tone. I also love the fact that it has SPF 15 in it as I need to use a product with sun block every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"CC cream is great for everyday use and it's perfect, because it has everything you need: it moisturizes, evens out your skin tone, it's like having foundation so no need for make up and it has sunblock! All in one bottle! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the Total Effects Line of Moisturizer -- my favorite, so far, is the CC Cream - Total Effects Tone Correcting Moisturizer w Sunscreen -- love the coverage w the light foundation -- feels light and covers well -- no need for more makeup OR sunscreen -- one step and I am done! LOVE it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this CC cream. I had been on a hunt for a CC cream that did not leave my skin super oily. I decided to give this a chance and I am glade I did. It gives the perfect amount of coverage and leaves skin looking very glowy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this moisturizer. It feels amazing after I put it on. My skin feels so smooth and soft. I love the color it adds to my face. It evens my skin tone and I feel comfortable going without ""foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product very much it goes on smooth and it covers blemishes so well that you don't have to use foundation so you get it all in one bottle it is one of the best products on the market I totally love all of the olay product line thank you olay [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Never before have I found a make-up that is so easy to apply and looks good, looks natural and covers well. I am very near sighted so I was hard to apply make up evenly with my nose up to the mirror. This is no longer a problem. Since I've had cataract surgery I have to stand back from the mirror and it still looks great with no application mishaps. Thank you Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this product! My skins feels and looks younger. I went to my 50th High School Reunion last week and several people told me how young I looked, but specifically that my skin was radiant-wow- RADIANT! Cool! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this one-step Olay moisturizer because it provides a little bit of color, moisture and sunscreen all at the same time! I am 50 years old and have used Olay since I was a teenager. My skin looks fabulous. Thank you Olay - No Plastic Surgery for Me!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I love the way Total Effects Tone Correcting Moisturizer with SPF 15 Light-to- Medium Cream Works on my sensitive Skin type. I also like the fact that I can get all my products in one and it takes have the time to get ready in the morning. It really works well on my skin type better than any other product that I have tried. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After 2 kids and working night shift I didn't think I'd ever see my skin look healthy again, but after using this time corrector moisturizer my skin looks the best it ever has!! The dark circles are gone and I have a year round glow that I get compliments on everyday. This by far is my best choice in skincare. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This foundation has it all! Mosturize your skin to eliminate dryness or oily skin. At the same time you are protecting your face from sun damage that can be harmful and cause premature wrinkle lines. On top of that you are applying a thin veil of foundation that evens out any redness or blotches. The icing on the cake for me is the fragrance free since I am sensitive to anything fragrant [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Many women don't want a heavy made up look as we age, preferring a healthy glow. This shade blends perfectly and provides light coverage without a harsh appearance. My skin feels moist all day long and looks fresh and clean. Perfect every day choice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product's lightweight coverage which moisturizes and evens out my skin tone. It feels as if I have nothing on my face yet makes my skin look fantastic! I would recommend this product to anyone who hates the heavy feel of foundation but wants light coverage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this produce for two weeks and I really like it. It is too soon to know if it will really reduce my wrinkles or firm my skin very much, but the first time I applied it, it made me look better. It is a little bit like makeup, only more natural looking. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product can be used as a sunscreen only or as a sunscreen/moisturizer. It evens skin tone and helps correct tiny lines and wrinkles. I love this product and would recommend it to anyone in their 40's or any other age!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use this product everyday as a moisturizer, sunscreen , foundation- it's like one stop shopping! You don't need 3-4 different products & containers- it's an All in one. And in our busy lives who doesn't like convenience? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought this to help correct the tone of my skin and got a lot more. The moisturizer is super smooth going on and makes my skin feel amazing. Having it include a broad spectrum sunscreen is just the icing on the cake. I have recommended it to all my friends. It is truly an amazing product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Total Effects Tone Correcting with Sunscreen Broad Spectrum SPF 15 light to medium. This is my favorite product my skin is evenly toned and as smooth as silk. I get many compliments for some one who is 63.. I use this twice a day morning and evening. Could't do without it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Just started to use this tone correcting moisturizer with sunscreen. The tint seems perfect if do not like to wear makeup in the summer. It applies very smooth and even. Nice coverage for uneven tone, age spots and dull skin. Hope overtime to help diminish age spots and recapture youthful luminosity. In addition, contains Broad Spectrum SPF15 in which I combine with a SPF30. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After I cleanse with Regenerist Luminous Cleanser, I use the Regenerist Luminous Moisturizer, and then follow that with Total Effects Tone Correcting Moisturizer because I like the slight tint and especially the SPF protection. It also has a very smooth feel--definitely not greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay CC moisturizer for several years. It not only moisturizes but has a slight tint which covers minor blemishes and its also a sunscreen. How can you beat that! I'm 82 years old and still get compliments on my complexion. Thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use this every day, and this product is fabulous! You get everything you need to get through your morning routine and out the door quickly - a moisturizer, a sunscreen AND a light tone corrector for those who don't want to wear heavy make-up! I just love this - and so will you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is all you need. Moisturizer with just enough coverage but not heavy looking or feeling with a sunscreen too. It feels light..coverage is just enough and no streaks or flakes like some foundations. Perfect for everday wear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product instead of foundation for about 2 years....I will never use foundation again! I like the way that this product works....it provides good coverage, and the moisturizer and sunscreen make it an absolute win-win! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. I cleanse with Regenerist cream cleanser, treat with Regenerist micro sculpting serum and than I use my secret weapon - Total Effects CC Cream. I don't use foundation or sun screen, the CC cream does it all! And my skin loves it - thank you, Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love Total Effects tone correcting moisturizer cream.Its the only thing I have found that truly make a difference to my skin.With the sunscreen built in I don't have to worry about applying extra on my face.One cream for all my needs...Thanks Olay [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have tried other Total Effects products, and enjoyed them. I cannot say the same for this CC cream. I have very dry/sensitive skin and this cream held on to my dry areas, creating very dry and flaky skin. I also did not like the pigmentation, it was very streaky and watery, making it impossible to go without make up because of the uneven color. I would not recommend this product to drier skin types. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Why do you not offer more shades? This “light-medium” color is way too dark for fair skins!
Why did you discontinue fair to light shade????? i can't use this anymore. I had to switch brands.
I wore this product for years in the fair to light color and I've been searching fruitlessly for a replacement product since it was discontinued. The light to medium is way too dark for me.
"I love this product, but need the medium to deep. The light to medium is to light for me. Will you be offering the medium to deep? Please let me know so I can order."
Completely miss the Fair to Light. I love the product but need the lighter shade. Why would you get rid of it? There are many fair skin people like myself. At least should be able to order it online or something!
"I agree with other reviewers one color does not fit all. Used the Medium to Deep and it was perfect. Light to Medium does not work for me and I love this product....Would not recommend due to ""one size fits all."""
I have been using this product for 7 years and all of the sudden I cant find fair to light anywhere. Its so unfair to fair skinned people and such a disappointment
"I used this product for many years, why Olay discontinued fair to light??? Please bring it back, It was my favorite, light to medium is too dark and orange for my skin, will never buy it again, very disappointed..."
I loved this product and used it as my foundation until the company decided every body is the same color. Why? Can not use this product any more because it doesn't match my skin tone. Too bad!!!
I've been using this product for about 3 years now. Realizing that the latest version is dark and orange. No longer works for me :( Wish the lighter shade was available. The formula works so well for my skin.

This product is legendary in the beauty industry. The best product with the best value and I relied on it for years. Please bring back the Fair To Light shade. Very disappointed in Olay for discontinuing an extremely popular product.
The light to medium is too dark for my skin. I cannot find fair to light. Will you please produce it again? I will not buy the light to medium again--it is too dark. This is a great product and one that really works with older skin.
This product goes on so smoothly and I love that it is tone correcting. It is like light makeup and does not clog pores. However I cannot find the Fair to Light shade and light to medium is too dark. Where can I find Fair to light?
I came to the Olay website to order the cc cream in the Fair to Light shade. I am disappointed to see it is not available. The Light to Medium is too dark for me. I am sorry to have to change brands.

"I, like others, am disappointed that Olay has discontinued making this product in Fair to Light. I use it daily and I'm sorry that when my current tube is depleted I won't be able to replace it. Why does Olay want to lose customers this way?"
Went to the website looking for Fair to Light. Wow! Why did you get rid of it? I would NOT buy the darker colors as I did once and it sat in my drawer after two tries til I finally threw it out--what a waste.
"Why would you discontinue the Fair to Light shade? The Light to Medium not only has a drier, thicker consistency but also has an awful orange cast. Please bring back the discontinued shade."
"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!! Bring back the Fair to Light shade. We need this product! It was perfect for the fair skinned - we NEED IT! Why would you discontinue it??"
PLEASE bring back Fair to Light!! I LOVE this product. There is nothing else in the market that compares. I tried Light to Medium but it's much too dark for my skin. Why has this been discontinued?
"I love this product--use it daily instead of heavy foundation. But my skin is very fair, and the Fair to Medium shade doesn't look right. Why have you stopped making Fair to Light? Please, please bring it back!"
"While I'm sure women of all ages love this product, older skin loves how it evened out skin tone and gave a healthy glow. The light to medium shade is just dark enough to make it look like I'm wearing the wrong color of a liquid makeup."
I used this product for years and enjoyed its lightness yet color correction coverage. Please bring it back in all the shades so everyone can still enjoy its benefits!
I love this product and have been using it for years....but what happened to my shade?? Cannot find medium to deep anywhere. Please bring it back!! Why would you stop making several shades?
Love this cc cream and was so disappointed to discover the fair shade has been discontinued...please Bring it back! Light to medium is too dark for fair skin colors.
"As a dedicated former user of the fair to light shade, I sadly must find something else now, as well. The light to medium is too dark and orange-ish for my skin and I disappointingly returned it. Someone in Olay marketing made a big mistake."
PLEASE bring back the Fair to Light shade! The Light to Medium is too dark and orangey for me. Is there anywhere I can find Fair to Light? Would definitely recommend the Fair to Light.
Loved this product but sorry to find med/deep has been discontinued. Used it for years and it was perfect color and coverage. Will have to find other brand now.
"The only reason I've given one star is because of the shade. I used fair to light for years.The light to medium is much too dark and looks orange. I LOVE the price, texture and coverage. PLEASE bring back Fair to Light!"
PLEASE bring back medium to dark! Have used it exclusively for years and love Everything about it! I can't use the fair to medium so will have to find a replacement. No luck so far.
I would give 5 stars in every category for fair to light!!! The light to medium doesn't work for me at all and my skin looks orange. Please bring back the fair to light and I will Use this product again.
"I agree 100% with previous review(s) - have used the ""Fair to Light"" product for years and am deeply disappointed I can no longer find it anywhere. Sorry Olay, After 25 years I am shopping for another skin care provider."
"I LOVE this product, I am of indian decent and this color matches me perfectly! I was so dissapointed to learn I can't buy it in my color anymore :( Please, please bring it back!"
PLEASE bring back fair to light. This is too dark for my skin tone. I will not buy any other Olay products until I can find this color. Garner is looking pretty good to me.
Please do not discontinue this product. I've used it for years. I have sensitive skin and it works well for me. I use other olay products and will be disappointed if I can no longer buy it.

I use this in winter so my skin is always protected with the SPF. Does the work of 3 products and looks great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Great coverage. Lite easy application. I like the all in one product so I don't need to apply two or three products. This one dies it all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I decided to try this the other day. It blends perfectly with my skin type. I think this is a keeper. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This product provides good coverage. I was not thrilled with the color. Very difficult to match my natural skin tone. I personally prefer the olay tint product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I tried 3jugsof this stuff and I want to tell you it is much too expensive for all the sio called good that it does. You have a good product in the Olay beauty cream. Why cant you let well enoughalone?
"First time user - light, most comfortable makeup I've used."
This is my go to. But my skin color changes from summer to winter. Why the Change in product choices? Not every skin has the same color.
I used to buy your BB Cream in light to medium. This was my go to moisturizer. I miss it. Will you ever bring it back?
Nice stuff. Makes my skin happy when I use this. Treats the skin as well as lightly giving a more finished look.
loved this product & want a little darker tint. I have tried to use the light to medium & it's too light.
Heartbroken. No longer available in Fair to Light. Was favorite product for years! Will have to find another brand to match my skin tone.
Nobody needs this product more than we with fair skin. Please bring that shade back! It is my go-to product!
I must buy a competitive product because you no longer carry my tone. What's up with that? I'm very annoyed.
I love this product but can no longer find my shade. Please bring back fair to light!! Until then I must turn to another brand.
Awesome effects on face because as soon as I applied on my face all my facial marks started disappearing
I have been using the 'Fair to Light' tone of this product for years. Where did it go? The Light to Medium is too dark for me.
I have been using this product for quite awhile and I can't believe it's discontinued. Please bring back this product!
"I am so upset. Finally I found a product I love and you discontinued my color????? Please, please tell me I am wrong."
"I am unable to find this, my favorite makeup, any more. Please tell me you haven't discontinued it. I have worn it for years and love it!!!"

I have used OLAY over 20 years and I love everything I have purchased. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the worst Olay product I've tried. It is a little slimy, so it doesn't go on well or cover well."
I love this! But I need the medium to dark and can not locate it anywhere.
"Goes on smooth, feels light and gives nice color to skin"
Does wonders for skin tone. My complexion looks almost dewy.
I love the darker tone and cannot find it anywhere.
I love this product but please bring back the deeper shade. Light to Medium is not right for me.
"Love this product, but light to medium looks chalky on my skin. Where can I get medium to dark?"
I need Medium to dark and can't find it. Have switched to another product which isn't Olay.
"I like this product but need ""Fair to Light"". All I can find now is ""Light to Medium"""
Feels really good on your skin. I have waited so long for the sensitive skin to come out. I just love it.
