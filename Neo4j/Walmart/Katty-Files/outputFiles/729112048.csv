"ALl I can say is WOW, my Dermatologist gave me samples and I started using it daily, have not had to use my prescription ointments since I have been using Cerave, my skin is softer and my hands are no longer raw and cracked, itching is very minimal and I have none when I use this product."
I've had psoriasis for 8 years and this is the best lotion I've ever tried. I'm currently pregnant right now and all I can use is steroid cream on my skin but after I found this lotion that steroid cream will be thrown away this lotion works amazing it makes your skin stay hydrated and no more FLAKES I recommend this to anyone best over the counter product
"After a year of dermatological topical treatments, I discovered Psoriasis Moisturizing Cream which reversed the inflammation and allowed healing of the fissures on my feet. For me, this was no small blessing, and today, I am very grateful for the research and development making the Psoriasis Moisturizing Cream into a “Gold Standard” treatment."
I started using this moisturizer around 2012 because my face would get so dry & cracked from winter. This is the only cream that works well for me. I don't break out and its high quality moisturizers.
I've tried other high end brands but this is the best.
"I have acne, I use retinol and I naturally have very dry skin."
This stuff is MAGICAL!
Tried lots of other brands and they either: broke me out or left a weird
Sorry but decided that ointment would come out of a tube. First of all came with no protective covering the opening. Its now two days and cannot squeeze it out of the tube.....huh? whats with this. Needless to say it was recommended to me but so far cannot get to it
"I have been using this for probably about a year and continue to be pleased with it. I started using it for eczema on my feet and it's been the only product to work well long term. I started using retin-a for my acne in the fall and it really dried my face out. I bought another tub of this for my face and it again showed me how well it works! I typically only use it on my face at night, but have in the morning as well and it does not feel heavy throughout the day. It's not very greasy and absorbs quickly."
"I have very sensitive skin, and combined with my eczema flare ups, I felt like no matter what I was using wasn't working for me. My dermatologist recommended I try this and Cetaphil, but this worked out better for me. I've gone through so many containers of these and it was worth every penny and honestly, I don't think I can live without this! I use this at night after my shower, and in the morning after I wash my face and it really keeps my skin smooth and not itchy. If you haven't already, please try this out!"
"This cream is frantastic! I have eczema and psoraisis and faithful use of this after my shower yields soft skin. My problem is the lid-too slick, especially in the bathroom. The same is true for the PM face cream in the purple line-fabulous product-lousy packaging."
This cream has fixed my problems ..i came from abroad to get it..in a matter of 4 days the results on my craked skin of my fingers were outstansing..cracks gone!
I had scaly dry skin on my face. Tried a number of products. With CeraVe the scales were gone in three days. I will continue to use daily.
"I have used this product for years, but the daily moisturizing lotion is no longer scent free. I, along with others, now note a rancid odor after application. I can no longer say it's a great buy!!"
Received a sample from dermatologist and used on thigh guttate psoriasis for several days. Skin is smoother and psoriasis less noticeable and seems to be clearing up.
"This product has made my skin soft and smooth, I have tried every product on the market with no improvement. My dr told me about cerave and my skin is unbelievable soft."
"I am in my late 40's and this is the second cold-weather season that I have experienced itchy skin all over my body. With aging comes dry skin. This product is amazing. It immediately relieved the itch due to dry, winter skin. It moisturizes so well yet leaves my skin feeling clean and silky. Zero oily, tacky residue. And truly fragrance free. Thank you, CeraVe!"
I purchased this because it got great reviews from a dermatologist on YouTube. This is great when intense moisture is needed. I love this for my heels and the backs of my hands. It does wonders for my cuticles too. Super thick consistency and somewhat hard to spread but worth it due to the results. Goes on smoothly after a shower. I would not use this on my face though. This is a must have especially during the winter months.
I get contact dermatitis from multiple products. This moisturizer keeps my skin protected from these allergens! I use it after my shower on my arms and neck (areas I break out) and haven't had an issue since using this! So happy I took a chance on this! I recommend this to everyone!
"I tried this for the first time last night and already I can see a difference. Best part, I wasn't scratching my leg all night long."
I love this product I've used it in the past but the certain ones that I really like they don't sell on the side of the mountains so I'm just glad to try this new one out and find out how good it works
"This stuff is like MAGIC. I've dealt with psoriasis my entire life. It had gone away for a few years until the beginning of this year (2019). It was terrible, painful and absolutely embarrassing wearing short sleeve shirts. I found this at my local WM and within 5 days, my elbows were practically clear. I could wear whatever with no second thought on how it looked. It was freeing and I'm so thankful I bought it."
I have acne prone skin. Very sensitive. This moisturizer is good even for acne-types or oily. Use in the evening.
"Needs to be a sealed container. The last plastic container I purchased, someone had dug into it. I will definitely check container before I purchase again."
I love this cream!!! My skin is dry so I put it on after my shower and my skin sucks it right up. It plumps up my skin on my arms so I know it is moisturizing my skin.
"I cannot go anywhere without my lil tub of cerave cream. It moisturizes my skin so well, as a very oily acne-prone skin girl. This doesnt break me out at all and doesnt make my skin oily. It absorbs right into my skin, as I use it on my wet face and body right out of the shower, and it creates a barrier to allow all the water to soak into my skin! When this says developed with dermatologists, they mean it! It's fragrance free and just amazing for your skin!! Highly recommend!!!!"
This product is highly moisturizing without being greasy. I find it to be very gentle on my skin. It is wonderful for dry patches. I'm easy to irritate and this is great. Love the fact it has no scent. I use this cream and also have the lotion. The tub lasts quite awhile and really soothes. I use it mostly on the body but I do out it on my face when I get dry skin. Good product !
"I love this product and what it does for my skin. I have considerably dry skin and topping my skincare routine off with this product is just the icing on the cake! Throughout the day my skin doesn't flake or anything, it just stays whipped and moisturized."
"I have looked for a product like Cerave for years! I have tried so many lotions and creams for my dry skin, but all have been disappointments in one way or another. Cerave isn't sticky on application and the main benefit is how it continues to keep my skin smooth and silky. My husband, who is a mechanic, has begun using the cream on his dry hands. I'm really glad I found you, Cerave!"
"I use this as my night moisturizer and it works amazing!! Before I started using it, I had lots of breakouts and dry areas. This moisturizer has helped make my skin healthy-looking. When I wake up in the morning, my skin looks great!! The cream is pretty thick, so I don't use it in the morning. Also, I have been using it for several months and there is still over half of it left in the jar. So, it lasts a long time."
"CeraVe Moisturizing Cream is the best body cream on the market. You don't need a lot of product to enjoy it. It may appear to go on tacky as first, but wait. Your skin will soon become smooth like velvet. All jar packaging without a pump is inherently gross. I don't care how clean you think your hands are, you are spreading germs and bacteria into the jar each time you use it. Buy the pump version!! BUY THE PUMP VERSION. CeraVe please offer pump versions in your other body creams."
"I love, love, love this product! I've used the pump bottle lotion & cream. They both last a long time. I would 100% recommend it."
I started putting the Psoriasis cream on my feet right before I got into bed and after 3 days I would see and feel a huge difference. My heels don't have that white crusty look anymore. It is now part of my CeraVe regime. Love it!
"All of Cerave's products are well made. Save yourself the cost of high-end moisturizers. I have tried all of the pricey ones. Compare ingredients. Cerave has all the things skin needs to fight aging, wrinkles, and dryness."
"I've never in my life used a lotion that does anything CLOSE to what this product does for my skin! It's soft, smooth, and supple now. I'm a 63 year old woman and my skin has never been better! Love it!!"
Hydrated but not oily
Skin stays hydrated all day and night
I received a sample and I love it. It makes my skin feel so supple.
I AM SIXTY YEAR WOMAN SINCE TEENAGER I HAVE A DRY SKIN SINCE I FUND THIS CREAM I DONT BUY any more CREAMS WORK WONDERFUL
"It actually helps with the flare ups, and smooths skin"
This is the only product that keeps my skin feeling hydrated and free of redness and scales from the psoriasis.
I tried this product one day. My skin was so irritated all day while at work. I will never use this again
My husband uses this cream. He will not use cortisone cream and he finds this cream works great for him to control the itching and burning.
"Works as advertised but leaves approximately 20% of the product in the bottom of the dispenser when it stops pumping. Pump wand will suck a hole in the product, it does not self level."
Great product would give it 5 Stars if it did not have parabens
"This cream has worked very well for me, much better than other brands. It acts as an exfoliant which helps too. give it a try!"
Just tried this as I have a slight case of psoriasis especially in the fall and winter around my nose and the back of my neck near the hair line. Love this stuff. Have been using this every night. It has really helped with the flaking and itching.
This product is just ok for me. My dermatologist gave me a sample pack of this with the psoriasis cleanser. They don't aggravate my psoriasis but they aren't making it clear up either. Did not seem to help with itching even though I used it frequently throughout the day.
As far as moisturizers go though its pretty good.
