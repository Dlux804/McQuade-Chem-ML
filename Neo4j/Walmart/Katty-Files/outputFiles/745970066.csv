"I used the honey Manuka Cleanser Calming Moisturizing soothing in the morning it was smooth and freshing. Honey manuka day gel cream was lite and refreshing to my skin. Love it, The honey I royal jelly eye cream was fresh lite under my eyes. Honey night cream gave my skin life also I would buy earth to skin again."
"I like this starter kit. I am using over a week now. I have very dry skin. It keeps my skin hydrated and moisturized. I use night cream and eye cream at night. After washing my face with the cleanser I apply day cream. I have noticed my skin is really soft, smooth and clean. No white dry patches. The only thing I dont like is the hive smell. It does work well on my skin."
Definitely recommend it.
"This is a very nice and handy kit for traveling, I just had a short trip and it was very useful. All the products smell like honey and have a nice texture. It helped me to keep going with my skincare routine in 4 simple steps and have my skin moisturized and hydrated."
"I loved this starter kit. I really like when brands offer kits like this. It gives me a chance to try all of the products at once. I liked everything in this kit, but the day and and night creams were my favorite. I liked how well they went on and hydrated my face. They did not leave a oily feel or residue which I appreciated. After using everyday for a little over a week, I noticed my asking becoming more alive. It was hydrated and glowing. I definitely plan to purchase the full size products."
The Earth To Skin Honey Starter Kit was a good combination of a variety of kincare products infused with the multibenifits of honey. The starter kit contains all the basics needed to build a skincare regiment for various skin types. I greatly enjoy using this kit and will probably purchase in the future if it is available near me.
"I really liked how this felt on my skin. I'm weird when it comes to soap, lotions, creams anything really being on my skin. I find it difficult to find products that I don't have a ton of complaints about for this reason. The Honey Starter Kit was great though. It left my skin feeling soft and refreshed. I think the only complaint I have about it is the smell isn't the greatest but I can overlook that for the great feeling I get after using the products."
Great starter kit. Just from reading the story and the ingredients on the box I liked what I saw. I started using my kit and everything left my skin feeling soft and smooth. Had no breakouts due to these products and nothing irritated my skin. I've tried many kits and this one is great. Seems like a promising new brand.
I applied this product according to instructions for seven days so far. It doesn't have much of a scent to it but does smell good. The morning application feels smooth and nice on my face and the evening one felt tight. I personally didn't notice any difference from when I started until now but longer usage may lead to different results.
"The Honey Starter kit is easy to apply. The face wash, day cream, night cream and eye cream all smell faintly of honey. The texture of the night cream is thick and it smooths cleanly. The day cream cleanly spread onto my skin. I did not feel as though the cream came off immediately after putting it on. My skin has not broken out since I began using the honey starter kit."
"I received the Earth To Skin Honey Starter Kit and started using it right away. This skincare brand used good for you ingredients and the packaging is nice too. I've been using each product for over a week now. My 2 favorites are the day gel cream and eye cream. All products are super moisturizing and soothing. I have not experienced any irritation with the Earth To Skin Honey Starter Kit, so it's great even for the sensitive skin. Great product!"
"I just love the earth to skin honey starter kit after the first night I really could tell a difference my skin wasn't nearly as dry plus my skin is looking healthier love the cleanser ,day gel cream night cream plus eye cream I'm extremely satisfied and will definitely buy again and I have recommended it to my family and friends."
I love the Earth to Skin Honey Starter Kit. The day cream and night cream both leave my skin feeling super moisturized and it doesn't have any crazy noticeable scent which I love. I feel like the eye cream is helping as well. The face wash takes my foundation off and leaves my skin feeling clean and not sticky at all. I feel like the honey is helping to keep down the redness on my face and leaving my skin feeling fresh and looking awesome. These products are something I will continue to use in the future.
"My skin felt amazing after using the honey starter kit. I used all the products twice a day and I felt a difference in my skin from day one. The cleanser cleaned as it should but the eye serum and the moisturizer is where its at. My face feela hydrated, the skin feels tighter and its soft"
"I really wanted to like this but I just cannot recommend it. Most of the problem stems from the scent, it's awful. It's like a stale, imitation of honey. There was also an odd stinging when the two creams were applied, both day and night. The night cream was quite thick when applied, I'm not sure it will last long. It tended to flake off after application."
I have received the Honey Starter Kit. I've used the products everyday since I've received them. I was very surprised with how it made my skin feel very soft. I had my daughter test it as well to see if she felt the same way. I have recommended this product to friends and family. Thank you!!

Exceptional product. I've used raw honey on my face plenty of times in the past but never have purchased any face regimen before. This product was all natural ingredients and my husband said my face smelled like honey too. Leaving no residue or sticky feeling.

I am in love with my Honey starter kit. All the products in it work amazing and are super gentle on my skin. I let my 13 year old daughter who has sensitive skin use the products and they work great for her also.

I only got this yesterday so I haven't had the chance to try it for a few days but so far from what I have experienced I like how my face feels clean and the products don't feel heavy on my skin
This kit was truly amazing. I never realized that products with honey in them had the healing properties that they do. I thought the day and night creams were wonderful and just the right texture for the appropriate time of day.
I was excited to try this starter kit and love the cream and how it made my skin feel and I like how I look and I see a change in my skin and I need to buy full size products

I have a lot of skin and digestive allergies and sensitivities and the Earth to skin honey makuna night cream work so well on me! I've been using it now for about four weeks and I can definitely tell a difference in my skin when I don't use it. I've started using it on a surgery scar that has healed and I'm hoping that it's going to help that soften up. my plastic surgeon has told me it's okay to use it.
Didn't really like the cleanser and gel moisturizer. The night cream did not irritate my sensitive skin but felt greasy. Liked the eye cream. I gave it all a week before going back to foaming clenser and garnier gel moisturizer.
"Good smell, makes skin feel soft, my blemushes/marks are improving, great price"
