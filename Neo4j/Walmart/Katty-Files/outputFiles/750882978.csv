"Let me tell you this product is AWESOME! I feel a difference already within 24 hours! I feel beautiful! It is already making my skin look radiant, not too sticky!Just perfect! It makes my skin feel smooth, and silky, NOT oily. I have naturally dry skin, awesome product! I use it for sure at night, and sometimes in the mornings too. LOVE it. :)"
"Decided to buy this product, first few nights I decided to only try on half of my face just incase it made me break out or something and in the morning I really did notice a difference. In the night you can feel it for the first like 30 minutes then it completely absorbed. But half of my face was soo soft. A week later started using it on all of my face at night and I really do plan on sticking with this product for a while. Product didnt make me break out and my skin just feel so soft in the morning."
"I never tried the equivalent Olay product, but this is extremely moisturizing. I tend toward dry, irritated, flakey sin because I use retin-a and a strong vitamin c serum. both of those products have really helped keep the wrinkles away but the dryness and irritation is a problem. when I use this over the return a cream when I wake up my skin is smooth and moisturized with no redness and no irritation. love it."
I am very impressed by this product. My skin wakes up beautifully hydrated (not greasy or oily) and baby smooth.
"Spend 10 more dollars and get the brand name, this is awful. It left me sticky and didn't absorb, even after 2 hrs of waiting to see and was hard to remove from my skin. The product states it's velvety, fast absorbing, and not sticky...total lies. I use and have used equate brand beauty products that I like but this is definitely not one of them"
I do not like this at all. I've been using the Olay for years and thought I would give this a try. It makes my face feel greasy and itchy and I don't have any issues with my face.
"I have used the Olay version of this product without issue. This is a terrible generic version. I have normal skin, and this stuff dried out my skin so bad I have dry, scaly red patches on my neck and cheeks. The cream dries tacky and feel like it does not absorb into the skin whatsoever."
My face is very sticky when I apply this. It does not absorb at all.
