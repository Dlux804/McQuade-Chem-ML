"Have been buying this face cream for some time and find it does the job I look for. It provides a SPF 15 protection, glides on smoothly, is not greasy, mositurizes and is my daily base. Once it is absorbed, I apply my makeup, which is primarily a little cover cream and a face powder which acts as a base. Keeping skin moist is vital and this products is a definite aid in doing so."
"I have used this cream for more than a year now. I have never taken good care of my skin, so I don't expect to look 50 again, or for all the wrinkles to disappear. But it definitely has improved the overall look, feel and appearance of my skin. My friends have remarked on the improvement. I like the light texture of the cream and the fact that it doesn't leave your skin feeling greasy."
I started using this product last year. I use it morning and night. Even though I do not look as good as Nicole Kidman I feel there has been improvement in my skin. Thank you for this great product!
Excellent quality product that really works. Best I have ever used!!
"I've used this product for over two years, believe it has helped keep skin soft and less wrinkles...."
"I know this cream is working because my skin has been exfolliating more than normal. The product goes on, and it can feel a little tacky, but give a few minutes and it soaks in nicely. Have not used the product very long, but so far I am pleased with it. Love that it is fragrance-free."
I bought this about two weeks ago and it arrived on time. I have never been a woman to wear make-up or use facial products of any kind so this was new for me. I must say I was surprised. My face looks firmer and brighter and it feels much softer. I am thankful for I just turned 59 and am trying to look 49! Thank you very much for a very nice product that really works!!!
I have been using this product for years and have been told I look younger than my 74 years.
"This stuff really works well, but if you have very sensitive skin, you might only use it a couple times a week to start. It would sting and make my skin red if I used it every night. I use it every 2 days and it is doing fine now."
I've used for a few weeks now and I'm really disappointed. I don't notice any difference. This is basically a moisturizer without sunscreen. Rapid wrinkle repair with sunscreen is far better but I can't afford that now.
"This is the best skin cream I have used to date. Fragrance free, quick absorption, lightweight, and leaves my skin soft, hydrated, and radiant. Love it!"
"I used 7 jars of your Wrinkle Cream and I cannot see any results at all. I had 2 jars left and I tossed them in the trash. It also leaves a oily, greasy film on the skin which I also did not like."
I have been using Neutrogena for about 5 years. The products continue to get better. I can use all of the products except the pump face cream. It is to thick for my skin. Other than that it is the best out of any product I have used.
"I've tried all of the other upper lines, and this is the only one that did what it stated, and for me, it did even more. No irritation, no redness, just glowing skin. I'm staying with Neutrogena. Thanks for a terrific product."
I bought this a few weeks ago and can already see a very good result on some deeper wrinkles. Use day and night. Works well under makeup for day. Very happy with product.
"Just got this and was extremely excited about the product, however, on the 3rd day, where I had been applying it, my eyes were red, tender and swollen. I can no longer use the product, but it did seem to be working."
"I am very happy with this product. There is a definite improvement in the texture and appearance of my skin. The only drawback is that, so far, there is not much difference in sun damage spots that I was hoping for."
"It took about a week to receive. It smells good, and goes on nice under my eyes. I wear under my concealer and looks good. I haven't used it very long so we will see how it works. I did notice a very little burning sensation but like super mild and it goes aways after a minute or less. I am excited can't wait to see results."
I am disappointed; I have very sensitive skin but thought I could use neutogena. But on day 4 my skin is blistered around my eyes
I have tried so many other moisturizers that cost 3-8 times more. This is by far the best. Absorbs into the skin easily. Love this!
I made the purchase over a month ago. I have been faithful using it twice a day
for at least a week but gradually did it daily. I do not see any difference at all.
Wrinkles are still same as ever !!!!
"My skin is too dry to withstand your product. I saw NO wrinkle reduction after 2 weeks, only very peeling skin and increased dryness. Will go back to other products by OLAY ProX."
"I bought the complete product line of the Wrinkle Repair products for Christmas. I am light skinned and am very sensitive to some products. I love the Regenerating cream, it leaves my skin so soft and smooth. After 3 weeks of use I do see a change in my smaller wrinkles. I have switched from Clinique to the Rapid Wrinkle Repair line. I love these products."
"I was super excited for this and the first day I put it on I loved it until my face started burning under my eyes and I had read that it might be a little warming sensation so I went along with it. Used it the next day and woke up with red patches under my eyes. Waited another couple days and tried again. Wish I could post pictures because I have some. My skin is peeling it hurts to touch, I'm afraid my skin is going to be messed up from this. Would not recommend. I've been trying to put aloe on it to stop the burning."
I bought this product last week I've been using it for three days . The skin around my eyes are very burned and irritated . I have been putting cold compresses on my eyes and it hurts even more and causes it to increase in Redness. I am very disappointed with this product and will never buy Neutrogena again
"I purchased this cream based on online reviews. I have used the cream on my neck 3 times and woke up this morning with a huge itchy, red rash. So disappointed. I was looking for a good quality cream with retinol. I'm worried the skin on my neck is going to be permantly damaged the rash is so bad."
I bought this product because I was looking for wrinkle reduction. After two days the skin around my eyes burned and touching it was unbearable. Now the area is swollen and my eyelids are drooping. Nothing gives me comfort. I want my money back. This product should not be on the market.
"I purchased this product three weeks ago, and with my initial application, I noticed a burning sensation. I continued to use it for 3-4 additional days thinking it would calm down, but the burning persisted. It got so bad the final night, I had to get out of bed to wash it off. I discontinued using it and contacted the company."
Very happy that I use the products will never stop
I bought this product to help reduce in lines around my eyes. It works for me. Would buy it again.
This cream feels silky and my skin is soft. No smell and feels great!
Great product that has made a big difference in the smoothness of my skin
I have been using my face cream for about 2 1/2 weeks and I am happy with the results
Bought it like 2 weeks ago I love it I will buy it again
The antiaging wrinkle cream is wonderful. I enjoy the product. It is a very good product.
"Nice product, haven't used it long enough to see any change, but, it feels good on the face. The price is reasonable."
With any retinol product you must go SLOW when introducing it to your skin. This product is comparable to very high-end products- I would say I prefer it.
I bought this over the weekend and am terribly disappointed in this very expensive product. Extreme redness along with scaly red skin under my eyes. It burns and hurts to touch. I would love to return to store but threw away box and receipt.
I used this product for 3 days and stopped because of the burning. I have not used this in 4 days and the pain and burning are even worse. I have huge burn marks under both eyes. It's very painful.
"I am about to turn 50 and thought to buy this product. Not even a week of use, my skin has developed red patches and burns. It is extremely uncomfortable And I have never experienced this until I use this product."
"I haven't had enough time to see if it's a good fit for my skin or not, I have extremely sensitive skin and all kinds of things break my face out, but I've been using this four days now and I'm seeing great results already. The cream is so light and smooth! I love the way it makes my face feel after I use it. I am starting to see more pimples on my face however but I blame my skin for that issue!!! It might be because of hormones though so I'm not ruling this one out just yet! This is a great product and I highly recommend it!!"
"Just been using this for a week now. I have T-zone skin, even at my age. I love the fact that there is no fragrance. There is no need for fragrance in cosmetics. I was in the cosmetic field for many years and often wondered why they put so much fragrance into their product. So far, I haven't notived any real difference yet, but again it's only been a week."
"I have been using this product for about four weeks now. I do notice an improvement in my skin feeling moisturized. Some improved appearance in the fine lines around my eyes. The BEST thing I like about it is there is little or no fragrance. I plan on using the two jars I purchased to give it a fair trial. But so far, so good!"
I used it for two weeks and it left my skin around the eyes rough. I would never use this product. I am very disappointed.
"I have been very happy with Olay products, but decided to try. I see a difference, without any irritation. I see now that Olay is introducing a retinol, but not sure I will immediately try."
"I'm a repeat customer. I was disappointed, however, for the second time there was a large air bubble in one jar (haven't opened the other). This meant less product. I love the cream and will continue to purchase."
I've used this for the last year and I still love it. It last long and does everything it states. My favorite part is the Hyaluronic Acid that helps plump your skin. I've used ROC in the past and this so much better. You see the results fast and your skin feels soft. It doesn't clog my skin or cause acne. A little goes a long way. This is well worth the cost.
"I have been using the Rapid Wrinkle Repair for a couple of years. I didn't realize how much it was helping until I ran out and got lazy and went without it for a few weeks. I noticed wrinkles that I hadn't noticed before. I started using this product again and within 1 week, the fine lines were gone again! I LOVE this stuff! People always think I'm 5 to 10 years younger than I am :)"
"Been using about 2 weeks and can see a slight difference already in my deep craters on cheeks and crows feet! But, its just starting to burn in the morning and by the time I get to work my face is red. Today I notice that area is flaky dry. I also wonder if this is right for me or if I should be using the intensive therapy?"
"I bought this cream about a month ago. Got tired of the peeling and irritation from Retin A. ( And I used Retin A VERY sparingly and as directed ) As a woman approaching 60, and wanting to take care of my skin, I thought I would give this a try. I have used Neutrogena products in the past and have never been disappointed. And I have to say, this is what I have been looking for! It makes my skin feel and look great! Definitely part of my new skin care!!"
"I have used Neutrogena brand for 40 yrs. This rapid wrinkle repair is new to me. After about 3 days my husband noticed that I ""look as young as when we started dating"". That was 10 yrs ago! Well its been 2 weeks now, and I am thrilled with the glowing firm smooth texture of my face and neck. Thank you Neutrogena for my new go to face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this one week ago and I notice some improvement in fine lines already! So many over the counter products make me break out but not this, which is an added bonus for sure. So far I am very pleased, and I think the price point is great. I've tried some boutique brands that are more than double the price. Very happy I found something that works that is more affordable!"
"I have been using this product for a little over a week and about 5 days ago my eyes started rearing terribly and they've been tearing constantly. the skin around my eyes was very red and Flaky and cracked. How can I get a refund for this product? And, I think it's a constant irritation for my eyes. my skin feels and looks softer and smoother however this irritation to my eyes is horrible and my eyes are watering"
"I tried this hoping it would help with lines and brighten up my skin, felt great first 3 days on 4th day started to burn so gave it a break for a day (as recommended) but my eye area got worse and looked and felt like burns, 5 days on and my eyes are a mess, sore and flaking. I don't have sensitive skin. Very worried that I have permanent damage."
I have mixed emotions about this product. I see a difference but the difference is it seems to highlight more wrinkles then I see before I started the product. Including my skin now is dry and rough and flaking and pealing. I am only using once a day and I am unsure if I should continue use at this point.
"After a couple of uses, I noticed burning on my skin. I thought it is repairing. I continued for a couple of days more. My skin started peeling off and the burning was unbearable. It has been a week now that I stopped using it, still, my skin did not recover from the burn. BTW, I don't have a sensitive skin."
"This stuff is absolutely amazing. I have super sensitive skin, and most makes make me break out. This is one of the only ones that does not! I've used it twice in less than a week and am loving it already. Plus a little goes a long way with this so it"
will last me a long time. I also look a lot less dry and stressed. I can definitely see myself buying more of this.
"The product blended easily and a little bit went a long way. There was no overbearing smell as it was scent free. It did not feel heavy or greasy. It does not leave m yskin looking shiny, but it looks smooth and matte. I like that it makes my skin look healthy and full of life. I do not like heavy creams and this one is not heavy. I have tried other creams and this one feels better after application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the creamy feel of this cream .I also like that it has no scent. It is very easy to apply, absorbs well, feels good on skin. Very gentle while working to help minimize fine lines and wrinkles. After 1 week I have noticed a difference. My 11's are lessened which I am so happy about! I anticipate even more wrinkles disappearing with continued use. I love this cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought this product for my mom to use to help with the wrinkle around her eyes. It did not help at all. My mom's skin get burned + it becomes rough after using it for 3 days. It completely destroyed the smoothness of the skin. Didn't expect that. Wouldn't recommend!
"In my opinion as far as I am concerned is that it is not rapid results at all. I have tried it for over a week and yes while it does make my skin softer, it does not really repair wrinkles. I have minimal wrinkles and it does little, if not nothing to"
repair my wrinkles
"I loved how well it worked.My face looked vibrant and smooth.I also like the fact that it's not heavy scented and I felt no side effects,like other creams cause.I highly recommend it,works really well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Neutrogena® Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream delivered and I felt like within a week I has smoother, more youthful skin. I could see the product working because I had flakier skin at first, like it was uncovering my smoother skin underneath. I will buy again and can't wait to see the long term effects of this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love Neutrogena products and this is another to add to my list of favorites. What I love about it is that it softens my skin and relaxes the wrinkles. The best part its it doesn't feel greasy like most others do. The sample they sent was full sized and I'm still using it daily. But when I run out I'll be buying more! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have not had any reactions on my face (I avoid the eye area), my neck is badly scarred - red and itchy. It's embarrassing because I have to go to work with makeup on my neck now - to hide the redness. I am going to give it a break for a few days and see if the redness and itchiness go away."
I have been using this every evening before bed for years. I remember thinking my pores were getting larger before I started. I don't think much about it these days and I've recently had a couple of people comment on how smooth my skin looks. I am a few months away from 60.
"I used on my face/neck for years until it started causing eczema after another product got the eczema going to begin with. I'm 63 y/o and am frequently thought to be in my 40's, so I think it works. I still use it on my hands and my hands are still smooth and lovely, with only a few very light-colored sunspots. I'm fanatical, and always have been, about protecting my face/neck/hands from sun exposure, tho."
"I have used this cream 3 times in the past 2 weeks and now have a itchy, red rash all over my neck."
I've been using this product for about 5 days - It works!
"Pro: I can really see improvement in just one week. Just wow. Con: wish Neutrogena included safety seal. Box mangled. With no jar seal, someone could've tampered with contents."
"I started using this product about a year ago. As with other neutrogena products I have found them to do their job as described. Love this product in particular and often find my husband dipping into the jar as well. Great product, great value."
I have been using this product for about 3 weeks. Skin tone is more even and fresher looking. Am very happy with this product and pleased it has helped restore texture to a 751/2 year old face.
"I was really excited when I bought this cream, but it was a big disappointment. I used the cream for 2 days and my skin is terrible dry, red, burning, my face is peeling."
This is an excellent product. I noticed a visible difference after just a couple of applications. It's lovely on the skin and easily accessible at the drug store. Well worth the cost and effort to apply continuously for excellent skin!
i just bought this product and i love how it makes my skin feel and it doe not make your skin feel tight like some of the wrinkle products my skin is smoother and i love the feel of it
"I received a free sample from Home Tester Club and I was a bit skeptical at first. After using for a week, a noticed a big difference in my skin, brighter, tighter and overall healthy looking. Plan on using this product forever!!"
I could literally do a commercial for this cream! My skin drinks it in and sometimes I think I hear it go ahhhhhh. It smells great and doesn't clog my pores. Goes on a bit heavy but sinks in within a couple of minutes. Does wonders for my skin.
I was satisfied with the product. It was fragrance free and very easy to use. Left my skin moisturized also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the pump for years, switch to the cream 2 months ago 5 days later was in love with it and ordering my second jar now , Love it my face feels and looks great for a 71 year old"
I have been using for 4 days now. I thought that this was going to be a great product but now my area just below my eyes are rered and feel like they are burnt. I hope I haven't damaged my skin permanently.
Feels so smooth and actually works to repair wrinkles instead of hiding them or covering them up. Love the results [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am hoping for the best and it is easy to apply. Looks good so far and am happy with it.
I don't think I will look younger but it feels nice
"I honestly wasn't expecting too much from this in terms of skin cell turnover being that it was just an over the counter retinol cream, but to my surprise (and delight) I actually noticed that it was causing my skin to peel and exfoliate! I've been using it for a couple weeks now so I can't say I see huge improvement, but with the way its working so far I can only imagine it will help with preventing aging and helping my fine lines. I also love that it's fragrance free, and I wish Neutrogena would do this for all its products."
"I started using Neitrogena products including the facial device, once in the morning and in the evening, absolutely no change at all with any of my wrinkles. I know that you advertise immediate results in a week. Bit I figured that with anything you should give it sometime. I have been using these products for over 4 months and I feel like it's been a total waste of my money. .."
"I have been using this for 3 or 4 weeks and after 2 weeks, I had to stop using it on my neck. My neck was itchy and sore. Whatever I put on my neck stung. I could only use Vaseline on my neck until it healed. I kept using on my face and after another couple of weeks, I had to stop using it on my face. My face became very dry and a sore developed by my nose."
My husband and I purchased this product with a hope that our skin will look younger but the expectation turned to disappointment. After 3 days of using it our entire face got burned. It was very painful to touch. We already stopped using this and we will not use this anymore. It feels so sad that our money was wasted for nothing.
"This product was easily absorbed, no greasy or oily feeling left on skin. After using the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream for two weeks, I have noted a slight decrease in the wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead. I am eager to see what results I will experience with further usage! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really am enjoying my sample of Neutrogena® Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream, Fragrance Free. My favorite part is it being fragrance free since I am sensitive to fragrance. I have also seen a slight improvement in my laugh lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a thick creamy face cream and it doesn't leave you with a greasy oily feeling! I was pretty nervous at first, boy am I glad I tried this! My face feels amazing, healthy and nourished. I feel like my pores are smaller and I do not have any fine lines on my face! Totally hydrated! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
burns and swelling around eyes. red raw itchy skin. burning eyes.wanted to rip my eyes out. took a week to recover.
Feels great .. works great and quick on wrinkles ... great under make-up .. just a little over priced .. but I will buy again and do recommend
"Have used your products in past. Had high hopes for this product but it burned my neck, turned it red and dried it out. Took days to clear up."
The best part is this is a fragrance free cream. I am allergic to scents and such ingredients. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I like the texture and smell of this cream, it feels like good quality so I was hoping for good results. But I've been using it nightly for 6 months and haven't seen any changes in my fine lines, so will try something else next."

"Very creamy smooth cooling moisturizing cream that leaves my skin soft and great looking. My skin looks rejuvenated and plump after using this cream for the last two weeks, those pesky forehead wrinkles look so much better and my overall skin is smoother and younger looking. This cream absorbs nicely and very easy to apply makeup after use. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a good retinol Cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I've been using the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream twice a day for about a week now and I'm loving the results I'm seeing! The fine lines on my forehead and under eye area are very much less noticeable and my skin overall looks younger, more firm and lifted. I don't mind going without makeup for the first time in years!

"I'm a big fan of Neutrogena® Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream, Fragrance Free. A lot of wrinkle repair products either don't work or cause my skin to break out or burn. This felt great on my skin, and didn't redden my face at all. I plan to continue to use this product until it's empty and probably buy more. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recently tried Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream and was surprised by how much I liked it.

I highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Wonderful feel and great results. I wear it twice a day and my lines and wrinkles around the eyes and lips are less noticeable. I really like the scent and it is nongreasy and lightweight. Not heavy cream at all. Highly recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The cream is rich has a buttery texture, the cream also has a pleasant smell. I have sensitive skin , was gentle on my skin I used this on my neck area at night. Been using this for one week I have had no adverser reaction. I believe this is a product you need to keep using regularly to see the effects . But i'm pleased with the cream , will continue to buy and use.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product twice daily now for about a week now and I can honestly say that I have noticed that my skin is firmer than before using it. It is also brighter as well. I really like that it does not have a heavy scent to the product like a lot of other wrinkle creams. I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream, Fragrance Free for free in exchange for my honest review. The cream felt very soothing and smooth going on. It provided the moisture that I needed and did not cause any irritation to my sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was pleasantly surprised by this cream. Most items in this type of product normally smell pretty bad and do not really work well for me. This one was fragrance free, but a nice fragrance would have been acceptable, and although I haven't seen results yet I am happy with the way it feels on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used the product since receiving it and have noticed a difference in the fine lines around my eyes and the texture of the skin in my face.

The fine lines around my eyes were less noticeable after the first use and my overall skin texture seemed smoother. This is a product I would recommend.

Amazing face cream that I'm definitely going to purchase for myself. I have already purchased for my mom and sister as a present. I have been purchasing Neutrogena products off and on and this is a very nice thick cream. It absorbs well and it seemed to act little like some of the retinol products I have been using. My face is slightly red after application and feels tighter - so some of the wrinkles seem to disappear. Also my skin feels softer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Goes on easy, does not dry my skin out. Makes my skin feel really and its looking better and bettet each day. I have noticed an improvement my skin looking like the wrinkles are less vivisable and I am happy with that. With continued use I hope to see more improvement. Overall I am happy with this and have recommended it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin looks and feels great after using Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream for a few days. I like the fragrance free formula and I like the texture and consistency of this product. It absorbs well into my skin and it keeps my skin feeling soft and smooth all day. It is gentle on my skin but very effective. I am very happy with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love the way that this Neutrogena® Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream, Fragrance Free works to give you soft and smooth skin but also to decrease the look of wrinkles. I actually notice difference after only using it a couple of times. I also like that it is gentle on my skin and absorbs into the skin right away without leaving greasy feeling [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I loved the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream!!! It made my skin feel soft and smooth !! I spread it all over my face and neck area feeling only the slightest tingle knowing that the product is working , getting deep down in the skin !! I used it once in the morning and at night for best results !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Used this product for 7 days straight and my skin is very even toned, not irritated and it really smooths out the lines around my mouth. I was very diligent with remembering to use it everyday. I'm very interested to how my skin will look with a couple more uses. It's a big plus that the repair cream is unscented, sometimes the scented stuff is to overwhelming. I love neutrogena products, they work so well together when using a few different ones. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am in love with this face cream. It leaves my dry skin moisturized and I can also feel that it's tightening the skin. My skin looks more radiant and glowing and it feels like it's tightening the wrinkles a few minutes after I apply it. I'll definitely be purchasing this cream again and recommending it to my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the best anti-aging cream I've ever used. This cream really did work fast at reducing my fine lines and wrinkles. I could see results from day one with facial skin looking more moisturized, softer and fine lines less noticeable. After one week facial skin looked even better; fine lines even less noticeable. My facial skin is smoother, no longer dry and I am happy with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Neutrogena® Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream is the perfect and I mean perfect wrinkle cream. It's light and doesn't leave my skin feeling oily. It has truly started improving my skin - so much so that I get compliments on how good my skin looks. This has, in just a week, become an irreplaceable part of my routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
First I like that this product is gentle on my skin but contains retinol to help with rapid wrinkle repair. I like that it is fragrance free too and made by a company that I can trust. The cream absorbs well into my skin and didn't leave my face feeling at all greasy. The skin looks smoother on my face after using it for one week and I like the results so far that I have seen. I highly recommend this repair cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I liked the texture, felt smooth going on, now, I have used retina a before, years ago, and this bottle states it has highest amount of retina a without a prescription, n I'd say they r probably right, after 10 days I did notice a slight reduction in crows feet n my 11 lines, is say it's probably best u can get without a prescription.

Oh how I looked this product it's easy to apply and it's fragrance free it lite and airy on the skin you can hardly tell you applied it I've been using it for about a week and have seen a big difference in my skins appearance and elasticity that I differently will be using this from now on now that I am in my late 30's.

"I was so excited to try Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Regenerating Cream! I love that it's fragrance free as I am sensitive to many fragrances. It really helps to minimize the look of wrinkles and I love that I contains retinol for lasting results. My husband was jealous that I got to try this, so I'm getting him his own for Christmas.

I was skeptical initially about just another wrinkle cream. I was pleasantly surprised at how well Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair worked for my facial skin. It goes on smooth with no greasy feeling. I am certain my fine lines around my eyes and mouth have minimized. I am sold on this and the rest of my products have now become obsolete. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
