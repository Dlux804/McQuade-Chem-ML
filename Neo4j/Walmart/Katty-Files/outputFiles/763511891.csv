I started buying the Julep products about 2 years ago. I've never wore makeup but I wanted to take good care of my skin . And keep it healthy looking . ( I'll be 50 on my next b-day . ) Julep Korean skin care line of products are the best I found. Thank you Julep !
I love this oil. It feels so good and soaks in nicely. I have extremely dry skin so i use more then most people would need.
