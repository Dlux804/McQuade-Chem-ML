I am very happy with this whole line of products but this one is pretty great! It is strong enough to take off makeup like a breeze but so incredibly gentle on your skin. I have sensitive skin so I dont stray far from my basic skin care routine but I got this product for free to try out so I thought why not and it is the best decision I have made!
"This is good stuff! It's not scented which is great if that is an issue for you. The way I use this is after I cleanse my face, I follow up with this on a cotton ball and apply it in my face until the cotton comes out clean. My skin did not feel stripped at all. It felt refreshed and supple for once in a long time. I will be buying more once I run out."
I love micellar waters as pre-cleansers after wearing makeup all day. I normally revert back to my Garnier SkinActive Micellar Cleansing Water All-in-1 as its been my day 1 micellar water pick. Since trying this one Ive added it to my list of go-to micellar waters because its less heavy in oils compared to my Garnier. Its gentle on the skin and fragrance free!
"I absolutely love this olay product, it was great for my super sensitive skin, it didnt have that funky smell that most facial cleansers have. And I think this is a great value for the price. The packaging is convenient and fits in my makeup bag without any problem. Will definitely be buying this as soon as my bottle starts to run low!!! Thanks influenster for giving me the opportunity to try this out!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I unfortunately inherited pretty sensitive skin. A lot of products break me out. I was a little skeptical using this cleansing water for the first time, but it was actually really nice! It really cleaned off all my makeup and helped with the winter dryness. I have splotchy dry patches in the winter along with my breakouts. This helped to calm all those problem areas. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed using this product. I liked how light it felt, how easily it took off my make up and how smooth and light my skin felt after using it. I also havent been breaking out since I started using it and the redness in my skin seems to have calmed down. I dont have a lot of experience using cleansing water but I definitely will keep using this product."
"I really liked this product. I have very sensitive, dry skin especially on my face and the cleansing water was very gentle on my skin and removed all my makeup very easily with just two cotton pads! Even when I washed my face and used this product it took just one to remove all the residue that was left behind. I would definitely recommend!"
"I was a little hesitant when I first tried Olay Sensitive Calming Cleansing Water because Ive tried other water-based cleansers in the past that havent worked. However, so far this cleansing water has been a nice change from my usual cream based cleanser. Its great for use at night since its calming and doesnt irritate my sensitive skin. I probably wouldnt replace my regular cleanser with this, but its a fantastic addition to my bag of tricks. My rosacea-prone skin approves! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I didnt fall in love with it, I did like it. It felt good on my skin and didnt irritate it, but I did get some around my eyes and it made them burn. Nice packaging and made my skin feel soft. I dont have super sensitive skin so I cant say much on that but it didnt seem to bother my skin any! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have a sensitive skin. So I was really happy when I received this product. It keeps the skin hydrated and moisturized. My skin became really dry during the winter, and this essence has helped my skin to stay moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed this cleanser. It worked well and is perfect for those lazy days, which we all have. This worked really well to clean off all of the dirt on my face while leaving my face clean and not dry. I have extremely sensitive skin and this cleanser did not irritate me at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had high expectations for this product as i love cleansing water and love Olay. I found that it didnt clean as well as other brands I have used. Eye makeup didnt want to come off very well and i didnt have that fresh clean feeling afterwards. I was very surprised, like i said, I love Olay but this specific product Id have to give a thumbs down to. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This products is TRULY amazing. I used it on my eyes to remove waterproof mascara and it took it off with such ease and so quick! I must say I was surprised! It leaves the skin soft ro the touch and feeling hreat. The only small negative would be the smell, however while I'm not a fan of the smell, it isn't overpowering and it fades quickly. So thats alright. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Super gentle cleansing water that won't dry your skin out or clog your pores. Good price and a little goes a long way. I wish it came in a spray bottle to make it a little less messy when using a cotton pad. I will definitely be purchasing again.
"It's a lovely remover and at a great price. It works well for sensitive skin. It is very gentle and soothing. The smell is kind of strong in my opinion, but it works great! Hope this helps XoXo"
"Awesome product. I have combination skin, mostly oily and I tend to break out. This cleanser is easy on my skin, and does not dry out my face at all. Would highly recommend as a daily cleanser"
This product seems to work just like any other of its type. Nothing fancy about it. Gets the job done. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love the fact that my face feels fresh and rejuvenated immediately after use. Never tried this product before and would buy it again. Excited to watch my face clear up in the near future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've always really enjoyed Olay products, but this is probably my favorite product by the brand. My skin has been in a rough spot during the winter, but this has helped tremendously. Definite repurchase! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This cleansing water is pretty good. Not the best Ive tried or worse. When I ran out of makeup remover wipes the other day I tried this- And it took me 6 Cotten pads to remove all my makeup. It does refresh my face. Even though i received the sensitive skin one- I would of preferred it had a little bit of a scent then no scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Im using OLAY Sensitive Calming Cleansing Water with Hungarian Water Essence and am absolutely loving it. It contains aloe, cucumber, and tea extracts that soothes and keeps the skin hydrated and moisturized. I can instantly feel and see my skin nourished and cleansed. I love it so much, I cant wait to purchase it. *I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was excited to try the Olay Calming Cleansing Water, I liked that it does not leave my skin oily like other make up removers and it dries out quickly, although it does take a lot longer to remove makeup. It still does its job! I received this complimentary product by Influenster, Thanks!Olay Sensitive Calming Liquid Cleanser with Hungarian Water Essence [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Tried a lot micellar/cleansing waters and this one does the trick just like the others. The smell is quite pleasant for me too! I still have to wash it off with a second cleanser because I still believe these don't /entirely/ take everything off, so it's just a safety measure for me. Overall, decent product to clean off sunscreen and/or makeup! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This worked great. Normally there would be a oily feeling left after using something similar, but not with Olay. This was incredibly gentle on my skin, which is wonderful especially during the winter when my skin becomes dry as well as being sensitive. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is amazing! Took my makeup off with no problem. My skin felt clean and refreshed. It's a great product at a reasonable price. It has exceeded my expectations and I would definitely recommend to others! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I gave it really good, long try and used it every day but I don't see anything special about this particular formula. It feels a bit creamier than others I've used but other than that it works the same. It did a pretty good job at removing makeup and definitely didn't leave my skin dry or irritated, actually it was almost too oily but I have oil prone skin. I'd definitely buy it, depending on price point, for winter use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The cleansing water works okay. I didn't really notice much difference between this and tap water though. It sort of smears all over my face and takes a good amount of scrubbing and a few cotton pads to get the majority of my eye makeup off, but it doesn't take it all off. I do still need to follow up with a good makeup remover. It doesn't burn my eyes or irritate my senstive skin though so that's a plus. However, I don't think I would purchase this on my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My skin is sensitive but I had no issues using this product. It is gentle but strong enough to remove makeup. It left my skin feeling fresh. It didn't dry my skin out and it didn't leave it oily as many of these products do. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cleans your face really good and it works good for eye makeup as well. Just gotta hold it over your eye and then wipe off. It's not too great on mascara though but with a bit of scrubbing will take it off. Doesn't dry the skin out which is a great plus! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this cleansing water. It took one cotton pad with the cleansing water to get all of my mascara off. My face is really sensitive and I didn't experience and new breakouts when using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My face felt soft after using this which was great! The smell seemed like it would be nice and fresh at first,, but shortly, after it turned to a stale scent. Overall, just water and oils isn't really cleansing my my face and it seemed like an added step to my routine that was unnecessary. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I enjoyed using this cleansing water. It felt refreshing and didn't clog any of my pores. My eye make up was a little harder to remove compared to the rest of my face. Overall a nice product to use to get make up off your face without tugging too much. It didn't make my skin feel dry at all. I would definitely recommend!

"I recently received this product, I have been searching for something to help remove makeup at night but also not leave my skin feeling like I took all the moisture out of it. This product is amazing. My skin feels refreshed and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely loved the Olay Sensitive Calming Cleansing Water With Hungarian Water Essence. I recently started wearing makeup again and would use baby wipes to wipe it off because of my skin being sensitive. This worked great and left my skin feeling fresh and with no irritations. I will be buying this in the near future and trying the other Olay sensitive line of products. Thank you so much Influenster! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I actually really like this as a make up remover! It's for sensitive skin which I really appreciate. There's no smell which is a big plus for me. I really dislike oily removers and was pleasantly surprised that this feels like plain water. I will admit that I wasn't sure how well it would perform but it took the make up off so easily. There was no real effort involved. Not even for the mascara. I would definitely buy this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used a few different cleansing waters in the past and this one was a solid contender. I have sensitive skin that gets very dry in the winter and I found this product to be gentle and didn't leave my skin extra dry. If you have a lot of makeup on it does take a few cotton pads to remove everything. Overall I really liked this and would likely buy again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is an awesome product, my make up came off super quick, it did not feel irritating around the eyes. Even my Mascara came off pretty quickly with out having that smeared raccoon eye look. There is a large possibility I will purchase this in the future. My face feels nice and soft and I love that it doesn't have a scent. This is my face after using olay sensitive Calming cleansing water. Olay Sensitive Calming Cleansing Water with Hungarian Water Essence [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this to take the remnants of my makeup off. I used my cleanser after and used this one more time and my face felt so clean and refreshed. I would honestly buy this again when I run out. Hands down love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have sensitive skin and this did not irritate my skin. This works really well to get rid of the stubborn leftover mascara that can be difficult to remove. A little bit of product goes a long way. I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was skeptical at first, especially since I got it in my eye (don't do that lol) but it took off my makeup incredibly well- even my eye makeup... and it didnt leave my face feeling greasy, but also didn't leave it tight and dry. And no itchiness! Other cleansing ""waters"" have agitated my super sensitive skin, but not this one ! I'd be interested to try the other products in this line because this one has been great so far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Soooo light weight!! I thought my skin would be left with a layer of gunk because the water essence seemed somewhat thick in the bottle but it felt so light on my skin and did a really good job of getting rid of the dirt and oil. I noticed a small bit of dryness after use, which I tend not to prefer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had never heard of this product before I received it for testing but Olay is one of my go to brands. This product got my makeup off without me having to tug at my skin and it did not irritate my somewhat sensitive skin. I like how clean and fresh it left my skin. I find it works best if you use with a facial cotton. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This is the first time I used this product and I instantly felt the difference in my skin using it. My makeup came right off and my skin just felt softer and I guess lighter because there wasn't any left over makeup in my pores. I want to get the rest of the product in this line now. Definitely recommend this to people! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product! It easily removed my mascara and foundation. It has a super mild scent you almost can't smell. I like that it is a oil free formula. It left my face fresh without overly drying it out. I definitely will buy more once I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Does a really great job at removing makeup and leaves my skin feeling refreshed and clean! Sometimes I just use this product whenever my skin is feeling dry after I've had a chemical peel and it works well that way as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Iv never used a cleansing water but I was very impressed with this product it helped remove dirt and oil as well as makeup I would definitely buy again also like that it is sensitive skin on mind [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Overall, I have enjoyed the Olay Water Essence. It seems to clean well. It made my skin feel a little dry, so I had to moisturize well after using. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I didn't think this would clean my skin as well as it did. I was hesitant but not only does it clean, I feel like it doesn't leave any product still on my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This has camellia oils in it so I can't use it. My bottle also smelled weird and it's not supposed to have a fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
