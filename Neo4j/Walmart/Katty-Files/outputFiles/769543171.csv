"I love this Divine Derriere Skin Lightening Hydroquinone Bleaching Cream. it helps reduce the appearance of dark spots. made with amazing ingredients that help exfoliate my skin and penetrates my skin than just hydroquinone alone. Ive tried others that don't work at all. This cream works! It has helped with my blotchy skin, dark spots. sun, spots and even my freckles. im very impressed and will continue using it. So easy to use. Apply once or twice daily. The results are amazing."
"I liked how quickly this product works. It did make my skin little sensitive after use but not too much which was unbearable and not manageable. Also, loved the easy press and dispense jar. Texture is great. A tip is to use only small amount which can be absorbed by the skin not over apply. Definitely buying it again."
"I love how well this lightening cream works. I tried it in some less noticeable areas first to make sure that if there were bad side effects I could take care of them, but after some spot testing and seeing it work perfectly, I am hooked! This lightens all the dark spots and helps my skin look much better!"
I have tried several different brands which always seemed to be greasy and terrible smell so I am very pleased with this. It goes on creamy and quickly absorbs with no smell. A big plus for me and I am hoping over time with regular use the age spots disappear too.
"I have suffered with dark spots on my face almost my whole life, and since I've been using this cream twice a day I can definitely see them fading away and it also is helping my skin to get so much softer. It hasn't caused any breakouts on my sensitive skin like most products do. It's affordable and worth every cent."
"I've only used this for two weeks only at night. I'm already noticing my sun spots and acne scars fading. It's non greasy and a little goes a long way. I use it once a day, and it has not overly dried my skin out. I���ve tried countless high end products that don't work half has good as this cream. Customer for life."
"This produt is amazing. It is great with my sensitive skin, something im usually worried about. Its light and not greasy. It worked pretty quickly and quite impressed with the results. And the press dispenser is pretty neat! Would highly recommend."
"I'm really enjoying this product. It's so smooth and silky on my face. I even love the fragrance! Although I haven't used it very long, I believe the dark spots are beginning to fade already. Great to include in my nightly routine!"
"Although my skin is extremely sensitive, this cream has not given me any irritation at all. I love the way it absorbs into my skin. I am so excited by the results so far."
This cream helped even out my skin color on my arms. I had some large very white areas. I used the cream on the skin that didn't have the white discoloration. It definitely has helped make the skin color more even
I have been using this item and I already see a difference. I am using it for my skin areas with different tones due to the sun rays. I am excited to see the big difference as I keep using it.
This stuff really works! I can finally say goodbye to the sun spots on my forehead. No more having to layer on makeup. This evened out my skin tone. I couldn't be happier.
"So far, so good. It's been only a week, and my dark spots in my elbows are dramatically lightening up!!! I'm shocked, as I have tried other brands unsuccessful. The shipping was fast!"
"I decided to purchase this lightening cream in conjunction with the lightening gel. I'm so glad I did. The skin on my face is just awful I have liver spots, dark spot and freckles. I've tried many products but none worked. This cream is powerful and after a week of used made a huge difference. It also doesn't have a bad smell and doesn't burn my skin. This works perfect in combination with the gel. So looking forward to seeing how it looks in the coming weeks."
I just recently purchased this product. in the short time I have had it I have found that it is not greasy like I have found similar products. the smell is much better that others also. my age spots also seem lighter. I would recommend this product to others.
"A very creamy not oily product works wonderfully doesn't have a bad odor smells good,I've only used a couple times but can already see a difference.. Definitely recommend this product for anyone needing to lighten freckles age spots or look younger overall"
Helps to lighten dark patches of skin on the face and neck well. After a few weeks I could see the difference. I would recommend this.
"I like this cream it makes my skin smooth and it lightens, I will continiously use this for my skin regimen."
