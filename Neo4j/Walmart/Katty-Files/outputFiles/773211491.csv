I have extremely dry skin and nothing ever completely hydrates my skin like this does. I originally bought this to see if it was like the other expensive watermelon face products and it is but for a fraction of the price. Iâve used three bottles already and I am in love!
leaves my skin glowing and feeling fantastic. it can make you a little warm tho.
"product is awful. my whole forehead broke out in hard with bumps, the ones that take forever to get rid of because there really isn't anything solid but clear liquid coming out. The bumps are hard as rocks and will not go down. I am not sensitive to much of anything either and can usually use anything. my forehead looks awful!"
