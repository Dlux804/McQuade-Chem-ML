This product glides on smoothly. A little goes a long way. I use it in the morning and at night. It does not feel sticky. There is no string fragrance.
"I am currently suffering from EXTREMELY dry skin on my face and have bought just about every dry skin product on the market to no avail. Nothing helped. I read about this face cream and since it had such a high rating, I thought I would try it. This is the most AMAZING cream I have ever used. Using this cream twice a day has almost totally eliminated my dry skin. I also mix it with my foundation and apply it to my face and it keeps my face well nourished all day. So glad I found this!!!!"
Really hydrates and moisturizes. No oily or greasy feeling. I use this during the day and the serum at night.
"It took longer to get my Drench Hyaluronic Cloud Facial Cream, but it was well worth it. It makes my skin feel like silk. You don't need very much . I just tap my finger lightly on the cream and put it on my face and neck. Best feeling every."
"I love the consistency of the cream, I only have a week using it and I feel my skin softer."
"I am new to this product, however the results are going great and have seen an improvement in my skin after the first few days."
"It feels great is it goes on and immediately thereafter. But the results are no better than using my regular Ponds dry skin cream, which is about $7-$8 for 10 oz."
"I bought this a months back, for after I finished my Clinique Moisture Surge. I finally finished it, just opened it the container for this product and found the container half-empty with two divots in it like someone took two fingers, dug out a chunk of product, and then recapped it. Never bought this product before, don't know how it's supposed to look like, so maybe I'm just being paranoid, but it certainly doesn't look like 50mLs. Bobby pin for scale. See photos attached."
Been using this exact product for years...what I received wasn't at all like I usually buy. First and last time I purchase it from Walmart.com I don't trust it and I'm concerned it's fake. Hope Walmart doesn't go down the Amazon path.
All I can say is don't waste your money. It does deliver what it promises. Best would be a drug store buy. Very disapointed
This cream spreads so easily! I only need LESS than a dime size and it covers my face and neck. It's definitely improved the health of my face
"This cream is so light and hydrating! It really is amazing! It is also not greasy, so you can easily apply make up right after! Definitely worth the splurge!"
"Great moisturizer, light weight but keeps your skin looking dewey."
best hyaluronic acid cream out there so far. skin stays moisturized for at least 6-7 hours.
I bought this cream on sale. It feels fabulous on the skin. Does not make skin oily. Worth it!
"This cream goes on so nicely. It works well. Great product, fast delivery."
very creamy and white feels like nothing on your skin soaks in immediately great deal from Walmart
