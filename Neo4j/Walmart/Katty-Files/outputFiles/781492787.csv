"in response to the 1 star ""don't buy"" review: It is not thick or sticky, so I don't know what you mean by that comment. Additionally, this is a serum, not a face wash as you commented; no wonder your face doesn't feel clean! Perhaps you are confused as to how to use the product. Check the directions for use. My experience with this product has been fantastic. Clean, fresh moisture. Long lasting. Follow with a day or night moisturizer to intensify the effects."
"I have very sensitive, oily, acne-prone skin. This serum is fantastic and I honestly notice a difference in my skin after using for just 3 weeks. My skin is smoother, my pores are clearer and I have not had any new breakouts (maybe one or two due to stress). Can't recommend this enough if you are someone who also has sensitive, acne-prone skin. I also use this with the blueberry exfoliating scrub, the green pumpkin enzyme cleanser, and the citrus day gel moisturizer. So far this routine has been effective for my skin!"
Apply as directed wait until it dries to proceed any oil serum you may like
Been using for almost 4 weeks. And it good for its price. Makes my face softer and works great with my other products. It's a little sticky tho.
Feels like your rubbing regular honey on your face. Didnt leave my face feeling clean at all and was not easily applied like most bottles of face wash it irritated my skin so bad wish i never bought this
