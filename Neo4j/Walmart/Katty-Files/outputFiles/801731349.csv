Love this product. Has helped reduce fine lines on my face. Smooth soothing texture!
Absolutely wonderful I have dry sensitive skin and I've only used 2 days and I can see and feel a difference thank you so much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great hyalauronic product that doesn't drip everywhere, it thins out once on skin and doesn't sting while using in conjunction with pure retin A."
Awesome moisture.. Can't go wrong.use it everyday for at least a week and hated running out... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Wonderful product for the cost!! I believe anyone that gives this a try will enjoy it thoroughly! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love Olay products and admittedly at times try other more expensive ones when I fall for the adds or the commercials, but I always come back to Olay and now I've learned to stay with them. This product is wonderful and has truly made my skin look healthier and younger. At 61 I truly appreciate that! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product works wonders on my wrinkles. I have used Olay face lotions since I was in my teens and now that I'm older I need it more than ever. Olay lotions have always been light and not left my skin feeling sticky or heavy and this gel is the same. I love that I have seen my wrinkles disappear. Thank you Olay for helping me defy my age!

"I like how this gel feels really soft and cool on my skin. It absorbs quickly and cleanly, and my face feels softer afterwards. It has some very key ingredients and I found the price to be right. Do all these anti-age creams work? Well, sure, my skin is more moisturized and soft and it seems like fine lines are reduced. Am I ever going to have my 20 year old skin again? Probably not. but at least I'm doing what I can and trying to be realistic."
I like olay regenerist sculpting serum more. I like the feel and the smell of it. I have been using it for 6 years. My skin looks and feels soft and smooth and healthy. It helps keep my 64 years a secret!!
Thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product for several weeks and have found that it is no better or worse than anything else I have tried. I have seen no difference between this product and several other face creams I have used in the last decade in the effect it has on my skin. It IS moisturizing but quite overpriced, considering it does not make me look any younger, as it is supposed to do (I am 58 yrs old). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product, It provides 24 hours of intense, age defying hydration for my aging dry skin. This is a lightweight product that feels really good on my skin. This facial cream keeps my skin hydrated and looking good through out the day. If you have dry aging skin I highly recommend this product for you. I'm sure you will be pleased.

"This product feels great going on and absorbs quickly leaving no residue. That said, after speaking with an Olay representative on the phone, I believe I will stick with the Regenerist Microsculpting cream (has vitamin E which this product does not) as my primary moisturizer. Suggestion was made to use it before applying the microsculpting cream which I have been doing and may continue if I see a difference with the addition. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The first thing I noticed when I opened the container was that the product was of a liquid consistency. it was off-putting and difficult to apply, but I gave it a shot. I didn't like the feel, it was not like a serum, it was like water.It didn't do anything for my skin. I am very disappointed I didn't enjoy this product, and that is didn't do anything for my skin, except dry it out. Once it dried on my face it was flaky. Maybe I received a defective produst.

"I like this product so far. I haven't used it long enough yet to be able to comment on its effectiveness, but I love how it feels on my face. It is very lightweight and absorbs right into my face. I love Olay products . Once I finish this jar I will compare the results to the Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting cream that I usually use, and then decide which to use. I definitely recommend Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product helps my skin from being too dry. It also helps my skin feel smoother and refresh. I usually have oily skin, and most moisturizer runs my make up off, but I used this instead and my make up been in place and so I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I didn't notice much of a smell different from other Olay creams.
"It was very smooth but a little bit goes a long way, in other words it is almost runny compared to night cream and total effects. I still would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is easily and quickly absorbed into the skin and is very moisturizing. I love the smell - it is fresh and clean without being overly scented. I also love the feel of this Olay product. It feels smooth, silky and feels so nice when applying it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been an Olay girl since high school. Started with the pink stuff and have never been disappointed with any product I have used. This new cream is very hydrating for my dry skin. I will purchase again ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this first on my summer hands and could certainly really see a huge difference in the hydration of my skin. When used at night I could see and feel that my skin was softer and more supple in the morning. it is slightly tacky and hard to apply foundation over, so would recommend using at night. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was a bit skeptical because at first site it looks and feels thin. Most moisturizing products are thick,heavy. I was pleasantly surprised to find how effective this ADVANCED product has been. I love the OLAY products and this one will be a keeper! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Still using this product so I can't give it 5 stars on effectiveness and value. But I can tell you that it is very light on the skin, not at all greasy, and has a pleasant smell (wish was a little lighter on the scent). I still have a lot left in the jar because you really don't need to use a lot, so it is lasting a long time. But I have noticed my skin a lot softer. So far I am liking this a lot. I will be finishing the jar and so far I would recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay has been a trusted brand name in my household for years (and my Mom's!) because they are a leader in the market place and are truely committed to testing and developing products that bring the best to us. This product is no exception. It has made my skin more supple, hydrated and has a certain glow. At my age, this is difficult to achieve, but with Olay it has happened. I will look into your other products in the Olay Age Defying ADVANCED collection. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is great because it is thick, silky, and smooth as it is applied to my face. It absorbs quickly and leaves no residue or sticky feel to it as it instantly dries. I can apply my Olay CC cream right away for a fresh weekend look without a lot of effort. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product feels so light on your skin not the least bit sticky compared to other gels I've tried. I do like that it keeps my skin feeling soft and moisturized throughout the day but can't say I've noticed a glow. For the price point it's definitely worth the money and will probably continue using during the day but not ready to leave my Olay regenerist behind. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Glides on smoothly. Good moisturizer, stays on all day. It feels light, not greasy. It is in a handy jar rather than a tube. Because it is a gel cream it will apply easily. Does not clog pores. It works well in hot humid weather condiions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I personally noticed a difference in my skin overnight.
"I also put it on my chest below my neck. Felt soothing as soon as it touches your skin. I presently use Olay Regenerist micro sculpting cream. I love that too! However, Hydrating Gel cream moisturizer has a different feel. Like moisturizing with a cool cream. Very hydrating, indeed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Will continue to use in am & pm and in between times.
"This has become my favorite drug store gel mousturizer. It's light, refreshing, great for my oily skin AND wears well under makeup!"
"Bought this after loving the spf 15 in this new line. Moisturizing, soothing and non irritating. Makes pores look smaller and skin look younger. Perfect moisture balance and great addition to Olay lines. Skin is glowing! Thank you Olay!"
"It's my new go to daily moisturizer! This product feels great on my skin and absorbs quickly. It doesn't leave you feeling sticky, just moisturized. It also has a wonderful fragrance! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
