"This review is a long time coming! I've been using this product daily since I was 28. I am now 43 and still have youthful, supple skin and am always told I don't look even close to my age. I attribute a lot of that to this cream and its sun protection. It sinks in quickly, keeps my skin hydrated, is a great base for my makeup and never has been oily on me. Please never stop making this!"
"I've been using this moisturizer for over a month and I am blown away. It does exactly what it says it'll do. I love how plump and moisturized my skin is after applying it, I also love that it doesn't leave a white cast as some moisturizers do when they have sunscreen."
"I love this moisturizer and am having a hard time finding it lately. I fear it being discontinued. Please no! This formula WITHOUT SPF is perfect and just soaks right in to my freshly cleaned face every morning. I found that the Olay Total Effects with SPF did not allow my makeup foundation to apply well. I can use this one even around my eyes, and then a primer and foundation both with spf protection so my skin is safe. This formula really lifts my face in a noticeable way. Others do not."
"I have strayed from Olay 7 once or twice by the promise of something better, but I have always come back to Olay 7 because it delivers. I am 50 and not here to toot my own horn, but I get compliments on my skin regularly and I would have to give credit to sunblock and Olay 7. Looking like you're in your thirties when your fifty is a great feeling. I don't find this product greasy, the smell is clean and light and a little goes a long way. For the money, this is, hands down, one of THE best moisturizers I have ever used."
"I've used Oil of Olay for 40 years. I started using it because it was pink and sounded exotic. I kept using it because it made my skin feel like silk and I wont give it up now because I'm 53 and I look good. No, I look great. almost wrinkle free and glow, glow ,glow ,glow."
"I am about to turn 50 in January and it is currently November. Needless to say I've tried my fair share of moisturizers!! This one has been by far 100% better than all of the previous ones I've used in the past. The non-greasy, fast absorbing moisturizer has the best results ever. The overall brightness and pore reducing looks have allowed me to forgo any cover up, foundation, or powder! I've reduced my makeup bag by removing three products!"
"I am 21 years old and have battled with dry skin for as long as i can remember. I received this moisturizer as a gift and it has changed my skin. I no longer have acne, my face is incredibly smooth and it feels great!"
"I love this product, it is my favorite moisturizer by far. I have tried many but this one works best for me and doesn't have a heavy feeling when applied. Also doesn't clog my pores. Easy to apply, fantastic pump bottle and doesn't take a lot to cover completely."
I usually never write reviews about products but i had to for this product I had uneven sun tan on my nose from my glasses and i hated how it looked so I decided to try this product and my skin is already starting to show evenness all over after only using it for 3 days!!! I dab a little under my eyes every morning and night and I dont even wake up with bags as bad as i did this product really does what it says
I use this a lot and love it put it on after shower or before applying makeup
"I loved total effects anti aging/ anti blemish product, which is no longer available. So the web site told me if i loved that product, then i would love the total effects daily moisturizer..... The scent is overwhelming!!! I am very sensitive to fragrance, and had to wash it off immediately. Olay, please bring back the anti aging/ anti blemish product!!!!!!!!"
"Using Oil of Olay since I was 20 has helped me with my aging process. I am often thought to be much younger than I am. It is a wonderful product that does not clug pores. It is very important to people with sensitive, or dry skin and moisturizes your skin for hours, and never greasey . Will not stain clothing and makes you look young and viberant."
"I like Olay Total Effects moisturizer. It blends well with my natural skin tone and has helped the overall appearance of my skin. The problem is the packaging. Sometimes it blobs out and there is no way to ""put it back."" There is no way of telling that it is almost gone and there is no warning that you are running low. So, this morning, I'll be going to work with no foundation."
I have a problem with brown spots and uneven color. Total effects has minimized both. I am very pleased and will let others know.
When I use this moisturizer you can almost hear my skin go Ahhhhh! It feels so great when it goes on and I love the nongreasy feel that it leaves on my skin. My makeup goes on flwlessly after I use this moisturizer.
"This worked really well under makeup and as a night cream. It helped the appeareance of wrinkles, especially the crow's feet around the eyes. I would highly recommend it."
"I use a 2 serums and 2 creams from the department store! I have used this off and on but today I made the switch. I want something fast and easy that does what it says. It does take the place of serums, treatments etc. Will be using this for a long time!"
"I have used Total Effects Moisturizer for two days. I am 59 years old and have used very expensive brands in the past. This product is a fresh breath of air. Puffiness 50% gone. Skin tone and texture perfect. Correct amount of moisture-giving properties. The old saying, ""less is more"" is totally true with this product."
"I asked my mom for this at Xmas as well as other Olay products, she's used Olay since I was a little girl, I'm 44 now...I absolutely love this product! I've always had uneven skin color since I was young, I've used it daily for two weeks and I'm using less foundation and noticed even without makeup my skin tone is more balanced! Id recommend this product to anyone with uneven skin tones! It works and it's not greasy...goes on smooth and does what it says! Try it, you won't be disappointed! Worth every prnny"
"I have used Olay since I was 23; the original pink and other Olay moisturizers in between. Since using Total Effects, it has been my #1 choice for morning and night. Throughout the years, people I see day to day and people that haven't seen me for years always say "" you always look the same, your skin is flawless!""... my answer always ...""OLAY!"""
"After ending chemotherapy my skin was extremely dry and nothing seemed to work. I started using the Olay Total Effects 7 fragrance free and just after one application i noticed a big difference on my skin appearance. My skin looks much better and healthy now. I found what I needed, Thanks!!!"
"I am a middle aged woman and I found it did not help with my skin dryness. So, I will be going back to a moisturizer that works better."
Just started using this. Thrilled with the results and the feel on my face it gives. Like silk and doesn't feel greasy at all.
"i have been using olay since i was 20 years old . i have tried several different products and nothing worked for me like olay. no one cao ever guess my age, so thats why i stuck to olay, i called it my baby. thank you olay. ilove you."
Product very effective at doing what it says it will do - reduce the 7 signs of aging. Noticed my skin looked brighter...better. Worth the money spent!
"I use a lot of Olay products but I am very disappointed in Olay Total Effects. I don't like the way it feels on my skin. It's heavy and greasy and makes my hands feel dirty. I'm willing to put up with having to wash my hands if I saw results, but I saw no visibleresults"

"I've been using it since i was 20 and now i am 22 and it is amazing, it smells nice and works effectivley , but i don't like its texture i think it is little bit thick i prefer gel-like texture , and i had a concerns latelly about the suitable age , should i use an anti aging product while i am still 22 ? And if not what is the suitable age ?"
"The New packaging of your product is horrible it leaves black paint on my face, the shower walls, my towel and everywhere, this lousy packaging dissolves in the shower where most people keep their facial wash! I love your product but this new packaging really makes me want to dump it!"
"These were the first cleanser that ever worked for me, I have very sensitive skin and always had to trade off between having clear looking skin that quickly got too dry or skin that never looked clear. The cleansing cloths were wonderful and my heart is broken that they've gone the way of the dodo. Why oh why?"
"Does Olay still make the 7-in-1 Cleansing Cloths? I received some over 15 years ago as a sample and have used them ever since. They work wonders on my skin for age spots, smoothness, vibrancy, etc. I am having trouble finding them in stores. Please let me know if you still make them, and if so, where i can purchase them. Love the product and live in fear they won't be available anymore! Please help!"
I am in my 30's and still have combination skin but also skin sensitivity. This product is the only one I can use morning and night and it doesn't make me break out and it doesn't leave my skin feeling oily and it makes my skin feel soft and not dry or tight. I find it's a perfect consistency and I wouldn't want it any other way
I used Lanc√¥me for many years and my skin was not showing any improvement. I started using this product by oil of Olay total effect and in one week my skin looks and feels healthier. I will stick with this product and put my left over money from those expensive mall stores in savings. I'm very happy with results.
I have been using Olay since I was 15 years old and Olay Complete is my lotion of choice. I decided to try something different now that I am older (I won't say how much older!) and my skin has changed a bit. But I am not a fan of this product. It feels very cakey and sticky on my face. You have to be careful not to rub it on too much or it will clump up. It feels like it is sitting on my skin instead of soaking in. I will stick with my Olay Complete!
"I used this product for several years, and stopped for 6 months to try a high dollar product from the expensive department store at the mall. Well - I""m back! And so glad I am. My skin looks awesome and feels amazing. A man stopped me at Costco, and said my wife wants to know what you use on your face...!!!! Yes! It works for me!! Oh and I don't wear coverup."
"I was waiting for long time to try this product which was recommended by a friend who tried it. I cannot feel any good change. The pores looks wider , skin tone is much more uneven, no renewal or exfoliation. feels sticky, smelly and shiny. I tried much better and cheaper skin products of natural origin that gives wonderful effects within couple of days of use. I am disappointed because I expected more from a well-known brand like Olay. I am returning it."
"If this product is oil free, why doesn't it say so on the product container? Is it oil free? or non-pore clogging (can't remember the phrase)? l used the 1.7 oz moisturizer, didn't buy again. Don't really remember why, maybe the cost or maybe blackheads came back. I can ONLY use oil free products. I hope this is, if so I will buy it again."
I was very excited to try this because I've always liked other Olay products. What a disappointment! The first time I put it on my face I wound up washing it off within an hour because it made my face feel uncomfortably tight and sticky. Today just tried it on my neck and chest and as soon as I'm done writing this I will go and wash it off for the same reasons. Would not recommend this product.
"I've been on Oil of Olay since I was young. Even thought I will be ""48"" this year, I look like I'm in my mid ""30's"". I have oily skin, which can be a real struggle. I use this as my morning routine with my Oil of Olay facial wash. Face, neck, and chest area. The neck and chest age as well."
"I tried the trial size first & got hooked almost immediately. It only takes a few days to notice the effectiveness of this product. My skin is smoother, brighter, more moisturized & overall better. I have incredibly sensitive skin & I tolerate this product very well."
"Without hesitation, I purchased I gave this a try. I use OLAY soaps in my daily routine and I have never been disappointed. I have been using this product for over a week now and my face has gotten so dry. I do struggle with combination skin, but this has not helped in the slightest. I have even felt a slight stinging feeling when applying the moisturizer. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I am beyond disappointed."
"I'm always on the look out for moisturizer that feels great on my skin, is lightly perfumed, and actually makes my skin feel wonderful. I tried the sample size and I'm back to buy the larger size. :D I rarely leave ratings, but this one deserves it. It's like a mid-weight cream and applies smoothly. After application...omg, my face feels fantastic. Smooth, non-greasy. It doesn't feel heavy and feels like a much more expensive cream. Try it. :D"
"I have been using this product every morning for the past 11 years! There was once that I went two weeks without it, I will NEVER do that again. I could absolutely tell a difference in my skins appearance. I get complemented on how young I look ALL the time. ( I'm 41). It is a bit expensive, however it last me for about 3 months per bottle."
"It feels and smells great.I liked using it every day. The value is exceptional.I would recommend it and plan to keep using Olay products. This cream does what it advertises.This cream is the best. Very ,very VERY GOOD .IT HAS MANY beneficial QUALITIES.I REALLY LIKED IT."
It is a good product but not for everyone. It is to heavy for some and you don't have enough information about the product before you buy to know this. Olay is a good company I just feel that it is very difficult to decide which one of there face lotions to use.
This would be the seventh year that I did not change my moisturizer because this works for my Asian sensitive brown skin. I've tried many moisturizers out there and I am happy that I found the one that matches my skin needs. The only reason for the 4 as overall rating is the price.
"I have used all of the Olay products! Including the make up. It is all so wonderful. It really does exactly what it says it does. Makes your skin look younger, and soft, makes fine lines disappear. I would never buy anything else!!! More expensive products don't hold a candle to the superb performance of Olay Total Effects, and yes it smells wonderful, but how it makes you look, amazing!"
I've been using Olay products for years now & get compliments. Turned many friends onto it. When I couldn't afford it I noticed a huge difference!!! Now I scrafice to keep Olay always! Stocked up so I wouldn't run out! Also I've sensitive skin & Olay is all I can use. Just love their products!!!
Leaves you skin soft a smooth helps wrinkles.The product smells refreshing and leaves you face feeling silky smooth. Great base for makeup because of the silky-smooth texture it makes your skin your makeup goes on to easy and last all day. Oil of play has been scientifically prove to be the best skin products over more expensive brands.
"Mom has used this moisturizer for years! I tried introducing her to more expensive brands, but she always goes back to this one. It doesn't break out her face like some other ones she's tried. It smells good and it's light weight. Oh, and her face looks great too=)"
This product is the best on the market. After you apply it your skin absorbs it almost immediately and the effects after it has soaked in are amazing. I would recommend this product highly to females as well as males. They do have the unscented form of this product for the men. Please do not ever stop making this product.
The Total Effects Daily Face Moisturizer is the only moisturizer I use day or night. My sometimes sensitive skin has never reacted when I have used Total Effects Daily Face Moisturizer it has only gotten better. The moisturizer absorbs quickly and often it is the only thing that goes on my face so I am make up free on the week ends.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love all olay products, have used them for years and would recommend any without hesitation. I use total effects daily moisturizer in the morning, after washing my face, and in the evening, again after washing my face. It leaves a refreshing feel,touch to my skin. Truly, a great product!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for many years and I stopped using it for a while and I noticed my skin drying out. I then started using it again and now my skin is soft and people don't believe I'm in my 50's Love the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's wonderful. I want more. I don't know what I'd do without it. Every day I automatically moisturize with it and voila my face already feels better. I love this product so much, it's the most important product in my vanity! Thank you for the results Olay! !! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The lovely scent and silky feeling will encourage you to put this wonderful moisturizer all over your body. But just a little will cover your whole face and make you feel like you have had an amazing facial. The moisturizer quickly disappears into your skin leaving a silky soft feeling that lasts a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I get this and then put a SPF 30 sunscreen over it rather than to get a SPF 15 because I alreasdy have some sun damage spots from when I was younger and used no sunscreen at all. I like a good product next to my skin (Olay) and to put the sunscreen over it so the main product in contact with my skin is the moisturizer. I would use an SPF 15 if I wore facial powder or foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Have Used this produce daily for over 10 years. Also tried other creams that are more expensive and have not gotten the same results I always keep the Olay daily and mature cream as part of my regular routine for my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Years ago I came across a Good Housekeeping product review at a time when I was looking for a good moisturizer. The product was Total Effects. I tried it and I have been using it ever since. If you want a good moisturizer that not only does what it promises but is also a good value for your money this is it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After years and years of trying anything and everything advertised to even skin tone, I decided to try Total Effects 7 CC Creme. This product is the only one I have tried that actually works. Within the first week I saw a difference in skin tone and texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using The Daily Moisturizer for several months and really like the results. Very light and helps my liquid makeup to spread well. I am 60+ years old and have used many, many different moisturizers. I love this and will continue to use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really love this product, it leaves my face smooth and refreshed. I would highly refer this to all friends and family. The cost is also a plus factor. all products from this line are great for woman of any age who like to keep their skin in great condition. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I live on the coast of the Southeast U.S., which tends to be both hot and humid, especially during the summer months. Finding a moisturizer that will work both to hydrate my skin and protect it from sun damage without feeling and looking greasy is a challenge, but this is that product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Total Effects has been a very good product for me. I realized I needed something more so I have moved to the Regenerist Line. I like the way the moisturizer comes out of the top but would the scent of the Effects line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am 64 years old. I have been using Total Effects face moisturizer for a few months and it is super. My face has never looked as great as it does now. My skin is so soft. Even my husband has remarked how great my face looks. I am lucky and have only a few lines on my face. I am sure it is due to using Total Effects daily. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used this product for two weeks and with one wash and a small amount was enough to clean my face I wear foundation almost everyday using fit 355 and that is for dark skin.and this product does the job. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used many moisturizers trying to find the right one. This product has proven to work!! It soaks into the skin quickly so if you need to use foundation, you can do so quickly. Skin stays moisturized for a long time. It is also very affordable. Affordable and works is a winning combination! I would recommend that everyone give it a try. It will not disappoint. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got a jar of Total Effects Daily Moisturizer, thinking ok, I like the brand, but didn't expect to see such dramatic results. Working nights, often operating on not enough sleep. Diet not always at it's best, mostly grab what is handy. I noticed a difference after about a week, Makes me think I need to be a little more aggressive with my skin care! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product goes on so easy! It soaks in as soon as it is applied! I can feel that is is moisturizing immediately! I used to use a primer before I put on my make up but I do not have to when I use this product, I would recommend it to everyone. It is also affordable! Try it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Being a ""Sensitive Skin Gal"" I was very hesitant to try this moisturizer. I love it. A little goes a long way! The moisturizer does not feel greasy or heavy. My make up goes on perfectly. I don't have breakouts or dry /greasy patches in any area...just a smooth, soft feel. My skin feels very ourished and loved. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for many years and it has left my skin so soft and smooth. People cannot guess my correct age. I do try to stay out of the sun as much as possible now that I am older but that wasn't always true in my younger years - out in the boat, water skiing, dirt bike riding, etc., but like I said I have used this product for years. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
my mother used it as I grew up and I have used it all my adult life. No one believes I am 82 years and I believe my use of your products has helped that. I use it everyday and would not go out without my Moisturizer [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried all the expensive and inexpensive moisturizers and always come back to this. I have used it for years....I turned 60 last month and no one can believe it. I do not have wrinkles. I intend to continue not looking my age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Every morning is like a fresh start for my skin. After applying this moisturizer my skin feels younger, smoother and softer. This product has the ability to refresh and replenish my skin, making it feel more elastic and younger to the touch and look. With a routine of cleansing and moisturizing, I have found the fountain of youth! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been faithful to olay products my whole adult life ( lookin at 50 people) I have nice, not perfect but nice skin. I have never used or even considered using other products. I've always used basic age defying but recently started using total effects. I see increased smoothness. No miracles just good skin. Thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the Total Effects to moisturize my skin because it looked tired... After just one use, I was complimented on my skin. I didn't realize it would make such a difference, but it really did. I'm kinda sold on this product. Thanks so much. Your company keeps us ladies feeling good... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am older than most of Olay customers..Still looking for the right products for older skin. This is not bad. If you come up with older skin care, call me to try out your new products You will be the 1st to care and it would be a open market. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried many different moisturizers but none of them were as good as Olay. Olay is priced more reasonably than other products and works better than the more expensive products. I have used your products for many years and am often told that I don' look like I am almost 63 years old. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product for 3 months and am so happy. The product moisturizes my dry skin and I feel my face is so soft and looks radiant. I especially like that it absorbs with no greasy feel and smells so nice. I am sold on this product and will continue to use it . I have finally found a product that pleases me immensely. Thank You [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the way my skin feels each day and I have noticed a change in my complexion since I have started using this product, less dullness and I do not see fine lines or wrinkles as much. I have received compliments on my skin from my family and friends, and I have recommended this product to family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've always taken care of my skin, but my 62-year old skin had become dull and old. I began using Total Effects Daily Face Moisturizer and within a week or so I noticed that it became more subtle and radiant. Thank you - the glow is returning to my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried this product for the first time at the beginning of the year when I was out of my regular moisture lotion. I wasn't sure how much I was going to like it compared to what I was using and was pleasantly surprised how well it worked. It went on smooth and kept me feeling hydrated all day long without a greasy feeling. I am now using this as my regular moisture lotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used this product for awhile it always makes my face younger and full of moisture that softens the skin almost instantly. I've used under makeup and found that prolonged the stay of the makeup. I use just my skin feels tight and dry and it instantly makes it feel better. It also makes the wrinkles seem less defined. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Total Effects Daily Face Moisturizer is just WONDERFUL! I noticed results right away by just using it the first time. It will make your skin super smooth and moisturized without being greasy. It is light weight on your skin and has a pleasant smell. I've tried a lot of moisturizers over the years and I have to say that this is the best one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried a few different brands over the years but I keep coming back to the Total Effects. It doesn't feel heavy or greasy and when used consistently it works great on dryness and fine wrinkles.Some people have said hat you have to switch moisturizers for different times of the year summer/winter but not when you use Total Effects I like how it feels and what it does all year long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for the last few years, and I totally love this product, I can see a dramatic difference in my fine lines around my eyes and mouth. Everyone says that I look like I am in my late 20's when I am actually 35 years old this year. I cannot say enough great things about this product I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It moisturizes your skin and didnt leave my skin oily or dry. You can use it morning and at night. it leaves you skin so ft and smooth. It makes my wrinkles look less noticeable. It also has sun screen for my fair skin. It also replaces any other moisturizers i use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this moisturizer. I use it daily and the longer I use it the more I see improvement. I also use the night cream as well, as the BBC cream. I have recommended and brought Oil f OlayOil for both of my daughters. I can also see a a huge difference in their complexion...I proudly promote ""oil of Olay"" all the time.

"Before I used the daily moisturizer my skin was dry and cracked my the end of the day. Now, my skin is much smoother and others have noticed. I am 62 years old and a registered nurse. I work long hours. I apply the Total Effects moisturizer before I put on my makeup, and my skin is smooth for 12+ hours! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've tried everything , and nothing works as good as this product. I was totally amassed , it's not that expensive , you will be purprised when you start seeing results. And in about a month or less you will start seeing results, depending on which one you get. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Amazing product! My mum has always used Olay products and when i was about 6 or so i asked what she was putting on her face and she said Olay, so now im her age at the time of my asking and i couldn't be happier with my results, Face feels hydrated, soft and more youthful in appearance! Love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am 84 years old and have been using this product for many years. I love it. It makes my face smooth hardly any wrinkles. I am never taken for my age. Everyone wants to know what I do to look so young and have such lovely skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'll be turning 53 this November. I use Total Effects day cream daily. It makes my face soft, brilliant and most especially free of wrinkles, that's why it makes me feel and look younger than my actual age. I wash my face with Olay facial cleanser before applying Total Effects Day cream and before bedtime. Even my two daughters in their 20's are now using Olay products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Total Effects Daily Face Moisturizer is such a pleasure to use daily! It is soft and silky and leaves my skin feeling that way! I feel like this moisturizer erases lines and continues to make my aging skin look young and vibrant! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product. I use it under my foundation or sometimes alone to moisturize. The overall effects are amazing. Within the first few days I noticed a change in the appearance of my skin. Within a few weeks the small lines seem to disappear. This product is not to oily for my combination skin. It leaves my face and neck area very smooth.

"Total Effects Moisturizer is the best Anti-aging lotion ever available . People always ask me what product I am using when they find out my daughter is not my "" sister"", as they thought.

"I have been using Olay products since I was in my 20s and I'm now almost 50. I get told over and over again how young I look and although I have good genes, I truly believe using Olay Total Effects Daily Face Moisturizer and the other Olay products has kept my skin looking the youngest it can possibly look. This is a great product and makes my skin feel moisturized and soft. I would recommend it to anyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Not oily. Leaves my face smooth and softer looking. Just what was needed for someone resisting using an ""anti aging"" (ugg) regimen. Anti aging is what's needed after a certain age, or maybe any age. The great outcome from this product made accepting the inevitable acceptable. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love applying Total Effects each morning after my shower. It locks in the moisture and makes my face feel wonderfully hydrated without being greasy. It also has some SPF which is great for my fair skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I enjoy using this product because you can feel it work once you apply it to you face and neck. It tingles your skin and pulls in the moisture to your pours. The look and feel of you skin is delightful. It also contains sun screen to help protect you skin from harmful sun rays. It is valuable product to add to your morning and evening regime.

"I went to the store to get this product because I had seen in an advertisement that the sunscreen in it was SPF 30, but that is a similar product and not this same one. This only has SPF 15. I was disappointed because the store only carried this one. I think they should all be at least 30 SPF. Otherwise, I am a faithful Olay user."
I have used many different moisturizers and this BY FAR is the best. I have combination skin oily around my noise and dry in the t zone. But this face lotion works PERFECT. Its also helped with my breakouts I literally don't breakout anymore. I'm so happy with this product and I'll continue to buy it. 100% worth the cost.
I have used regular Olay until I started noticing that I was developing some dark age spots on my checks. Probably from excessive tanning when I was younger. So I switch to Total Effects. It has brightened my overall appearance and lightens the dark areas. It feels so light and soft. I just love it. I am 62 and people always tell me that I can only be early 50s.
"I have been using this product for about 3 to 4 years now. I can't rave enough about it. I am not one to use a moisturizer but I started using bare minerals makeup and didn't really like the moisturizer that came with the kit. I chose this one and fell in love. Since I have been using this product I rarely even wear any foundation because my skin is so clear and young looking. I love love love it!! Makes my face feel soft, clean and not heavy!!"
"I have used Regular Oil of Olay Products for years, and have great skin because of it. I just bought/used the Total Effects Products and am amazed that in just 24 hours I am seeing and feeling an improvement in my dry skin on both my face and arms. I am really Glad! that I changed to this set of products. I don't think my skin could get better, but it did. :)"
Received this for my 30th birthday as my first piece of the Total Effects line. Once I got used to the pump product was easy to dispense. A little goes a long way. Has a pleasant smell. I use acne products as well and they dry my skin. Due to this I need a little more moisture than this product can provide. This product did not improve the overall texture of my skin.
"I have used Olay products since I was a teenager. For the past few years, I used Olay Definity and LOVED it. After it was discontinued, I was told to that Olay Total Effects was a good substitute. There's no comparison. Total Effects is greasy and never absorbs into my skin. By the end of the day, even my bangs are dripping oil. Bring back Definity!!!!"
I am 19 years old and i bought this product last night and after washing my face i put it on. I was seeking for some reviews to see if i actually made the right choose and to see if this was going to help reduce my main problem which is enlarged pores and uneven skin tone. After reading some of the reviews i have seen here i do think this product will help me. After one use i can tell that my face feels softer. I will come back in the following weeks and review this product again to see if it actually worked on me.
"I bought this product because of the good reviews it had, and I have to tell you guys it really does work! I am only 19 but just within the last 4 days of using this product in the mornings and evenings I can tell a difference.My mom had asked if I had foundation on today, when I didn't! It helped lighten some of the red spots on my skin, and it is not oily. I went and bought the body wash and foaming face wash today that go with this line! Will be leaving reviews about those also!"
"I've been using Total Effects for the last 8 years or so, and choosing to spend a little more for my face lotion was one of the best decisions I ever made. I'm 28, but people consistently confuse me for being 20 because my skin looks so young! I would strongly recommend this to anyone looking for a high quality, effective facial lotion."
I have used nivea for 34 years and to even try oil of olay was a challenge for me but after using the regenerist nite and the night of olay i am very happy with the results from the last 6 months even though it hasnt reversed the ageing process i feel it has slowed it down considerably so i am off to buy the total effects right now
"This is a great daily moisturizer! I saw difference in my skin after just a few weeks! My skin is much more hydrated, even and much more firm. It absolutely dose what it says. My only major problem with the total effects line is that there isn't enough SPF!! So I still need to put sunscreen on with my moisturizer. Please Olay make a total effects moisturizer with SPF 30!!! Please."
"i have never been one to believe much in any skin care product, but this one changed my mind. A friend recommended this moisturizer and I can see and feel a huge difference in my skin, especially in the mornings which is the hardest time to look in the mirror! I will continue to try other products in this line and tell other friends. fantastic. thank you."
"many years ago, i recieved a sample of total effects moisturizer in the mail. i had never used a moisturizer before. after trying the sample, i have been using it ever since. i absolutely love it. it makes my face feel so soft. it doesn't feel greasy like some products tend to do. i can't live without it."
"I'm a college student and I am still getting out of my ""teen"" skin. I have oily skin and most moisturizers break me out easily or cause my skin to look oily. This did neither. It goes on beautifully and the smell is great. It absorbs quickly. I wake up and notice my skin is smooth and brighter than before. I doubt I will ever stop buying this product!!"
"before using olay total effects is a product which works like magic due to pollution & thyroid facial skin become so dried that even if i apply any moisturizer it was o no use then i came to know about this cream & now my skin is glowwy,soft & healthier than early i had.I have stopped using all other products not even feels to go for facial as i also use olay total effects anti-agieng cream.Thanx to olay as it gave me my glowing & wonderful looking skin back."
The very first use left my skin glowing. Did not like the dispenser because it pumps too much product out if you forget to gently tap it. I gently tap product into skin after wash skin and my skin feels like velvet and glows - no matter how much sleep I had- I get compliments on how great my face skin looks.
"I first became a user of Olay products in 2008. I work outside, without a hat and had noticed that my skin was becoming dry, scaly, with patchy brown spots. I first tried the Regenerist Daily Regenerating Serum and really noticed a difference right a away. I knew it was working when my co-workers wanted to know what I had done. I then returned to Walmart and began to look at Olays other products and purchased the Olay Total Effects. I am very happy with both products and will continue to use. Thank You."
"I love this lotion, it comes out of the pump smoothly and has a soft, clean smell to it. It's perfect for my morning routine, I like knowing that it has sunscreen in it to protect my fair skin! I constantly get compliments on how beautiful my skin is, and I'm sure it's because I've been using Olay all my life."
"I have been using this product & many other Olay products for years. this particular pump, I was daily, Before I apply my make-up. It makes my skin soft & revived. I would recommend this product to everyone & have got my mom started using it as well. I will not use anything else."
"I've beeen faithful To ""Total Effects Daily Moisturizer"" since it first came on the market. I have tried other products, but I always return to ""Total Effects"". My skin ""falls apart"" in a day without it. I can't live without it. I would need a whole line of another product to even come close to getting the results I get in one little bottle of ""Total Effects Daily Moisturizer"". Consistently great results!"
Happy. My purchase from Walmart was less than Amazon!
"Why did you remove spf 15 option? This was the only moisturizer with sunscreen which didn't aggravate my rosacea. Bring it back, please!!!!"
i tryed this was not the one i8 usually use serium 7 for three hours my eyes teared and wart ered and burned. i would not buy this product again.
Cream makes the skin really soft but I feel like it's way to thick. A tiny bit goes a very long way which I like. It smells really good. I put mine on every morning and I feel it Ives me the awake look and brightens my skin.
"Product feels greasy, and the promise of ""luminous 20-something skin"" just doesn't materialize. I think DNA has more to do with the results than this poorly formulated cream."
"And I would like to stay that way. This product is clearly made for a totally different demo than myself. Great value for those who are transitioning, however for those who like who they are- not the right fit."
"I always had dry skin and I would try different types of lotions and I didn't really liked any of them until I saw this one. It's so smooth, keeps your skin soft. Plus it smells good too"
I love iteveryone should try this it's great I love this product it makes you look younger it took away all my wrinkles everybody is amazed about how I look and I looked to be about 15 years younger
"Best product out on the shelves available at any pharmacy in your neighborhood, I would recommend this to anyone that uses Olay products . It is really amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
This product smells amazing.This product smells amazing.This product smells amazing.This product smells amazing.This product smells amazing.This product smells amazing.This product smells amazing.
I think all of them work amazing. I use multiple of the products. I don't buy any other products for my face. I use and people notice so I tell them about them. I think the price are pretty reasonable. Worth paying a little more for the products.
"this product is A1! ( yells ) whole lot of amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing amazing gr8 gr8 gr8 awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome as ever , blesseth the heart that came up with this product !"
"Used for years and had great skin results in softening, moisturizing, and even tone with affordable cost and saving comparable to other products available. Smell of product is not overwhelming and very tolerant."
Olay Total Effects makes me look 10 years younger! I don't want to face a day without it. A young top supermodel (in the hospital) once told me she cries too without it! I shared some of mine.
"The best ever I couldn't have got my skin back to normal without it. Why didn't someone tell me about Olay before, I feel so late on the matter right now."
Left me smooth and soft and now my skin feels so nice. Ladies if you have a date or a special someone I totally recommend this cause it makes you look a lot younger when you need it ya old farts.
"I've only been using this product a short time, however, I absolutely love it. I love the smell, I love how it feels when I'm putting the lotion on. It's like putting cashmere on my face."
"Use this product all of the time, it works for me i can see a difference when i didn't use it so went back to using and thats how i know it works for me . i love and recommend it."
"Make my skin looks perfect, i have a sensitive so is difficult for me to find a product who don't make any damage to my skin, and i find this. I try Olay before with a exfoliating cream i was good, so i take the risk with this and i just love it"
By far the best product for moisturizing and daily use. Use This in the A.M. and use the night cream for the evening. You will wake up look in the mirror and your face will glow and smile back. 10 out of 10!
"I have been using Olay products, off and on since my teens. I recently purchased Total Effects anti-Aging Moisturizer and I love it! My skin feels much smoother. It absorbs quickly without a greasy feeling."

"I've been using this product for a week and have already noticed a difference. My skin is clearer, brighter and fresh looking. I can't wait to try other products from this line."
I've been using OLTE for about two months and my skin looks great. My pores are smaller and redness has disappeared! I love this product! Thanks olay!
"I have used alot of different facial products and so far, Olay wins.....I love the Total Effects Daily Moisturizer...I do not wear cover up so, I like the glow that this product gives to my face!!!!I do tell people what I use, so they can try it."
"I can see a big different on the 2nd day using it. My face just glow when I looked in the mirror in the morning. I have tried other lines like Regenerist & Definity, but only Total Effects give distinguish improved look."
I have used the entire product line of Total Effects and it's wonderful! I am looking foward to starting the Regenerist Line very soon! I LOVE OIL OF OLAY AND WILL USE IT UNTIL THEY DON'T MAKE IT FOR MY AGE ANYMORE!!!
This daily Moisturizer does exactly what it says it will do. I have never been disappointed in an Olay Product. I will continue using this line of facial products.
"This is a very soothing face cream. I found it extremely soothing to the touch. It does have a slightly strong scent, though, so get the unscented if you're sensitive to scents. Thanks again OLAY!"
I use it every day in the morning & I love the cleanliness of my face. I have a great complexion or so I have been told. Great product & value for the money.
"This is the one moisterizer that I have used that really does what it says. It smells good, it goes on evenly and doesn't feel oily. It doesn't break out my skin, even in the summer. Awesome value also."
"This worked really well under makeup in the mornings and at night on a clean face. It helped the appearance of wrinkles, especially the around my eyes and mouth. I would highly recommend it."
I have been using this procuct for several years. I have totally enjoyed using this product because it is right for my skin and makes the lines on my face almost invisible.
I have combination skin and seem to break out when using various products of various quality. I usually use dermalogica (high end product) and this is a great affordable alternative to their facial lotion.
I absolutely love this product! I have sensitive skin & have used this for years with no problems- no burning sensation that other products cause. Definately worth the purchase!
"I love it! It goes on smooth, feels cool on my skin, and doesn't leave me feeling like I'm suffocating under a heavy cream. Soft skin without a greasy shine."
I love this mositurizer. I have used this product for almost 2 years now and I will never change. My skins is so soft and smooth. I keep getting compliments on how young I look.
This is a great moisturizer; I have recently switched back to using this brand after running out of a much more expensive brand and I have to say that I think that it actually works better and I feel that it penetrates into my skin faster as well!
"This moisturizer is the best! My skin used to be so dry and flaky, now it is smooth and silky. My husband has noticed too! He never notices anything! My wrinkles seem less noticeable too."
I really like Total Effects Daily Moisturizer. I am 42 with dry skin and my skin has never felt smoother or more supple. I find all Olay products to be as good as or better than high-end department store products.
Thanks to Total Effects Daily Moisturizer for making my skin softer and younger looking. I work with college students who don't believe my age. I'm told I look 5-7 years younger.
I have tried other moisturizers with UV protection but they seem to irritate my eyes. I like the protection it gives me without burning my eyes. I know I can rely on it each day.
I live in a very dry climate and need all the moisture I can get. I love using this because it keeps my skin from flaking and I dont break out as much as I did. all in all a great product
I have just recently started using the Total Effect 7in1 moisturizer. The product seems to be working good but I do not like the container it's in. It's a push top and it's uncontrollable. It only take a tiny bit for each area of the face but sometimes it squirts out way too much. I wish Olay would find a more dependable container for this product.
"I've been using this product for a month now. I see no signs of improvement. This product is expensive. I've used other products that have worked much better. But I trusted Olay. I will never buy this particular product again. Maybe I should have tried another type of Olay, but I can't afford the price. Thank You."
Great moisturizer- without feeling greasy!! and has the added bonus of SPF
A great moisturizing product but doesnot really reduce wrinkles.
This is my absolute favorite moisturizer. It is inexpensive and excellent!
"This olay product work the first day I use it ...thank God for olay my facial skin is better , I'll be using this product for eternity !!!!"
"I am more confident since using this product, i am simply beautiful and i am using this to my full advantage. Thank you"
Awesome product I think u should buy this amazing product because it smells and feels amazing and it makes your skin feel very hydrated
It does what it intends to do I would buy again would tell my friends and family to buy this product great for the skin and comfortable.
I like the brand but it is a little high if you use all the recommended products. I probably need to over the choices in the brand.
This product works best for my skin because I have very oily skin so it's a great balance of just enough moisture.
"I've only been using this for a week, and noticed a difference in one of dark spots within four days. FOUR DAYS!"
It's really cool and this was the first thing I thought of to get this stuff off of my really terrible skin
"A good product took a little longer to see the results then my usual product, not that expensive? still work."
Is a good product but it would be better if it was a little bit cheaper and be able to be bought very much money in their pocket
Best stuff Eva. Smooth creamy goes on effortless love how it stays underneath my foundation without making me feel greasy.
Its nice my skin is wonderfuland the price is good I will continue to buy this product all the time I just love it n will continue too
It feels great on the skin and works greatly. This is my favorite lotion i think every one should buy this product.
Very good product to use buy it u will no regret smells good makes u look good an feel good as well real talk
I can use this product and my skin feels fresh and smooth. I feel as if it replenishes my skin . I would recommend this product to everyone.
"My girls in they're 20's noticed and said "" You look really good"" I was like Hum? then I remembered I had started using this product."
It was really good and amazing. It was definitely a good product and i would definitely recommend it.
This product is the best. If it works on my face it can work on yours. It's easy using this hope you enjoy it.
This product feels amazing as applying and makes skin feel smooth and moist. It's not oily just ver smooth. I just love it and the scent of it.
It's my 2nd bottle I love it so much feels great to my skin. It gives glow to my skin feel. I am disappointed with this product. Thank you Olay

Started using total effects about year ago. People ask me all the time what kind of moisturizer I use. It's really changed my skin for the better.
Look and feel younger by using Olay Total Effects Moisturizer. This Moisturizer leaves skin soft and smooth without making your face feel oily.
"Works really well, I get the one with suncreen, and it's small enough to be able to carry it on the plane."
I use this as a skin protector before I swim. It seems to minimize the dryness and damage daily chlorine exposure can cause.
Love this moisturizer. Goes on light and helps my makeup go on smooth. And has SPF 15 whic with my light complexion is great.
Feel the skin gourgeos and healthy this products have a good price .
