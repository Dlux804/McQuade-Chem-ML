washing/cleaning with wash cloth or other buff cleaner doesn't leave the same clean feeling. daughters and friends notice difference immediately. great product
Very nice. Gave me a nice exfoliation without drying out my skin.
I have bought the device in February and it has stopped working now. Not sure if it has a warranty period.... :(
I purchased the prox cleansing system to take on a vacation. The system was faulty. It would not turn off. I literally had to remove the batteries in order for it to turn off. I did not read the return policy. As I kept looking at the system that I could not use I decided to look at the box regarding the return policy and of course it is way past 60 days.just want others to read the return policy right away. I purchased an additional cleanser which I Love.Just use it with my hands.
"I have been using this Brush for about five months it wonderful product. My skin feels like silk and it deep cleans. I haven't had any breakouts since I started using this brush. I really can't say enough about it, it's great every one should have one. Even my husband likes using it."
This is the second time I have bought this product. The first one didn't last long either but I thought I might have just purchased a bad one. I bought it again. This product lasted 3 months. Installed new batteries. Still would not work. Don't waste your money on this. I sure won't ever again. On the value it wouldn't let me choose 1 star.
I loved this brush until it stopped working. I thought maybe it needed batteries because I had to hold the power button to keep it going. I went to change the batteries and there was water in the battery compartment. Since it is past the warranty I am stuck with a hunk of plastic that is useless. I am better off spending the money on a nicer brush.
Purchased the cleansing system about 3 months ago. The brush really gets down into my pores along with the exfoliating renewal cleanser leaves my face tight and fresh. The only exception is water gets into the brush corroding the batteries. The facial brush stopped shortly after 3 months. Wondering if others are experiencing the same issue.
This brush is great but it stopped working a little after a year. I saw a couple of posts that the brush stopped working after changing the batteries and after using it in the shower. The same thing happened to me too after both those scenarios! Did anyone get any type of response if regards to that?
"This brush helped me keep my acne under control. It was gentle on my senstive skin. I was in love until..... the brush spontaneously broke after 1 1/2 month's I'm guessing from water damage. I would not recomend useing it in the shower as it claims. Wish it still worked, its a great affordable option compared to the other products on the market."
"I loved using my face brush, it made my skin so smooth and feel really clean. I would use it in the shower to clean my face but after a while it stopped working. There was water damage inside of the brush. I was really upset by this because the box said it was water resistant and could be used in the shower."
Very nice. Gave me a nice exfoliation without drying out my skin.
"I really do love this brush, but it stopped working after a few months! I would have to press the button in really hard to get the brush to work, and then it would just stop. Now it won't work at all. I really do not think it is water resistant."
