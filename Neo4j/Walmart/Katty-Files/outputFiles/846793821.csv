I am 77 years old and I have used this product for several years. I get comments often that my skin looks like that of a much younger person.
Great skin cream. Iâve been using this product for a long time and plannig to continue. Great value and yoy dont need to drain your wallet for good quality.
Best cream
I have NEVER been able to use a moisturizing cream before. They all burn my skin. They is the first one that doesn't burn nor leave a greasy feel. I have been using for 4 months and I am extremely happy!
"Although this product is not entirely organic, I feel good about putting it on my skin. When my favorite Vitamin C serum stopped being made I switched to this and I've been pleased. I use this along with coconut oil and my skin is happy!"
"Sometimes, when I start a new moisturizer, it irritates my skin and takes some time to adjust to it. Some products, my skin never adjusts to. This product was awesome from day 1. My skin has been clear and soft!! Thanks!!"
I believe it is working. I am using a prescription acne peel as well so it's a little hard to tell which one is working. I can however say that my face is brighter and it's definitely not greasy.
Smells like fresh picked oranges!! love how it is oil free and contains natural ingredients!!! highly recommended!!
it does not work for me. My skin began to burn and it turned red
I bought this product thinking it was natural. It's not organic or natural and it feels TERRIBLE on my skin. Aubrey's Organics is a better product line. It is truly organic and better for my skin and my health.
I love this moisturizer. It doesn't cause breakouts and works really well.
Great quality product at a great price! Better than some of the higher-end moisturizers I have used!
Good product for the price. I would recommend it to those who likes face moisturizer with less oily feeling.
"Makes my skin feel so nice! Very nice fragrance, smooth texture. Great price!"
I had to return it because of the smell.
Not greasy at all. Great smell. Skin feels smoother and younger.
I really like this vitamin C cream for my face. I have used this for about a year now.
