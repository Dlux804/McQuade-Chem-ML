This moisturizer is absolutely amazing. I have very sensitive dry skin and have tried numerous things to try to help that. With just the very first use of Olay total effects my skin was beautifully transformed! It feels so good on the skin and does everything it promises and it also has just a nice light scent! I've never been happier! I'd highly recommend this product to anyone!
"This moisturizer is awesome. I used to just use regular lotion on my face, but now that I am in my early 40s I needed to take it up a notch. And this is it. Its super light and makes my skin feel super soft. Doesn't clog my pores, and my pores seem to clog easily. This is my new go to face lotion. I would highly recommend."
"I've been using this product for two months. Yes it's brightened my spots. Must try!!!!!Best product as far as skin concerns about age spots , ECT......."
"I was asked to try this product before it was on the market. I am in my 60's, and this whip has changed my skin. Less wrinkles, goes on light at a feather, absorbs super fast, and smells great. My skin looks so soft and supple, and I use this on my neck area every day too. For what this product does for me, the price is very reasonable. There is no way this whip can be topped with anything better - it will be my forever moisturizer! Thank you Olay!!"
I never write reviews because quite frankly I never love a product but this is definitely my new favorite. I bought this a month or two ago and used it every day and night. I had light acne scarring and a little discoloration and after purchasing my second bottle of it I woke up one day and saw it was barley there anymore. Not only that but this does not make me breakout.It is definitely a little pricey for drugstore but I love its results.
"I am 27, acne-prone skin. I used the total effects before, it didn't live up to the hype and was overpriced. I decided to try this, and I am glad I did! First off, the price, while steep, a little goes a long way. Been on same jar over a month. It improved the look of my skin. I've notice acne scars fading and the overall look of my skin seems to glow. Fourth, it keeps my skin hydrated without an afternoon oil landmine. Fifth, it is a light refreshing scent that is actually soothing. A must try."
"Upon opening Olay Whips you smell a lovely light fresh aroma! Then you dab lightly your index, middle & ring finger in it & the texture is smooth & delightful! When you place it on your face the scent is beautiful & relaxing but also exhilarating! My face felt smooth & looked 15 years younger! This made me feel better about myself as it gave my skin a more balanced even look! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was somewhat disappointed in this product. The Texture is soft and silky, glides on beautifully however I am not a fan of matte finish. I prefer a slightly dewy sheen. The list of ingredients were superb for a woman my age. I was surprised one of the ingredients included fragrance which I found very strong in scent as well as as a stinging sensation when applied to my skin. Fragrance is alchol based and a known irritant. I have used Total Effects in the past with great results."
It works fine but leaves a tacky feel to my face. I'll retake an Oil of Olay face analysis on their website and see if they notice changes. That will be a test for them
I love Olay Whip! It's light enough to be worn any time with just the right ingredients to moisturize your skin. Here's a pro tip: Don't neglect your neck.
Excellent!! It makes my face as soft and smooth than ever before! Thank you Olay
"I use different Olay products & some I stay with while others I replace to try others. Olay Effects Whip will definitely be a keeper. It's light, silky and applies easily. It has a fresh, light aroma. There was no sticky feel after applying but a softness not usually found with moisturizers. My skin felt soft and smooth, even after a few hours. I haven't used it long enough to see any visual effects yet. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried everything for my face and I have never come across a lotion like this. I have a couple of very dry patches on my face that I have never been able to tame. This is the first lotion that I can use morning and night and is the perfect combination of moisture. My dry patches have been rescued! Love it!! So relieved to finally find something that is perfect for me!
I got a sample of this and used for a week and noticed it does a very good job of moisturizing. I have purchased very high priced moisturizers in the past and this product (the Light As Air Finish) seems to be working just as well and I don't need to spend a fortune. Would recommend to my friends.
The first thing I noticed was the light pleasing scent of the moisturizer. I use it before putting on my makeup. My makeup up goes on smoothly. After using it for two weeks my skin does look a little better. Looking forward to seeing the improvements at the end of a month. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the feel of this moisturizer but I use the regenerist red jar and other than the light feel, I don't see much difference. Both do minimize wrinkles a bit. By the way, I thought I didn't receive it but in fact I did...found it was wrapped up as a Christmas gift!!! Lol. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using Total Effects Whip Face Moisturizer for about 4 weeks. I love the light feel of this cream. Not at all greasy, but provides much more hydration that I would have expected. It is an excellent, and smells great.d [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product leaves my face soft as I imagine clouds are. I love the feel of my face, no rough spots. I have only been using it a few days but I would definitely recommend. It is very light, no heaviness or greasy feeling like other products have left behind. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Oil of Olay products since I was 18. I didn't notice any change in my skin the few times I used it. I do like Oil of Olay products, but will only use what I think benefits my skin. I will be returning this in it's entirety and please cancel any other shipments as of 12/10/17. Thank you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product makes your face feel amazing. It is like body butter for your face. It makes your face soft, silky and smooth. It is very rich and I use it with and without my makeup. Keeps my face hydrated all day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Goes on smoothly, skin feels so silky. It absorbs really fast and no oily look. I love how it makes my skin look and feel. But I have dry, mature skin, I'm 63 years old , for myself will probably stick with the regenerist products they help more for my skin issues. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was amazed because I have very dry skin and this is a whip product. I am not surprised although because it is an Olay product which speaks volumes of effectiveness, quality and great pricing. I used it without my other Olay products to see how it would do stand-alone and it rocked! My skin was thouroughly moisturized and felt great all day. Definitely will buy again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay has out done it in the moisture world!!! Feels and smells like a body butter for your face. Light as air, doesn't feel all heavy on your face. I love the way my face feels and looks after a week of usage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Haven't used this product for very long so its difficult to say how well it works. I've tried almost every product on the market and nothing has helped diminish wrinkles or dark spots. The WHIP feels nice on my skin and is very rich. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love the feel of the product. I have used it every morning and every night for 7 days. It doesn't take much to cover the surface of my face. I love the way my skin is feeling and would recommend this product to anyone. I've have very sensitive skin and have had no issues with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product feels great going on the skin. It absorbs very quickly and my skin is left feeling soft. I have combination that can be quite oily in the T-zone, and this product moisturizes the drier areas of my face while not feeling to heavy on the oilier areas. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
If we start when we are young caring for our skin when we are older we will be happy to look younger than our years. This is a very nice cream-light scent which I appreciate. The cream goes on nicely and absorbs quickly. I will need to give it more time to be able to comment about how well it makes your skin look regarding dark spots and fine lines. I like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried OLAY TOTAL EFFECTS WHIP FACE MOISTURIZER. I enjoyed the light smell of this product. As with most Olay products, it did wonders for my skin, reducing wrinkles and making my face feel so soft. The whipped consistency of the lotion was light enough to wear under make-up without affecting it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm someone who doesn't like the feel of heavy, greasy moisturizers, and will use just a tiny bit, so I'm so glad that Olay now has a light feeling moisturizer. The product feels great on application, absorbs quickly, and leaves my skin feeling satiny smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way it feels, it's very light and silky as I apply it yet it performs like it would be a much heavier cream. It has a light scent, nothing irritating. I love the results, a smooth and even finish - I look and feel youthful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"It may look like a heavy cream, but once it goes on your skin you will realize this is something else completely. It becomes light and refreshing on your skin but still moisturizes. Amazing, must try! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was ready for a change due to my changing skin, and thought I would try Regenerist. Then you sent this to me! In one week, my skin is softer to touch. Red rough patches on the sides of my eyes are gone!! The fragrance is wonderful! It feels so light and soft when applying it to your face. I will definitely change to Olay Total effects Whip. Thank you for making it."

"Have only been using this product for a week so its difficult to tell if it really helps. I've tried almost every face product on the market and have not found any that help improve the texture, wrinkles or dark spots. This product was very soothing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product feels good because it is smooth and silky as you apply it and it has a great mild scent. It absorbed quickly and leaves a Matt finish. I have used Olay products for 20+ years and recently changed to Beauty Control after 6 months I have already switched back to Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
First I want to say thank you for the generous sample. I have only been using it for about a week but I love it. It goes on so smooth and doesn't make my face feel oily. I use it morning and night on my face and neck. I have used other Olay products but this one is by far the best. Love the smell and the jar is very pretty also. Thanks again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a great moisturizer! Not too greasy but very moisturizing! My skin is part oily, part dry but more dry in the winter so this product is perfect! No scent either which is just what I'm looking for! I look forward to seeing how my skin does using this product long term! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I wasn't sure about the fact it is so light, but after I tried it I LOVE it. My skin is soft, smooth, and looks much younger after only using it for a couple of weeks or less. I would highly recommend this to my friends who are all about my age. Great product!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"For a product that works like a cream it is amazing that it feels so light on your skin. I was pleased and surprised on how it felt on my skin, it is a great product and well worth trying, you will be pleased with the results and feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay whip is an excellent moisturizer day or night. It is completely non greasy, yet super hydrating. Even after just a week I have seen an improvement in my complexion and fine lines. Excellent product! Highly recommend!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have always used Olay products, but this Whip moisturizer feels like air on your skin. Unlike the creams and lotion (which is great) this feels different. I have not tried it long enough to comment on it effectiveness but if it works as it feels, then I would definitely recommend. By the way the scent is refreshingly heavenly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Was pleasantly surprised that the scent was so light. Most of the Vit. C products I have tried have a strong unpleasant smell. This cream is so light and soaks in well-no waiting for the stickiness to dry down. I liked it and am still waiting for total effect after the whole jar is used up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product truly satisfies the thirst of your skin. It absorbs rather quickly! I don't need a primer after using this moisturizer. I also like how it doesn't leave an oily feel or shine.
I love this moisturizer and highly recommended it. Your face will thirst no more. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really love everything about this product. I can't comment on the results as of yet as I have only been using this for about 4 days, but it feels wonderful on my face and I will buy this product and recommend it. I am not using my year of birth over the internet so that is not correct, I do not answer that question because of the internet sorry [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What a wonderful opportunity I had receiving and sampling this cream! I love the feeling of this cream, it is silky smooth going on. It absorbs nicely and does not leave any greasy feeling. I will be using this as my go to every day face cream from here forward and thank Olay for the sample! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Olay whips is light in feel and fragrance. I've been using the Olay 7 products for at least five years and this one does not disappoint! It's non greasy and smooth. What I like most is that my makeup goes on well over it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product smells great, goes on well and I have already seen a difference. Although I use Olay products,l really like this particular product. I am 63 and my skin looks in its 40's thanks to Olay! This particular product has the moisure I need and the balance for my skin. Thank you Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
OLAY Total Effects Whip feels so light when applying to your face. A little will do you. My face feels smooth and softer after a week of usage. I feel like my skin can actually breathe with this OLAY moisture. The only problem I have is the protective lid getting it off. Once off you will find a fine product inside. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I like the feel of the product. It is soft and absorbs quickly. I have not noticed any changes in my skin yet, but have only been using for a week. I think I would have probably benefited more from the Regenerist formula instead of the Total Effects. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love this product. It's very lite and fluffy. A little goes a long way. The smell is absolutely great. It makes my face feel smooth. It's not heavy feeling at all. I would definitely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is amazing. It is smooth to the touch. Keeps my face soft and smooth. It truly absorbs so fast. I can use my mineral makeup within a minute of applying this moisturizer. My face stays so soft. This product truly is a Drink for my face. I love, love, love this! I can't wait to try the Regenerist Whip. Thank you, Olay!"
I have always been a huge fan of the Total Effects product line. Everytime I venture to another moisturizer I always find my way back to Total Effects. I love the light weight feel and this will be great over a serum especially in the summer months or in humid climates. Although it has a lovely scent it doesn't linger so if you aren't a fan of the initial smell not to worry!
I've noticed a huge difference in my skin tone. I have very fair skin and my cheeks are usually blotchy red and after a couple weeks there was a noticeable even tone. This moisturizer is so light-weight and leaves my skin feeling soft and healthy.
Thank you for the sample of this product. I've been using it for several weeks and love the way my skin feels. Definitely makes my skin feel smooth and soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

It is so light on skin and remains all day long even if you are cooking there is no greasiness on the skin.
I loved how this felt on my skin. Will definitely buy again.
Very light and easy to apply. Doesn't get all over my pillow. Not much smell.
i like this very much. acts like an expensive face cream.
It burned my skin and irritated my daughters skin. It's not for sensitive skin.
