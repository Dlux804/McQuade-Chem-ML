"Can I just say , if you have oily skin, maybe you should go without lotion on your face (question mark face emoji ) , being that you have natural oils that will keep it moist?? Just saying.. but this product made me feel like my face ,that is always dry , was balanced . I have dull skin especially after using a face wash and this lotion brings my back to life! And all you need is a drop! It smells great too!"
"This product is so great, it helps my skin a lot. It makes my skin feel really great. It is awesome. I am so thankful for this product. Omg! I love the fragrance too."
"Last week when in Las Vegas for a conference I realized I'd left my moisturizer at home. I ran to CVS looking for the brand I normally use and was unable to find it. I saw this Shea Moisture product sitting on a shelf all alone. I said what the heck. Well, it was the best decision I've made in a long time!!"
"I was hesitant at first about putting 100% coconut oil on my face but I'm glad I got this. Living in the desert, I need something to keep my skin hydrated. This did the trick. The only issue I had was the pump not working almost half way through. I had to use the stem of the pump and other told to scrape out the product. Not very time efficient. Maybe switch this one to a jar also would help."
"I'm sue this is a good product, but not right for me. Made my skin feel dry. I'll use the rest on my arms or neck. I have very sensitive skin, so a lot of moisturizers make my face feel dry."
"I liked everything about this product until I tried it at home. My face became very red and burned. Disappointed to say the least, but I will still use other products from SM for hair and body."
"I have sensitive skin, breaks out easily with new products and somewhat dry skin. This lotion keeps my face moisturized and no break outs. The only qualm I have with Shea Moisture is most of their lotions are in horrible packaging. Once you have a quarter bottle left you need to cut it open to use the rest. Happens with the body lotions too. I would give 5 stars is the bottle wasn't such a pain."
"This is definitely my all time favorite facial lotion now, and probably the only lotion I will ever use on my face again! This product does exactly what it promotes; lightweight hydration without a greasy feel. I tend to get oily, especially if I use moisturizer on my face. Not with this one. I actually use this right before I apply my makeup. I even mix it in with my foundation most days!"
"A creamy, light lotion that does not inflame my skin! I have dry, flaky...oily! skin that hates every product I've tried. Though I have only been using it for a few days the 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Face Lotion is amazing! I just might be able to toss out the other stuff. Fingers crossed!"
"Love the lotion! Lightweight, non greasy and hydrating. Love that there are no chemicals and parabens. However, I cannot get the lotion out of the pump. It squirts a little but no where near enough. I always have to unscrew the top and squeeze it out. Also the smell is great but a little overpowering. Please work on the improving the pump and lowering the amount of fragrance, otherwise this is winner!!!"
I have sensitive skin so i was a little hesitant about trying something new for my face. My skin has been extremely dry and nothing was working so i decided to give this a try. After 2 days my skin soft well moisturized with out looking greasy. I will be using this from now on. Its great for my sensitive skin! Smells good too!
"I bought this lotion because my face skin was so dry and i was looking for something with natural ingredients so i decided to try this lotion, and i love the sweet coconut smell, and it feels so light and moisturizing, I'm totally buying this again! The only problem is when you pump it it barely comes out but out of that is fine."
This is my favourite face lotion I've ever used Im so happy I gave it a try. My skin instantly looks better after applying. I have very sensitive acne prone skin that can also be very dry which in turn makes my acne worse. Ive never used a lotion that is both so hydrating and lightweight. It even seens to minimize the appearance of my pores. It also wears well under the sunsceen I apply over it.
"I tried this lotion because I have used the coconut face wash, and loved it. I was very disappointed that after a few days of using this lotion (no other changes to skincare routine) my skin was dry and flaking on my cheeks and forehead. Exfoliated and after a couple days my skin was extremely dry again."
"I had high hopes for this product, but it was a big let down for my combination skin."
"The lotion smells amazing but is very thick. So thick that it doesn't go through the pump, it's light and moisturizes the skin very well but feels like it's just sitting on my face."
I love how this feels on my skin. I love the consistency of it as I rub it in. It is a wonderful product. I will keep using it.
"It seems to dry my face up even more, so I had to purchase ponds for my face for the much needed moisture"
"Lightweight moisturizer. Light coconut scent. Love the feel of this on my skin! Does not break my face out, like most moisturizers do!"
"I like the light smell and how it goes on, but it makes my skin feel very tight almost immediately, as if i didn't put moisturizer on at all. It's not exactly worth the money"
"I wasnât sure about this product, nearly $10 for a small bottle but a little goes a long way. The smell is plesant and I use it after my toner. It effectively moisturizes my face and leaves no flaky patches! Will update later."
Love this product!! Seems to rewind the clock. Smells great not greasy. Fabulous!!!
"is amazing, i feel my skin hydrated and fresh i bought the first time 1 years ago and now is my cream every day!"
"It smells good, and it feels great putting it on but it sits on top of my skin and I think made my face dryer than it was at first. My face had patches of dry skin and you could tell, it looked like I started peeling from sunburn or something"
"I usually turn to Nivea for my moisturizing needs, but decided to try this out and was pretty impressed. Definitely lighter in consistency from Nivea. I am not a fan of the smell however. It doesn't smell bad, but it takes some getting used to."
The lotion smells great and it's not greasy which is a plus for me cause I have very oily skin... I have been use it twice a day for about 3 days now and the pimples on my face have increased drastically and I mean DRASTICALLY!!!!!! Maybe my skin just doesn't like coconut oil but that's just my experience with this product.
"I've been using this product for two weeks. I tend to have sensitive breakout prone skin and I sweat a lot. So far so good, even around the eye area. This product seems thick, but goes on without feeling heavy and greasy... but your skin feels moisturized and protected. It actually works as a good base before makeup (though I don't wear a lot). I enjoy the smell, it's one of the reasons I like it! A light tap makes the product come out. Reasonable price for quality. I normally use bare minerals, but may switch to this instead."
"I have very pale, sensitive, acne prone skin that does not respond well to products. I use this after cleansing my face and it is amazing. It leaves my skin hydrated and so so soft without clogging my pores or making it oily. Will definitely stick with this product."
This is Fantastic Lotion! The smell of SheaMoisture 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Facial Lotion is Very Delicious smelling
"I was so excited to try this lotion, but i think it gave me an allergic reaction. Few minutes after applying it my skin was so red, my cheeks was so warm and my skin felt like it was burning :-("
"This lotion is very thick. When some is pumped from the bottle, a void is left. To get more out, GENTLY tap the bottle on a hard surface to move lotion into the void and pump again. Repeat as needed."
I just purchased this today and decided this will be my new face moisturizer!! I've been looking for one that smells wonderful and you can ACTUALLY smell it & also works great! It leaves a sticky feel after which I love and automatically my skin felt hydrated and it didn't leave any greasy feel at all. I love this product DONT CHANGE A THING !!! Some people actually like fragrance . If you don't like the fragrance purchase something else !
"If you have oily skin, this is a good moisturizer because it does not leave your skin greasy or shiny. This is the only face moisturizer that has ever made my skin look matte. The downside to this product is the warm sensation it gives my skin when I put it over my toner and the scent (I personally don't love it). I'm going to finish using the bottle I have and not repurchase it."
"I think this is the best moisturizer that I have ever used! I have been using it for 2 months now, and I swear it makes my pores nearly invisible! I LOVE the smell too! I have dry sensitive skin, and this works great for me! Please don't change a thing! I replaced my expensive origins moisturizer with this stuff and it works even better for me :)"
"effective lightweight lotion, mild delicious smell, I have sensitive skin and had no problems, more than u think is in there"
"The lotion left a white residue on my face, even after i rubbed it in. Broke me out and felt greasy"
