"I was having a few break outs and couldn't find a skin routine to help, I don't like to use acne meds, when I saw all the natural ingredients I wanted to give it a shot! I use this night and day and like other uses said, it does feel heavy at first on the skin, but give it a minute! Let it soak in! My skin is feeling great and the tone is evening out, even though this isn't a claim of the product. I love it! Please don't discontinue!!"
"I usually dislikemoisturizers because they feel like a heavy layer over my skin and it takes ages to absorb, but this absorbes almost instantly and leaves my skin feeling refreshed. Unlike traditional moisturizers which give a oily look to your face before it's absorbed, This one gives a really beautiful natural glow to your face. I worried about the strong smell at first but when it's on your face you can't even smell it."
This moisturizer is amazing! I use it as both a day and night mask. I also love that the ingredients are 97% vegan. This product makes my complexion very bright and I've received several compliments. I always refer them to this product because it's just that amazing.
"In general, I love Garnier products for both hair and skin. Since I suffer from rosacea, I'm always looking for skin care products. I maintain real aloe plants but it's messy and impractical. This product is pretty good after a week of twice daily use. My redness is diminished."
I'd like to point out that several other Garnier products have worked for my rosacea and then they stop making them. Please don't stop making products that calm and cool skin. Rosacea is hard to treat.
"I like the idea of no mineral oil but this cream does have a very runny consistency and after I apply it, it turns sticky. But it has a nice refreshing smell, much better than the one with rose water."
"I've been using this product for several weeks now. I like that it feels light, smells night and isn't greasy. However, after I apply and it soaks in, my skins ""rolls"" off in sheets when I run my finger across my face. Which in turn makes my make up extremely patchy, even a day after application. I don't think I'll continue using this product."
This product didn't add any moisture to my face all it did was leave a sticky feeling all day highly disappointed expected better I I would even use a small amount leaves your face feeling stiff even after i wash off
"I have sensitive combination skin. I bought this moisturizer a couple weeks ago because I thought the aloe would help my winter dryness. This product made my skin 10x worse, my face is now cracking and flaking off. I wish I read there was salicylic acid and other drying chemicals before I used it. It smells good though and feels nice when it's on!"
"my mom got this for me when i told her i needed a moisturizer after my face started peeling because it was so dry during the winter months. within a week of using this my face has been hydrated as ever and i'm very impressed with the results. my skin isn't too sensitive but it doesn't seem to contain any ingredients that don't agree with my skin type. also a plus, it doesn't make your face feel greasy and/or oily. love it!"
I just bought this yesterday and so far I love how it made my skin feel so soft and moisturized while using only a little bit of product. A little definitely goes a long way with this product due to it's consistency. The only thing I didn't like about it was the smell. I do love that its 97% naturally and a vegan product. I would definitely recommend it for dry skin.
"Bought this because I my skin was scaly from the winter air! Loved how nourishing it was, but if you rub it in to your skin, it takes out what's in your pores.... Love my pores being cleaned, but not sure it's supposed to do that."
This product really helped fix my winter dry skin. I loved how great my skin felt when I woke up in the morning after leaving a thick layer overnight.
I was looking for something for extra moisture for the winter. This is it! I picked this up and am enjoying the added hydration this is adding to my face both morning and evening. I like that I can apply it extra thick as a mask as well.
Omg this moisturizer has made my skin feel so smooth. Normally they leave my face oily or dry but I didn't have any oil on my skin or anything plus i don't need a lot on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was very happy to find a low cost mineral oil free face moisturiser, and I do love aloe but This does not seam to soak into my skin and feels greasy after application. feels lite and fresh on my hand but tacky on the skin. No results noted just an overly sticky oily feeling."
I use this at night and my face feels so moisturized. I love it .
I been using this for almost 2 weeks. I love it as a day and night moisturizer. I would giving this 5 stars but when for the first time trying to use it as a mask it burn little. And the mask instructions weren't clear. I have sensitive skin and that light irish skin. But overall it was amazing I love it and will still use it as a day and night moisturizer cream only.
"I did not feel this product lived up to its claims of being fast-absorbing and non greasy. Left me feeling like I needed to immediately wash my face. It was, however, gentle enough that I did not have a problem with skin irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Honestly, I was extremely surprised by this product. I have a lot of allergies and my skin is super sensitive so I was a little hesitant to try this, BUT I am so glad I got the chance to try this. My skin is feeling so great right now. It feels renewed, it's hydrated without being oily. I use this mostly as a mask and I've had no issues with break outs or oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been trying this moisturizer out for about a month now and it's anazing. I have sensitive skin so a lot of products turn my face red and it ends up feeling greasy. Not this. My face feels great, I'm not breaking out. It smells amazing! Not too much that the smells overwhelms. I definitely would recommend this to others! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is made with natural ingredients, and it felt light on my skin. I have oily skin and thankfully this moisturizer didn't make my face oiler than it already is. This is one of the best moisturizers I've ever used. It works as it claims and it leaves my skin velvety smooth!. It has a pleasant smell but I wish it had a different fragrance but overall is a very good moisturizer!. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Aloe Hydrating 3-in-1 Moisturizer Is amazing it feel really nice on your skin an my skin is really sensitive but this really works it didn't even break out my skin looking to buy this [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think this products works great for my oily skin it smooths it out and keeps away black heads and most of my pimples. This is a great product . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I bought this and have used it for a few weeks, I loved it and then my cheeks were covered with raised bumpy breakouts. I'm so embarrassed as I haven't had anything like this since I was a teenager. Back to the drawing board to find a good face cream"
"I love how smooth and silky my skin feels after using this moisturizer. It works well with my combination skin without making me shiny, and yet mositurizes the dry spots that tend to peel. Just ensure to rub it all in, otherwise it becomes the mask and will peel - I usually rub the leftover into my hands/cuticles! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the fact that this is a very hydrating moisturizer without feeling too heavy on. The smell is nice and natural without being too strong, and a little bit will go a long way. It is very gentle and doesn't irritate my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This moisturizer is a game changer for me. I used it every other morning and night. It left my skin feeling so soft and smooth. The consistency was creamy yet not oily like others I have tried. It didn't break me out and I loved that. I didn't enjoy the smell but it wasn't unbearable for me. I would definitely recommend trying the Garnier SkinActive Hydrating 3 in 1 moisturizer with Aloe to anyone with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
When you first open the jar of this moisturizer is smells so heavenly and it's very very light weight. I have combination skin so I don't need thing to oil or dry. The is the the perfect moisturizer it's non-oily and the aloe soothes my skin especially living in Texas we are prone to face drying out so often. It is so awesome I even used it on other places. Also when you apply a thick layer at night you wake up with your face feeling so smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think it's an awesome product. It's non greasy feeling makes your skin feel smooth and hydrated without the clogged pore feeling and it's very light cream compared to others I have used. It doesn't consume much time at all to use this product whether it's used morning and night or as a mask which I tried both. It doesn't have much of a scent except for the aloe smell. I definitely would recommend this product especially it being all natural with a fresh feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the way this smells! My skin is very sensitive and I haven't had any sensitivities to it. The aloe is very calming and I love that you can use it daily or as a mask. My favorite part is that it is mostly all natural products! It moisturizes well under my make up (better than another high end product), and didnt cause any break outs for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Garnier SkinActive Hydrating 3-in-1 Aloe Moisturizer is amazing! I love the smell and the cool feeling on your skin. My skin is so soft and smooth now. I enjoy using it as a hydrating mask and as a moisturizer in the morning before putting on makeup and at night before bed. I would recommend this to anyone who needs hydration but still wants it to be gentle. Also it smells great! Love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Garnier Skin Active Aloe Hydrating 3-in-1 Moisturizer is a welcome addition to my daily routine. The product is light, non-greasy and very hydrating to my face and neck. I have been using for the past couple of weeks and notice that my skin feels softer and more refreshed on a daily basis. I recommend this to other people who want a product that is works well and is nicely priced. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have very sensitive skin and a lot of products cause a breakout. I have been using this daily for 2 weeks now and have had any problems. PLUS, the dry skin I normally experience this time of year with the changing weather is much improved. My skin looks great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like how the Garnier SkinActivr Day/Night Mask makes my face feel. It is really moisturising and soothes my skin. It makes my face feel real smooth and look healthier after use. It's a great mask for combination skin like mine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I washed my face with just soap and water and then applied the Garnier SkinActive. It felt heavy and greasy. I changed it up after a couple days. I washed my face with my Garnier Black Head Remover and then applied the Garnier SkinActive and I immediately noticed a difference! My skin felt instantly smoother and it didn't feel heavy or greasy. It took some trial and error but I'm pleased with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It is great to find a moisturizer that goes on light and doesn't feel greasy. Garnier has made a great mask to use any time of the day, and the natural aloe makes it smell and feel amazing! I used this twice a day for several weeks, and my skin feels softer than ever. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
The first thing I loved about this cream was that it didn't feel extremely greasy on my face. I have sensitive skin and have lately had dry patches on my face. After using this cream for a bit I've noticed how smooth and silky my face felt. I would recommend this cream to family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This cream really hydrates the skin. I put it on one night and forgot to use it the next day but my skin still felt silky smooth and hydrated. One of the things I love about it is that its not greasy like many creams. I like that its almost all natural derived so you know your not putting a bunch of chemicals on your face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love this product! It has easily made its way into my daily routine. I have been using Garnier Aloe Hydrating 3-in-1 Moisturizer for the last couple weeks now and it has left me feeling refreshed every day. It leaves my skin feeling soft, and the smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After 10 day of using Garnier Aloe Hydrating 3-in-1 Moisturizer it does a beautiful job of moisturizing and soothing your skin. It goes on creamy not greasy makes my skin feel vibrant and smooth. I'm very excited over this moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I thought that this was a really good product, BUT i already have really oily skin and I didn't need something to make my skin more hydrated. Unlike other products, this one made my face feel clean and not more oily afterwards. If you have issues with dry skin i would recommend this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have only started using this a couple days ago but it makes my face feel smooth (not greasy.) I hope it will continue to do well with my face as I seem to break out easily. Luckily, that hasn't happened with this product as of yet (fingers crossed [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product works well for moisturizing skin. It's easy to apply and isn't too greasy making it a really solid product. The only thing I didn't like about was the smell. It kind of smells like a strange form of aloe but not completely so it was a little weird. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I'm loving this moisturizer! From the first smell it's not a strong sent like some products, it smells very mild . it's very light and not tacky while drying . From the first moment I put it on I could feel the difference,, my skin was softer then ever and I can tell when I don't use it . It works excellent on my patches of eczema I could tell the difference within days . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Since I have sensitive scream, I was a bit skeptical. The first day I tried the cream I felt it a bit too creamy, but after I started noticing the change in my skin I was sold. It took about four days to see a difference. My skin looked fresh and toned. Definitely a cream I would recommend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer is definitely not greasy feeling. I would say it felt more slippery. It seemed like it absorbed quickly after application. However, when I showered in the morning after applying it the night before, my face felt slippery again as soon as it was wet. So, I feel like it did not absorb, rather sat on the surface of my skin. After using this product morning and night for a week, my skin feels softer. I love that it is natural, and it did not irritate my skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Its not just a day/night face hydrating cream, it's also a moisturizing cleansing mask! It's great for when I'm in a rush in the morning or just don't feel like worrying about the hassle of taking off all of my makeup at night time. It works wonders in keeping my face healthy and I don't know how I have lasted so long without it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought this three days ago. Can't say anything about the product at this point other than it hydrates the skin. However the smell is too strong and made me feel very uncomfortable. I'm going to return it. I would switch moisture rescue gel from garnier.
"This Garnier moisturizer is perfect for me. I'm a working mom so I don't have too much time for a beauty regimen. This moisturizer is light, absorbs quickly, leaves my skin soft and its scent isn't overwhelming- all important things when you get kisses from a toddler. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Garnier's new moisturizer is great. It's 97% natural and has no harsh chemicals and no harsh smell. It looks like a lotion but goes on as a gel. For the past 12 days since there is no SPF in it i have only used it as a nighttime moisturizer, which it's perfect for. It makes my skin feel super soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the fact that it's mostly made of natural ingredients. I could feel the hydrating effect when I used the cream. There are several problems I faced though. First of all, I was not a big fan of the scent. Sometimes it smells like aloe vera or cucumber but not in a good way. Also, the cream started peeling off in a gross way when I put sunscreen sometime after having put on the cream. Lastly, the packaging was not very secure. Just a flimsy tape over it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"woman's face should feel. The Garnier SkinActive moisturizer leaves a silky feeling on my skin and is not heavy like others I've tried. After a few days of use, I feel as though my skin has a more even look to it as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've used this product for 1 week. After the first application I could feel the difference in my skin. My skin is softer and hydrated. I am very impressed with the fact that my face will not sweat after application. Very important for the Louisiana girl!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Garner Skin Active Hydrating 3-In-1 Moisturizer feels wonderful on my skin. I have been applying the product in the morning and at night before bed. This product has left my skin feeling soft, and smooth not to mention I love the smell of this product. The moisturizer leaves my skin without a greasy feeling and absorbs perfectly into my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I will definitely buy this again! This has aloe juice and love the natural ingredients in the cream! I have used it nightly and as a mask once since the weather is getting colder in Chicago! I have not had any breakouts and my skin feels softer. A little goes a long way. I also plan on taking it on vacation with me in case I get sunburn! Absolutely love the ingredients and would use this on my toddlers! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"In my complete honest opinion upon the aloe hydrating 3-in-1 moisturizer, I was not the biggest fan at first. I have very dry skin, especially when it comes to fall/winter. I didn't give up on it right away though, instead I kept trying it each night before I went to bed and my skin hasn't been as dry as it usually is! I loved how it was silky rather than oily on my skin too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Works well for my combination skin, it is not only and absorbs well, feels great under mate makeup. Kept my skin moisturized through the night and felt great in the morning. It doesn't have a strong odor. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Great product. I gave this product a try on a whim and so glad I did because its amazing. I have dry skin and this works great without making my skin oily. Definatly reccomend the next time your looking for a hydrating moisturizer. Would not reccomend if you have oily skin already. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Really like the Garnier line of products, but this product was not for me. The moisturizer seemed to set on top of my skin and never soak in. I have combination skin, leaning to oily. After a few days use blemishes were starting. Anyone with drier skin would have better results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've only been using using the cream for a week now but it really is amazing! My skin feels and looks great. The smell and texture are great and it doesn't leave my skin feeling greasy like alot of other products do. I'm using it in the morning under my makeup and in the evening as my night cream. I would definitely recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product was really usefull. the directions were kind of hard to understand, I wasn't sure how much product to use and if my face needed to be wet prior to application. it made my skin very soft without being greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This face moisturizer/mask could potentially be a life-saver. It's amazing over dry areas or for those with dry skin. It didn't make me break out, but it's a bit too heavy over my more oily areas. The light, natural scent is pleasant and not overpowering. Knowing its ingredients are 97% naturally derived is a huge plus. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I buy garier products already but, this one is my favorite. This product leaves your skin really soft. The product doesn't have a beautiful scent but it smells more natural which, is good. I can see the difference in my skin without using it and using it. I definitely recommend this product to eveyone. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product is wonderful! I have always had a problem in my T-zone area. With a 10 minute hydration mask, this plumps my skin right up. I wish that it was suggested to be applied around the eye area too. This is a product that I will definitely be purchasing in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"For people who have dry skin but do not want to apply moisturizers that makes their face look oily and dark, Garnier skin active is the best choice. Only small quantities are required to be applied and my skin stays hydrated almost all through the day. I have a sensitive nose and do not want strong smelling creams but also do not want an odorless one, this mild smelling moisturizer seemed like a pretty good middle ground for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like Garnier's Skin Active Moisturizer. It's not greasy or oily so no shiny face from using it.It absorbs quickly into my skin leaving my skin feeling really soft. Nice pleasant smell. I love that it is made from natural ingredients. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This stuff was awesome! It left my skin feeling so super soft. I used it before bed after washing my face and when I woke up in the morning my skin still felt super soft. It was very lightweight and breathable, I didn't feel like my skin was being weighed down. I would totally recommend this stuff! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using Garnier's 3-in-1 moisturizer for almost two weeks and I can't really feel a difference. It was never clear before to me what this product was intended to do. I think maybe it didn't work because I've never really had a problem with dry or flaky skin before. Though I don't doubt this may do the job for someone with such skin problems. It's worth a shot. I do love that it's natural! Also, it's very easy to use too much of this stuff... Just a few small dabs will do.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I Love the way this product makes my skin feel soft, It doesn't dry out my skin like other products. I'm not a real big fan of the smell. But the over all experience is good. I would recommend this product to my friends and family. I have had people compliment me on my skin since using the Garnier SkinActive. I love that it doesn't feel greasy on the skin, like other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This moisturizer works fantastic! My favorite thing to do is apply a thick layer and let it sit for 10 minutes, it leaves my fave unbelievably silly smooth. I have sensitive skin and it does work well when I apply a thin layer as a daily moisturizer. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for a new moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the way this moisturizer smells. It has a soft,fresh green scent that disappears as it absorbs into your face and neck. It is nice that is has 97% naturally derived ingredients, but it really works too. It really it great for day, night or as a mask. Great moisturizer that feels light on my combination skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think that this product is well worth the money. I used it a few times as a mask but mostly as my daily moisturizer. I can really tell a difference in the way my face feels. I have oily/dry skin and this product did great. It left my skin feeling moisturized but not greasy or oily whatsoever. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I just used it for the first time and so far I must say I am impressed it is smooth and milky going on and like it said it rubs in quickly my skin feels soft hydrated and silky after using it not greasy at all will definitely be adding this to my daily and weekly routine so far I love it and it was quick to apply and literally took just a tiny bit to get my whole face and the fact that the ingredients are all natural makes it even better just love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really wanted to like this product. It feels nice to apply and has a pleasant scent. It does moisturize my skin. The only negative is enough for me to not enjoy using this product. It leaves a film on my skin. If I touch my face to much or try to rub in the cream to much it rolls into goopy little balls. I wouldn't want to wear this cream in the morning for that reason. At night when you will wash it off before going out in the morning is a better time to use this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Awesome!!! This product is a keeper. Haven't had a moisturizer this good in a while. This product is a 3 in 1 day/night-mask made for sensitive skin and contains aloe juice which helps keep the skin hydrated. It doesn't have a strong scent which is also awesome because scent can be overpowering. I used this product for a week and I've noticed softness and hydration in my skin again!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This mask is amazing, when I first saw this mask I was a little skeptical, but when I tried it, my mind was blown ! It's super easy to put on, hydraites my face, and smells soooo good! I would definitely recommend this mask to any one with dry skin, because it really does work! The only thing I would want to know before I get this product? Is where can I buy it once I love it?!? [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Garnier SkinActive is 3-in-1 day/night/mask. It's made with aloe and without parabenes and silicones! And it's Vegan! I love that it's more natural and it does hydrate your skin! I don't particularly like the smell, but I bet others love it: it's fresh and it almost smells like a fresh cucumber. I have oily skin so use Garnier SkinActive as night moisturizer or as a mask. It's too hydrating, for me to use it during the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is ok. I have dry skin and I don't feel like it really kept me moisturized though the day. When I put it on at night it works great but in the morning when I use it I feel my skin is dry during the day.i recommend this for an overnight moisturizer and not a day moisturizer.

I have always struggled with acne and I have to be SO careful about what I use. But I jumped in any ways and I'm glad I did. My fave felt smooth and freash and it didn't feel heavy! I love this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"The product was great. I washed my face at night before bed. It left my face moisturized. I have dry skin and the acne cream I use dries it out a little more dry. But, Garnier Skin Active did just what it says, kept my skin moisturized and active. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have use your product for about a week and love the results. My face is alot softer. I was worried that it might make my acne worse but that was not the case at all. It was also great to use at night . It did not make my face oily at all. Which I loved. I will definitely use this product again. And I will recommend you anyone. Thanks [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I tried this product for a week and a half. I must say I am impressed! It was creamy and moist, but not oily. It does what it says. I have dry skin patches on my face and most products leave my skin oily. This is a product I would purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
It smells nice and feels nice when you put it on. I used it as a night cream after washing my face. My face was oily in the morning though. I think it would be a good moisturizer for someone with very dry skin. Mine is more combination/oily so I don't think it's a good product for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the Garnier SkinActive Hydrating moisturizer for a week now. I love it! It does not have a strong smell which I like. I use it in the mornings, it absorbs into your skin quickly and works really well under my make up. At night, after I take my make up off, I put it on before I go to bed. My face feels very soft! It works well under my eyes and makes them feel very hydrated. I love it! This is definitely a keeper for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is one of the best creams I've tried, it makes your skin feel soft and supple, I put it in at night before bed and in the morning when washing my face I can still feel the moisture in my skin! Will be great when winter weather kicks in and dry heat in the house drys out your skin, I believe this will keep your skin from getting that dried out look, even during the day. I would recommend this to anyone who suffers from a dry complexion!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product made my combination skin very soft and smooth but not greasy. It is wearable day and night and went well under make up. I would recommend for hydration and balancing of combination skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Wow! What an amazing product! I have been using this for a week now my skin feels so smooth and looks so much better!

"This is a wonderful moisturizer! I have really dry skin at my T-zone and a lot of other products just sit on my skin. This does not. It soaks into your skin and makes it so supple! It's so versatile too. I use it any time, day or night. I've honestly replaced my night creams with this. It doesn't clog my pores and it's feels so luxurious on my skin. I'm officially hooked!

"I am loving this product! It does not irritate my sensitive skin, and I love how soft my skin feels. I have used it as a moisturizer and as a mask. No burning, no itching...goes on cool, and I find it to be very relaxing! My only concern was that the directions weren't clear. I had to go to the Garnier website to clearly understand.

The Garnier 3-in-1 moisturizer is great! When I first opened it the scent didn't bowl me over. It wasn't unpleasant just nothing exciting. I couldn't wait to try it. I washed my face first then applied it. It smelled great once I actually put it on...and it isn't greasy or oily. It left my skin feeling amazing and looking better and more hydrated. After using it for a few days my skin feels soft and smooth. What a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Usually I can't use many products without my skin breaking out due to high sensitivity. I have been using this product for over one week and no break outs at all. My skin feels light and hydrated. There is a fresh glow in my skin. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have officially added this cream to my daily routine!

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product was a near instant addition to my skincare routine. I have a dry/oily complection depending on the weather. In the midst of changing seasons this moisturizer has been perfect! It leaves my skin soft without ever been greasy. I feel good knowing how natural it is when I put it on my face. Can't imagine going back without it!

"I tried Garnier SkinActive's hydrating day/night mask every morning for a week. This is a great daily routine that kept my face from drying out, wasn't messy to use, and smelled wonderful! I'll definitely continue using this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this moisturizer for a week and really enjoy it. I like that it has natural products in it like Aloe Juice. It is clear of Parabens and Silicones. also dyes and mineral oil which is good. The smell is nice and it isn't too fragrant or overpowering. I am sensitive to fragrances so this is good. I will def purchase another bottle of this in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like that this moisturizes without feeling greasy or thick. I also like that it is so natural without a lot of crazy chemicals. The scent is pleasant without being overpowering. I would definitely recommend this moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved that this product was light weight and didn't feel greasy at all!!! I'm not the best about using tons of product on my skin. I prefer more of an all in one deal. Garnier hit the mark with this product! It felt great on my skin, and didn't irritate my sensitive skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think the product is very moisturizing. A little product goes a long way. It feels like a rich cream, and you can feel it working for hours. It is all natural which Makes me very happy, especially since it is something that is going on the face. I am happy with this moisturizer. It will stay be kept on my nightstand, as a go to! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have the hardest time when it comes to face creams. Everything is either too heavy and clogs my pores or too light and I flake because I'm so dry. This is the perfect face moisturizer. It feels rich when applying, but absorbs quickly and doesn't clog my pores. I also love that it has 97% naturally derived ingredients. The only complaint I had was the smell, but I'm thinking maybe it's due to it being mostly natural ingredients. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Love this product as a moisturizing cream. Was a little dissatisfied when trying to use as a mask. When put on per directions it left my face feeling oily. But I have noticed a difference in my skin as using it to rehydrate. Really great to use after being I. The sun all day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My experience with Garnier skin Active Aloe Hydrating 3-1 Moisturizing cream was amazing. The quality was smooth and easy to apply. No harse smells or odors. I am definetly buying more of this cream and using it weekly. It left my skin feeling softer and fresh. I loved it! I highly recommend this to everyone, young and old. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am not the best at sticking to elaborate skincare routines, so having a 3-in-1 moisturizer is perfect for me. For once I was able to stick to a moisturizing routine and after just a week my skin looks and feels softer and healthier. I love that the ingredients are natural and the light aloe scent is very refreshing. I have very sensitive, dry skin and GARNIER Skin Active Hydrating 3-in-1 moisturizer works great for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is amazing! I suffer from eczema and have not had an allergic reaction which rarely happens with other products. This has a lot of natural ingredients and smells so refreshing. My skin feels so smooth and silky but not greasy which is a plus! My only suggestion would be the packaging be improved to perhaps a pump for better use of the product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have combination skin, so this moisturizer was perfect for that. It was hydrating, but not too oily and perfect for my sensitive skin because I have some redness on my face as well. I would not recommend this product for people with just oily skin because it might be too greasy, but for someone with dry/sensitive skin, it would be perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I will be the first to admit that I have NEVER had a successful facial routine, regardless of the tons of products I have underneath my sink. This SkinActive moisturizer, you don't need a routine!! My face feels amazing and I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Garnier Skin Active is great. Smells divine, and it is a think hydration of refreshing moisture. The best think about Garnier Skin Active is that it did not leave my skin feeling greesy or oily at all. I felt fresh and had a nice glow after using the Garnier SkinActive 3-1 hydrating moisture day/night mask, th at doubles as a great any time moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am blown away by this product honestly. When I put it in my face it gives me a flawless dewy glow that revives the dullness of my skin. I've been using it for a few days and I haven't broke out either which is wonderful. I believe that's due to the natural ingredients within it. I even used it after waxing and the aloe is quite soothing for the irritation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I really like this product as a mask. Easy to apply and you are left with very soft skin. I have normal to dry skin and it was perfect for me. My teenage daughter has oily skin and it was a little too much oil for her skin. Smells clean and fresh too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked this product. I have oily skin except around my nose (yes I'm weird). I use lightly all over my face and thicker around my nose and it works perfectly. My face feels refreshed, not too oily and perfect for my dry spots. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have combination skin. I usually have to choose between dry skin or acne. With this I didn't have to choose. I've been using it for two weeks and my skin is soft and no new acne. I can't express how great my skin feels. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I loved this moisturizer! It is very lightweight and has a light pleasant fragrance. A little of it went a long way so the size of the container is great. My forehead tends to get pretty dry and after using the moisturizer each day my forehead has been fine. I would definitely recommend to a friend. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I think the Garnier Skin Active 3-in-1 Moisturizer does its job. My skin felt smooth and fresh after I used it. It doesn't have a smell which I like in any face product. I think it would be good for lightly sunburnt skin as well because it's aloe infused. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product worked great fo a basic face moisturizer. The scent wasn't overbearing, it went on smoothly and I liked the natural ingredients. Having more sensitive skin, it wasn't super oily and didn't lead to any breakouts, which was nice. It wasn't mind blowing, however, and wouldn't toss all my other moisturizers in place of it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This face mask doesn't have an over barring scent. The aloe is a very present aroma. It is most definitely a mask product. It is really thick so a little bit goes a long way. The product lays on top of the skin and slowly gets absorbed because it is so thick, hence, a mask. I would recommend using this product at night as opposed to during the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the Garnier Skin Active 3 in 1. My skin is so sensitive to everything it seems, I've tried many facial treatments but never found one I could use until now! Skin Active is so silky not greasy or thick feeling, doesn't dry up leaving that heavy feeling, no burning or anything, my skin looks feels so soft and smooth. I absolutely love it! I finally found my new facial cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got a free sample of Garnier Aloe Hydrating 3-in-1 Moisturizer. I love the fact that it isn't oily at all. The fragrance smells good. It's not thick on the skin, it feels very light on the skin. Am in love with the cream, I feel my skin so soft and you can actually see my face is soft. I feel like my skin is baby soft skin that my face glows. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I think this product is amazing. It does exactly what the description said. My first impression was it smelled good but will it leave me oily? Never the less this product is a gold mine and my newest favorite product. Its great for both day and night and i would recommend this to my friends [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's one of the best facial cleansers I've used. Its a refresher in the morning time. Your face stays free of oil and dryness all day. At night its also good at removing oil and make-up residue, keeps your face smooth and oil free. I would recommend use of this product to any one of my friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I totally loved this product. Just a little goes a long way. My face didnt feel oily at all it was fast absorbing. My face feels so smooth and fresh. I really recommend this product for any skin type. My husband has dry skin & i have oily and it worked so well on both of us. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think the Aloe Hydrating 3-in-1 is amazing for dry skin. It hydrates your skin so beautifully and makes it so soft that you just want to keep rubbing your face. Lol, the only thing I did not like about this product is the way it smells, I would like something that I am putting on my face, I want it to smell good not like medicine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product really helped my dry skin feel smooth and silky. I have tried multiple products on my dry/oily skin and haven't found anything to even compare to the Garnier Aloe Hydrating 3 in 1 Moisterizer. I would recommend this product to everyone with dry and/or combination skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Very great product! I have to be very cautious with what I use because I break out frequently , I either struggle with my skin being to dry and irritated or too oily . So with this I was nervous with it being hydrating it would leave me very oily like other products, but this smells great, isn't oily and leaves my face feeling amazing I honestly haven't wore makeup in a week because my skin has felt that great ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. I like that this product hydrates my skin. I have very dry skin and this product leaves my skin very moisturize. I use the product and it felt refreshing. Also, it did not left me skin itchy nor irritating . It completed most of its description except that is not fast absorbent it takes just a few second to dry but otherwise it leaves my skin smooth and hydrated all day. It does not have any strong smell but it does smells like aloe Vera very good smell in my opinion [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I liked the Garnier Skinactive, it made my skin feel soft instantly after its absorbed into my skin. I love that it contains aloe vera as it's used for many skin benefits, and the fact that its mostly from natural ingredients. The thing I didnt like was that I got confused with the instructions, it says ""apply to clean face"". I didnt know if it meant apply to a clean face or apply to clean your face. Overall it does hydrate your skin and you can really feel your skin soft. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all, I love how it's not oily at all! That is super important for people with oily skin like me. And although the consistency is on the thicker side, it's actually rather lightweight on the skin. It's great that it's a vegan formula, especially. Now, the only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because of the fragrance. Fragrance can be irritating on the skin, so I'd love it way more if it were fragrance-free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I absolutely love this facial lotion. I have very sensitive skin and this lotion has not irritated my skin in any way. The scent is very pleasant. It hydrates my skin, leaves it smooth, and does not leave it sticky. It also has a thick consistency, but does not leave a heavy feeling on your face. Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use moisturizer every single day, so I loved this product. It definitely does what it claims. The only thing I did not love was the smell. If I look past the smell, it is one of my favorite products! If you do put this on, make sure to wipe off the excess or there will be residue on your face and that just looks greasy. Also, I love that it is made with aloe! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product (Garnier skinactive hydrating 3-in-1 day/night mask ) is a breath of fresh air. This moisturizer has a fresh scent, it feels light when applied and it isn't oily. You can use it day/night and you can also use it as a mask which is amazing! Thank you Garnier for such an amazing product even my husband enjoyed it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Upon trying this mask I was impressed! I am not one to normally use a facial mask or moisturizer, but this, however, was worth the try. Thick and creamy, nice smell, left my skin feeling smoother after one use. Made with a vegan formula, and no silicones or dyes which makes me like it even more. I will definitely buy this from now on. I recommend you try this as well, it is worth it. You will not be disappointed! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"WOW! I'm amazed at this mask. My face is very dry and nothing helps. Now with this mask, my face is moisturized and flawless! The tingly sensation it gave my face felt like it was really doing its job. My boyfriend even said my face smelt so good after using it. There is so much inside of the jar too. It's just an awesome product all around. Thank you Garnier! I will definitely buy this from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely LOVE this day/night- mask. I have never used a product that helps hydrate my skin so well. I hated putting on anything because I was so afraid it was going to make my skin even dryer. I don't have to worry about that at all with this product. It has a light scent and the scent is very enjoyable at that. It is not a thick sticky mask either which I really like. I really can not say enough about this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I think this product is awesome! I suffer from oily skin and from time to time very dry skin. At first, I was hesitant in using Garnier Skinactive for my face. I'm glad to say it's incredible, my face felt fresh non-greasy which is a huge win for me. It moisturizes without leaving your skin oily. I also enjoy the scent. I will definitely continue to use this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am not a regular moisturizer or mask user before using this product. However, now that I've tried this it's definitely something I will continue to use in the future. It leaves your skin feeling smooth. I have natural oily skin, so I love that it's a non-greasy formula that doesn't leave my skin shinny! Plus, anything with Aloe is a bonus to me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think Garnier Skin Active 3 in 1 is absolutely amazing. I have dry skin and this product kept my skin hydated all day. I Also tend to have dry hands, and Gariner Skin Active 3 in 1 keeps my hands soft and silky smooth all day, just from applying the products to my face. I especially like that this is a 3 in 1. It saves me time and money by not having to purchase separate moistures for morning/night or a face mask. This also smells amazing and is a vegan product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I honestly didn't have high hopes for this product as I haven't found many Garnier products that work well with my hair/face. However, I was pleasantly surprised with this face lotion! It's probably the most light but HIGHLY moisturizing thing I've ever used. I have big problems with flaky/dry skin on my face and after only a few days of using this product (two times a day), I've noticed a huge difference in my skin. What a surprise! I also really enjoy the smell of this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really enjoyed using this product and could feel how smooth my skin was with even just one use. I love that it can also be used as a mask since I do have dry skin. It has a soft aloe scent to it and I like that you can't smell anything once it is rubbed in. I would recommend this product and think is a very generous size that last for a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At first I was a little hesitant about trying out this product, since any product I tried didn't work. But when I first tried this product. It left my skin feeling soft and it was something that I haven't felt in such a long time. This is definitely worth 5 stars. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I would recommend this to others who have drier skin than usual. This product worked very well for me in my experience. It felt very smooth and was very easy to apply to my face. Before using this product, you should know that it would come outt better if it came out of a pump instead of a jar. Overall, this product is very useful in helping my face feel more hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I tend to have a very dry and sensitive skin, for that I can't use just any face mask. But with this Garnier Skin Active mask, I was able to get a very smooth and fresh face everytime I use it, without having to worry about my sensitive skin. I am in love with this mask it not only hydrates my skin, but it can also be use in day time and at night time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Honestly, I have been looking for a good moisturizer that I can used everyday and every-night, and this product did just that! It leaves my face feeling refreshed and absorbs into your skin within minutes of applying! This product is super light weight and is also vegan friendly! The ingredients are almost completely natural, so you don't have harsh chemicals being absorbed into your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First off, I absolutely love they way this moisturizer smells!! I used it last night and this morning and my face feels great! It's soft and feels smooth and I love that it's non-greasy! And seems to absorb quickly!! I'm looking forward to trying it as a mask! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this as a mask for about 15 minutes all over my face. When I rinsed it off, my skin felt super soft. All the wrinkles around and under my eyes looked much better. The dark circles were almost gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"When I first saw this moisturizer, I thought it was just like all the others...BUT I WAS WRONG! My Face was left feeling smooth and youthful again. It makes my face feel and look fresh. I'm definitely going to keep using it every night and as a mask on home spa days with my girls. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really like this product and love that its vegan. It has a pleasant scent moisturizes my skin perfectly. Its great that I can use it day and night, and though I was hesitant about the tingling sensation that lasts a few minutes after application its doing wonders for my skin.

This product is amazing. I love the ingredients. I'm always looking for something different and more natural. This was perfect. I love how my face feels after. So smooth and feels amazing. I even had my husband feel lol. Definitely worth trying! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've been stressing out lately which has caused my skin to suffer. After spending a day relaxing and using the mostiurizer made my skin feel smooth and refreshed! Wasn't sure if it would work with my skin because it's sensitive at times, but this product worked great! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like it but I don't love it. It smells nice. It's not terribly greasy, although I definitely know it's on my skin. It's too much to put on in the morning, and then add foundation and makeup, but at night it feels nice and cool on my face. I'll use it but I'm not sure I'd pay as much for it as the price asks. There are more natural options out there that cost much less. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The 3-in-1 moisturizer by garnier is awesome. A little goes a long way and it works wonderfully. I love that it can be used as a mask or as an everyday moisturizer. I use it before bed, under my makeup, and anytime I feel my face is dry. I highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have really dry skin and this product makes my face feel so silky smooth. The smell is really good. It doesn't irritate my skin either. I love the fact you can use it as an every day morsturizer or a mask. I use it every day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have always had dry skin patches, and was very excited to hear about this product. Unfortunately, the scent is much too strong for me. The product itself was comparable to other department store moisturizers I've used, but was nothing special. I will be sticking with my unscented specialty lotion for my face. I did try it on my feet and it left them soft and smooth, so I will continue to use it on them. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Ive been looking for a new skin care product and I definitely found it! It's great to put on after I wash my makeup off. It has an amazing smell and it's so gently yet hydrating, and it doesn't leave me oily (even though I'm really oily). Another pro is that it's not too greasy or too heavy, it's really a 3 in 1. Great for putting it on during the day without makeup, putting it on after makeup and as a mask! A great buy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really really enjoy this SkinActive moisturizer. It's so light and refreshing and gentle on my skin. I have very sensitive skin and this is perfect. It absorbs quick and you don't even remember that you put it on! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I thought that this lotion was great for a quick moisturizer. However, after wearing it for a while my face seemed to go back to being dry. It didn't provide moisture for a very long time. It is a product where you will have to continuously reapply. I really wish it would last longer and not leave me feeling the need to keep reapplying.

"I have had issues with dry flaky skin on my face for sometime now. It was always embarrassing to try and hide it. Since using Garnier Skin Active Hydrating 3-in-1 I notice a huge difference! My dry spots are gone, and my skin feels great! Other people have noticed as well, commenting how healthy my skin looks. I will definitely recommend this product to friends and family! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I tried the mask first and man did I love it! Have you ever wanted your face to feel baby soft again? I can't believe it did in one use. Plus the aloe gives you that cool refreshing feeling! If you like a product for multiple purposes this is so one you should check out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I highly recommend the Garnier SkinActive Moisturizer. I've been searching for a product that cures my dry, sensitive skin, and this is definitely the one. After using it for the past four days, my face already feels more hydrated and smooth. The moisturizer is rich and creamy, but not greasy or oily. It feels amazing and shows results quickly. If you have sensitive skin, this moisturizer is perfect for you! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product! This is the first time I ever used a product like this, so I don't have anything to compare it to, but I love it nonetheless. I love that it does not feel greasy or oily at all. It seems to make my skin softer pretty much immediately. It's also very soothing. The first day I used it I had a sunburn and it was instantly cooling and soothing. I also have rosecea and it seems to help with that some too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Smells great! It's not thick or greasy like most creams I've tried. Very hydrating even after washing my face. It didn't clog my pores! It doesn't make my skin feel oily afterwards! I would buy again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This product is absolutely amazing. I have trouble with dry skin and this has given me moisture back in my face. You don't have to use a lot...a little goes a long way.

"For the time that I have been using it, I feel like my skin looks much better. My face isn't nearly as greasy as it use to be. And when I use it as a mask, it feels very light. A lot of the masks ive tried previously are just too heavy. So I very much appreciated how light it felt. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for a few days now and I must say that my skin loves it! I have oily skin that instantly dehydrates after washing. This makes finding the right moisturizer quite difficult. Garnier has done it! My skin is instantly moisturized without feeling greasy! It absorbs quickly and feels incredible. Even though this is a face cream, I have been rubbing the extra from my hands onto my elbows and they too feel wonderful! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have combination skin so I was skeptical at first. But the Garnier Moisturizer 3-in-1 is the best. It hydrates my skin and leaves it feeling fresh without all the dryness.

Love that this can be used 3 ways, day, night, and even a mask. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I think the garnier skin active moisturizer is amazing. It has a very clean smell. It reminds me of soap smell. The texture was very smooth. The fact that its vegan and 97% naturally derived makes me want to purchase the product. My skin is now so soft. I also like the fact it has aloe juice in it.

"This Garnier Moisturizer 3-1 is Amazing! It smells so nice and fresh. The fact that it's made from 97% naturally derived products makes me trust t even more. And it has Aloe Juice!! Usually straight Aloe kind of irritated my skin a little bit, so I was scared that this would too . But it did not! It made my skin feel refreshed the first time I used it. It leaves my face super soft and glowing! I love the fact that it's a 3 in 1 and I could use it Day and Night and as a mask. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I didn't think a non-greasy moisturizer existed until I tried this faint smelling cream. I used it in my arms & legs and it didn't make me feel like a slip-n-side (like most moisturizing products do.) It did dry really quickly like the packaging says and it's gentle for those with sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I have combination skin.... both oily/dry. I struggle to find a moisturizer that moisturizes without leaving my skin feeling oily! This product is it! It can be applied both morning and night and can also be used as a mask, so it is a 3 for 1 product! The smell is also amazing! I have already recommended this product to a couple of people who have already started complaining about dry skin with the seasons changing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Before I used this product I wish I had known how good it smelled. First off It wasn't too oily and it did what it was advertised to do. I would recommend this product to everyone both I and my husband used and I noticed such a huge difference in both of our skin hydration [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Winter is near, and while this might not affect some, many people have to struggle with skin problems with the change of the season and this product will help with prevent most of these annoying problems from occurring. Skin care is extremely important and is so easy with this product. It also has the scent of some nicer sunscreens... mixed with aloe, of course. This has left my skin feeling moisturized and rejuvenated within the first usage. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I truly enjoyed this mask. As we get closer to Winter and chronic dry skin it is a matter liked this that will help to keep my skin hydrated and looking it's best as the cold pours in.

When i first opened the jar it had a fresh smell (like hanging out by grandma's clothes line with clean clothes). After applying such a fragrance all over my face and neck it was like my skin took a drink of refreshing ice water. I am a true fan and no i will not share my jar.

I only had it 2 days and i already love it. Several hours later you can still feel how soft my face is. The smell is also just right and not over whelming. I am recommending this to all my family and friends. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Oh my goodness, this smells so good. I am in love with the way it makes my skin feel! It is so easy to use and since it is a 3 in 1 I get to save money. I can use it in the morning before applying my make up or at night at my nightly face cream and I can even use it as a mask and get to smell good at the same time!!!

"I really like Garnier SkinActive because it has so many uses as a day cream, night cream, and as a mask. It contains salicylic acid that helps to clear up my skin while also hydrating it! I am a little disappointed that it is advertised as a natural product but there are quite a few ingredients that aren't natural. Overall, though, I like this product and think it works well.

"I am in love with this moisturizer! I love that this product is completely vegan and almost 100% natural ingredients. You only need to use a tiny bit and your whole face will be completelty moisturized which means this product will last you forever. It smells like aloe and is very cooling on the face. The best part is, you can use this as a day/night moisturizer and a hydrating mask! I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this is an amazing product. I was initially skeptical due to having sensitive skin. To my surprise Garnier Skin Active hydrates, moisturizers sensitive skin. I was impressed that Garnier Skin Active contained aloe juice which was something my great grandmother used daily, this was comforting. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Feels so good on my skin. It makes it super soft and supple like a baby's skin. It isn't greasy and instantly dries after you apply it leaving a matt finish. I couldn't find any hyaluronic acid since it says hydrating on the container. It only has salicylic acid to prevent acne or breakout. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is the best moisturizer hands down! It is made of natural based products which is AMAZING. It made my skin feel very soft and was not greasy or heavy feeling. I have very sensitive skin and this did not irritate it or cause any unwanted break outs. It has a very nice clean scent to it. One of the best things about it is you can use it in the morning , at night, or even as a mask. If you are looking for a moisturizer you can feel good about this is the one.

Well I have very dry skin and moisturizer is really the only thing that seems to help my skin when it comes to it being dry so I really recommend this moisturizer the only thing is the scent is little bit too strong but other than that it's a great product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have very sensitive skin so always nervous to try new things but I seem to trust products if aloe is involved. This hydrated my face but did not make it oily. The plus side is no unwanted breakouts . [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Its a good one. My skin was really dry and I tried this product and my dryness was gone in two days.But the odour is little too strong.Thats what i felt. I usually like odourless and Uncented skin creams and moiturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"So far so good, I've only used for a couple weeks but I like the way it feels and smells. It's easy to put on and not a lot of product needs to be used."
