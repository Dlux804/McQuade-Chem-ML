"I am so glad I decided to try this Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Night Cream. It is non-greasy and so light on my face. I love the way my face feels after using it, soft, nourished and healthier. You don't have to use a lot to get these results, a little goes a long way. It is well-worth the price! I wish I had known about this product sooner!"
Love this product. I use it every night and the Healthy Skin Anti Wrinklr cream with retinal during the day. I'm almost 68 and my age is always guessed at least 15 years younger! Haven't used foundation for years. Best thing out there as far as I'm concerned!
I purchased this product from the reviews I read. I'm a 51 year old woman and look younger than I am. I use ROC products religiously but came across this product which costs a little less. I have to say that I am very impressed with the quality. It goes on smooth and seems to help my fine lines. Would purchase again.
"My dermatologist recommended Neutrogena to me over 16 years ago. It was great then and still does a fantastic job. I've got the Day cream and the Night cream. Both are good no matter what time of day or which one you use. I found it does even out my skin color and tone- pushed 60 and don't look it. For the money, Neutrogena is the best bargain for your skin. I've used Olay Regenerist and can say that for the money, it's not worth it. It does not do half of what Neutrogena does."
Started using this several years ago when my wrinkles started to be very noticeable. They nearly disappeared after a few weeks and have never come back.
"I have been using this for about two weeks and I like it. I am 64 years old with wrinkles but I have noticed the crows feet around my eyes seem less noticeable. They are there but not as pronounced. The cream is non-greasy and leaves my skin feeling so smooth, once its absorbed. I will for sure buy another tube when it is empty. A final note...you don't need much to use so I believe this tube will last for quite a while."
"My favorite moisturizer-both day & night! No allergic reaction, no excess ""oily"" finish, well-absorbed & great results-my skin feels smoother & younger!"
"I've been using this product about one week, and I can see a big difference already. My face is not as dry as it was. I also like the fact that this product is fragrance free."
"This is a very light, non-greasy cream that is wonderful. I have been using it for many years now. I have tried other creams but have not found anything better."
My dermatologist recomanded me .........wow i found a great change in my skin after 3 month of daily using .......Just love it !
"I use this cream for a few years. Keeps my skin soft and moist. Very good product, considering the price."
"I am in my 2nd week of usage, and nothing striking has happen. The only difference in this and Ponds is Neutrogena cost . The serem to work a little bit better,"
"Neutrogena has been around for a long time. I was recommended their products as a young teenager over 40 years ago. This cream helps to lighten dark spots on my face and the retinol helps to tighten and smooth wrinkles. It is not a substitute for fillers and it will not make all your wrinkles around your lips disappear but it will make a noticeable difference. Use it every night. Even though it is pricey, you only use a very small amount each night so the product should last almost a month."
I saw a difference in the texture of my skin the next day! My pores also seemed smaller.
I think my skin looked younger after just a week. I am going to keep using this.
The old formula worked very well. I was in love with it. It would leave my skin so soft and smooth. I don't notice a difference now that the moisturizer has changed. I returned it.
"This cream seems to be working very nicely; feels great applying it at bedtime and my skin does look better than it did previously. Also, great price!"
"My face looks like I had a chemical peel go horribly awry! I took my granddaughter to school, and when the light hit my face she said 'Nana, you look very sick!' Thanks for a nightmare in a tube. I used the light mask regularly, that caused no problems so you removed it from the market."
Love this gentle retinol night cream. I have been using it for years!
It can be hard to tell how well these products work. I have been using it for 6 months and my skin has improved.
"I've only been using this product about 3 days, but my skin is noticeably softer. Hopefully, some of the fine lines will diminish with use. This is a keeper!"
Neutrogena took a great product and gutted it. They now put such a minute amount of retinol in the product that it is behind behind the stabilizers and preservatives; it is dead last. I'm returning the tube that I just bought.
"I am a college student with acne prone skin and a lot of post-acne marks....this moisturizer did not break me out and provided nice moisture (both day and night)....wore well under makeup and seemed to fade a lot of marks and smooth my skin tone, especially on my cheeks. Would recommend - love how my skin is getting a boost of vitamins as well!"
"I've been using and loving this product for nearly 10 years, and I was devastated to see that Neutrogena changed their fantastic formula to reduce its most powerful ingredients - above all the retinol, which went from being one of the leading ingredients to dead last on the list. The green tea extract also dropped significantly on the ingredient list. I sincerely hope that Neutrogena will consider returning the retinol to a more potent proportion of the ingredients. I would keep using this for the next 10 years and beyond."
"I used to use this - but noticed recently the formula had changed. Retinol is now listed last, and green tea as well is now far down the list. The effectiveness is greatly diminished. Why is this even called a retinol product now - when there is hardly any in it? Wish I hadn't bought it again recently."
"My skin is extremely problematic, both acne prone and sensitive. I'm 27, so I'm thinking about anti-aging and with skin issues it's difficult to find something effective that's also gentle. Since this get's a ""best"" rating on paula's choice, I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did. The formula is perfect as is, please don't ever change it and PLEASE, PLEASE don't discontinue it! Companies too often mess with a good thing and send loyal customers back to square one."
"I've been using this for years until I recently discovered you changed the formula and retinol is now the last ingredient. Very unethical to NOT let consumers know. Switching to Paula's Choice where they are ""up front"" about their ingredients at all times. Too bad, because I used to think Neutrogena was a very respectable brand."
I've been purchasing this for years because you kept a decent amount of retinol in this product and now I see that retinol has become the last ingredient on the list of ingredients when it used to be in the middle. I'm sorely disappointed and will stop buying this product. How sad
I bought and put on my face at night as directed and woke up this morning with what looks and feels like a chemical burn all over my face and neck. The skin under my eyes was swollen. It is painful to the touch still to this moment. My face looks and feels horrible. I dont even know what to use to soothe the pain. Please help. I wish I could post pictures of my face to show the gravity of this situation.
"I have received many compliments since switching to this lotion--I use it in combination with the day time cream with SPF. I've noticed that my complexion is much more even and smooth, and fine lines have disappeared (although the effects seem to wear off over time). My usual beauty routine of applying foundation to my face has changed...I now no longer need it and just apply a bit of powder for oil control and go! This is a great product, and I have already insisted that my sisters also buy it."
I tried various products. Many very high priced. My face just showed more lines and I looked all of my 83 years. I was feeling sad about my face. Thank goodness I remembered using a Nuetragena Natutal Moistureizer. It's back on my face. I'm happy again.
Im 27 and already have wrinkles! I also have acne that ive Been battling for years... i have used this product for 3 days now along with the day anti wrinke cream and blemish/ wrinke face wash... my skin hasn't felt this goodin years!!! Its so soft and smooth! My skin tine has evened out my blemishes have almost totally disappeared and the wrinkles around my eyes and laugh lines look better! I cant wait to see how much better it gets! Im so glad i found this product before i decided to have the CO2 laser done!
"This night cream is perfect! I have acne-prone combination skin and this product really helps keep my skin clear while also fading old acne marks. It's lightweight with a natural/non-greasy finish. The tube packaging is also perfect because it is so unsanitary to be sticking your fingers into a jar of cream for months! I recommend this product to normal, combination, oily, & acne-prone skin types. :)"
I've been using this product since my 20's (so almost 20 years now). My face is really sensitive and breaks out easily. I can only use certain products. This is one of them. I do notice a difference in my skin when I run out and don't replace it ASAP. So glad I can order online now.
"This is the best night cream I have EVER used. I was using a 3 step, plus serum and eye cream. AND with little to show for it. I bought this after do some research. This night cream kept coming in with HIGH REVIEWS. I have been using it for two weeks and I LOOK VISIBLY YOUNGER. Not just a little, YEARS."
My skin is extremely sensitive and tends to breakout from most anti-aging products on the market. This product has not only worked for clearing my skin up but it changed the texture of my skin for the better. This is an excellent product and I hope Neutrogena will continue making it.
"I tried a different product for a while and it did not work. I have been using this twice a day for 3 weeks and what a difference on my skin tone! I believe the packaging said it would take 8 weeks to see a difference, No Way, 3 weeks and brown spots are greatly diminished. I use a SPF 30 over it during the day. I'm back Neutrogena and thank you very much!"
"I have been using this for several years now, and I constantly get complements on my skin. This product is easy to use for a retinol product, its silky smooth not at all greasy and it doesn't cause allergic reactions or red patches like some retinol creams. I highly recommend it....and I have spent 10 times more on expensive creams. This is better HANDS DOWN."
This must have just the right amount of retinol because my skin did not become irritated as with other retinol creams. It makes my skin look much younger (43 looking 30) softer and my fine lines have almost disappeared as well as my dark spots. I use the Ageless anti-oxidant night cream over it so that my skin does not dry out and during the day I wear Visibly Even SPF30. I am so pleased with the result.
"i never wrote a review for nothing im using but this time i must !! i tried many anti wrinkles night creams , none works...some even made it worst. i found this one , after a few nights im in shock ! my skin looks amazing !! soft ! the wrinkles are 70% gone ! my skin tone looks amazing ! im using also the eye cream from the same line and i would stick to them for life ! thanks neutrogena !!"
"... and doesn't cost a fortune! My dermatologist recommended this otc product to me for fine lines, wrinkles and age spots. I'm 38 years and and have been in the sun my entire life. I had an appointment to have a small raised sun damage spot on my face removed, and after using Neutrogena Anti Wrinkle Cream Night with Retinol for only 1 week, the spot was practically gone and I cancelled my appt. It did dry my face out a tiny bit the first few days, so I mixed it with a moisturizer. I just love it!"
After less than a week of nightly use I am already noticing major improvement in the way my skin looks and feels. As a pharmacist I did some research on which ingredients are important in facial moisturizers for slowing down of aging process and prevention of wrinkles. The evidence definitely points to retinol being the key to younger looking skin and this product contains it. I tried and it truly works! You will not be disappointed :-) my mom tried it and loves it too!
I have found this product to be amazing in its anti wrinkle properties. I have deep lines from my nose to mouth but otherwise not much wrinkling. Was not sure that this product would work for such deep wrinkles but it is gradually erasing them. I do have a question that I would like to be answered. Is it so be used only at night or can it be used in the daytime too?
"I have spent a fortunate in the past on topical products to help reduce wrinkles, and this is the only one that I has truly delivered visible results quickly! This gentle cream is a true miracle! Within the first couple days of use, I noticed diminished frown lines and an overall improvement in the appearance and texture of my skin. Thank you, Neutrogena! I will never doubt you again :)"
"I starting using this under my moisturizer at night. Within 3 days, I could see a difference. It looked like I was wearing cover-up when I really was not. No more redness in the cheeks, and a permanent red mark on my face is almost gone. My forehead wrinkles have faded considerably."
"I love this moisturizer. It's hydrating but not too rich for my acne-prone skin, and the retinol is a great bonus. What I didn't love was the packaging from Walmart. The box and the metal tube were crushed, because they were packaged in a flimsy mail bag. Really, Walmart? A bag? I'll buy this - and everything - elsewhere from now on."
I heard great things about using retinol. After the first day of using this I saw a difference my face was dooey when I woke up very oily on my nose which was great because after 3-4 days my black heads on my nose cleared up. Yea it wakes your face oily at night but once you wash you face in the morning it looks great. Also its very moisturizing and the tube has lasted m forever I'm creeping around my second month on the first tube and I use it every night(well5 times a week)
My sister has been wearing this product for 7 years and is 26 and looks 23. I started using it after I took a look at her palms and saw how she had no wrinkles on them! I compared them with mine and she definately had more than I do and we have almost the exact same hands! It is from using her hands to put the cream on! And i love how it absorbs quickly and is a great moisturizer!
"I am 67 years old. I had been using a product and really was not unhappy. Thought I would try your anti wrinkle night cream. OMG! It burnt my face. After 4-5 days it is still red and peeling. No more Neutrogena for me!!!! you don't have to post this, but you should be informed about what it has done to me."
this retinol cream is gentle enough for me to use every night. it has smoothed out the crease between my eyebrows and has improved the over-all texture of my skin making it look more refined and smooth. i will try the salicylic acid one next as i have an issue with blackheads.
"My skin care regimen consist of various products that scored the ""Best"" on the Paula's Choice Beautypedia Reviews. This was one of those products. It's just what my skin was missing! My pores are shrinking! Brown spot is fading and most importantly for me is that this formula is moisturizing enough for my dry thirsty skin."
"This is an excellent cream. I have been using it for about a year with great results. I have purchased much more expensive creams and this one is every bit as good if not better, and it is a great value. No irritation, its easy to use and light feeling on the skin. Highly recommend...."
I've been using this product for about a year and my skin looks 1000x better! My face cleared up and doesn't feel dry like it did when I used the competitors anti-wrinkle creams. It was a perfect introductory product and I'll be switching to Neutrogena's retinol line.
I've never used another retinol cream to compare but this one works great. Smoother skin and fine lines reduced.
I started using this over the winter because winter wrecks my skin. It took about a month to make a visible difference but what a difference it made! My skin looks great and it continues to improve with daily use. This product is worth the cost.
"Neutrogena facial products do exactly what they say they will do. I have been using them, along with the microdermabrasion tool, for decades."
"I've been buying this for a long time. In the last month, I noticed a change and looked at the back of the box. Retinol is now dead last in the list of ingredients."
I bought the wrinkle nite cream used it for 2 days my face around my cheeks were swollen and my skin around my mouth was so dry and pealing and my was stinging too bad product I do not recommend this is anyone.
"This is the best skin cream. It leaves my skin soft. The texture is great, it's not too thick, and not too greasy. And it's so reasonably priced. I love it."
I needed to find cosmetic products at a more reasonable price. I was extremely please with how wonderful my skin looks and feels with this product! I wish I switched to Neutrogena products sooner!
"I have combo skin. I have been using this product for some time now. It absorbs wonderfuly, no geasy feel ever for being a cream. I dont break out either. Thanks for making this. Please DO NOT GET RID OF THIS PRODUCT!"
"I have been using this cream for at least 8 yrs. If I try something else I always come back to healthy skin Neutrogena. It works and feels great on my skin, besides filling in the wrinkles it also puts a glow in my skin."
I apply this moisturizer every night. It feels lovely on my skin. I like that it absorbs instantly and doesn't leave a greasy residue. You only to need to use a very small amount.
"Ever since I bought this cream, my face looks so good now and I have less wrinkles. I wear it every night after I wash my face. Since it has only been a week since I got it, I am sure in more time I won't have any wrinkles."
I have been using cream daily for about two weeks. I have noticed less wrinkles and age spots. Wish it did more for bags under my eyes. Only use a pearl size amount so it will last awhile. Non-greasy. Makes my face soft. I highly recommend
"After trying numerous night creams on the market, I've tried Neutrogena and have not changed since. I love the way my skin looks, I'm 46 and have lines and wrinkles. They have diminshed over a couple of weeks."
"I use this day and night. It's not oily, doesn't burn, can be used under eyes for bags and makes my skin smoother and brighter. The only product I like better is the anti-wrinkle/anti-blemish but it's never in stock anywhere."
Bought this product after reading so many positive reviews. I use this moisturizer almost every night. It makes my skin really soft. Was wondering if I could use a serum prior to using this moisturizer.
"I will never not use this. I've received so many compliments on my skin since I first started this product. It is smooth, scentless, and you can tell in the morning that it was on. Please Neutrogena...do not stop selling this!"
Good retinol cream. Nice moisture without being greasy even on my very oily skin. I do have sensitivity to the liquid serum but not this. I'm looking forward to future benefits. I apply once at night.
I've used Neutogena for over 30 years and this is my favorite product in their line. My skin feels so good because of this cream. I highly recommend it for your skin.
"I love this basic retinol cream! I have very sensitive skin and it burned at first. I started using it once a week and built up to every other day. I still cannot believe how it has worked so well. I have sun damage and it has improved my skin so much! Even better, it is DrDray approved! You will need to use a moisturizer first. My choice is Cerave moisturizing cream."
Excellent product . I really recommended !
Light weight and works well - also great price at walmart.
I have been using another product (the one brand that seems to take up most of the space in every store) and did not like how that felt on my skin and the smell was not pleasing. So far (4 days) this feels much much better and it seems to be doing as well as the other. And no smell. Great stuff. Would give a five if it continues to please in a month or so
Why did you change your formula and put Retinol last? The product is not as effective and still cost the same price. Disappointed!
"This is the best out there. It even competes with higher priced lines. Don't waste your money on expensive Retinol creams, this one is great!"
"I have been using some of your products for awhile, mostly your sensitive skin products, including your sun creams."
I love the Healthy skin anti-wrinkle cream-Night and anti-wrinkle spf 15. I am prone to break outs so I also like that it's oil free!
I am very pleased with this product. My skin feels so smooth. Please get the face scrub for this line back in stock.
"I am super impressed with everything about this product- from the ingredients, to the smell/feel and the results."
Have used this for several months and have much smoother skin with fewer wrinkles. Does a wonderful job making me look younger.
I'm 35 years old. i have overall good skin. i started using this product in hopes of continuing my good skin and preventing wrinkles as i age. i used it for about a week and started noticing fine lines under my eyes! I stopped using it.
Great
I love it.
this product is amazing I have seen results that far surpass very expensive creams
THIS WORKS!!! Use it daily! Dont ever stop and you will see results. It gets better every day!
It makes my skin healthier. I have been using it for years.
Just a little goes a long way to night moisturizing.
Feels great. Clean and refreshing. Very sensitive.
Make ur face feel super soft
All items returned due to damage in shipping.
This product makes my face so soft but I see no difference. I probably need to give it more time.
I've been using this at night for almost a week and it cleared these stubborn blemishes I had on my forehead. My skin is softer and the texture has improved. I love it!
"The night cream filled in the lines around my mouth right away which is really surprising since they're deep. I've only seen a very minor change on my eye and forehead wrinkles. So, I'm using this more as a preventative in those areas. Its not greasy and didn't aggravate my acne at all. I'm not sure after only one week, but I think its actually helping my acne. The only downside is that it burns if used on the eye area. I do it anyway tho to avoid buying a separate eye cream."
I just started using this cream for a weeks now and my skin feels so much better now it does not feel dry anymore.
Highly rated product by various impartial cosmetic reviewers and I have been using it for 3 years. Very emollient product that includes retinol. I use overnight and under makeup during day. Love it.
"I used this under my eyes and after just two nights I now look like a 90-year-old! I realize this typically dries out skin, but I have far more and far deeper wrinkles than before, and my skin feels (and looks) like parched desert! As a younger-looking 50-year-old, I hope my skin is not permanently damaged!"
"My rating was based on the claims that you would get some results from this cream. This is a nice refined cream and that is it. Did not have great expectations that it would help wrinkles, fine or deep, but had some hope. A Dermatologist once told me that no over the counter wrinkle cream works on wrinkles. A waste of your dollars."
I have used this product for quite a while--Walmart has the best price.
"One of the best retinal face creams I've tried. Removes fine lines and rough skin for a smooth, even face."
"The product is light and smooth. It absorbs well. However, I don't see much of a change in my skin. My problem is the packaging. The tube is a metal substance. It"
is difficult to squeeze. You are definitely leaving product in the tube.
Love Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinklr cream. Big fan!!!!
"Great cream! Quickly absorbing, leaves my skin smooth."
"Non greasy, lightweight formula and you can feel the slight tingling from the vitamins working."
Fan of this Nutragena. My wife uses it too. We can tell the difference when we don't use it.
"This is my 3rd time buying this, so it must be doing something."
Skin looks and feels great in just a few minutes after aplication. Love it!
Great product!!
I've only used it one night and so far my face feels so moisturized and fine lines are already minimized. Can't wait to continue using it.
i dont think this item is working at all. my fine wrinkles are still there.. disappointed.
I feel awesome when using this. Improvement is seen by the time.
It's good
