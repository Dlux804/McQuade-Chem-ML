"I'm glad to have found this online. I have used it for years, and was surprised to see it missing from the large display of Neutrogena products at our drugstore when I last shopped for it."
"I have been using this for almost 20 years everyday, I love it. It is so light but gives me some sun protection as well as helping keep my face/skin healthy."
"I've tried many face moisturizer products, many from Oil of Olay to L'Oreal to Estee Lauder and I keep coming back to this Neurtogena product, Healthy Skin with Sunscreen. It moisturizes my face well, does not have any unpleasant odors, and is reasonably priced."
I have sensitive skin and have had trouble finding a lotion with sun screen I don't itch or break out from. I also enjoy the added benefit of the retinol. I do notice the sun protect and the benefits this cream claims to have. I like it.
I have been using this product for years and still love it.
I have been applying this cream for about a week and it's probably the best I have used. Not at all greasy and just a little will cover your entire face/neck. It absorbs very easily -- very light weight. Have noticed my skin becoming firmer and knowing that it has SPF is simply a bonus. Far better than several others that cost more as well. Neutrogena overall brings good products to the consumer.
This is great for me. I have a very oily t zone and the rest is dry in cold months and normal in warm months. This lotion is perfect for me. When its cold here I just put on another lotion over this one for the extra dryness of my skin.
"I have used this product since 1998 as my primary moisturizer. The last tube I purchased made my skin sting and has a very unpleasant scent (similar to the scent in the sunscreen line...which also stings my skin). Please, please change back to the old formula. After so many years of dedicated use I am sad to have to look for a new anti-wrinkle cream, but with the currant formula I am left with no other choice."
"I have been using this product since it first came out and I have loved it all these years. The new formula is more watery, less thick, and I do not like it. Please bring back the original formula for the many of us on here who obviously do not like the change! Before the formula change, this would have been a 5 star rating."
"Since you changed the formula for Healthy Skin Anti-wrinkle Cream, even though I used the new formula exactly as I used the old, I started to have wrinkles. At first I told myself, it is age, get over it. Then I found an old tube of the original. After using it for a few days, no more wrinkles! Really. Why would you take something that works off the market in favor of something that does not. Please bring it back. Charge more if you must, but make it available for those of us who want it."
I have bought the original formula for years. I am 47 years old and I am told that I look like I'm in my 30's. I know it is because I have used the original formula for several years. I loved the original product so much that both of my children (ages 22 and 18) started using it and they loved it also. We are very unhappy that the formula has changed. We have tried it and we will not be buying the new formula again. PLEASE bring back the original formula. We do not like the new broad spectrum formula.
"Hello, I started using the anti wrinkle cream original formula since the day it was on the market many years ago- My skin looked beautiful and I had finally found the product that smelled, felt and reacted perfectly. I absolutely hate the new replacement. It smells aweful and my skin has broken out constantly. As someone 50+ this is very disturbing. I will now have to search for something different after all these yrs. This is very depressing."
"I have been using this product for over 5 years and I am 62 years old. My skin looks like I am in my 40s, according to comments I get. I live in a 55+ community and am often asked for my ID, when I use the facilities as they think I am a younger visitor. I am a realtor and have had clients sheepishly ask how old I am, as they think I am too young to live here. I love this product!!"
"Neutropenia is replacing the Original Formula Anti-Wrinkle Cream with a new formulation. I like the Original Formula & was excited that Walmart advertised that this product was the original formula. When the product came, it was NOT the ORIGINAL FORMULA. Instead, it was the new formulation. Walmart need to check their product advertisement & ensure it truly reflects the product it is distributing!"
"I used this years ago when it was new, and I wa sin my early 20's. I knew it was incredible when I was visiting a friend and got up in the am to wash my face, and because of the different lighting, I could literally see a line under my eye where I stopped using the cream (I only used it under my eyes at that time and not on my face). Under my eye was smooth and right below it wasn't as smooth. There was literally a line where I didn't apply it. I was shocked. It really does work."
"I have been using this product for years and have loved it! However, this last time I bought it you changed the the scent and it is stinky! It is so bad that I have to hold my breath to use it and wash my hands right afterwards. Please! Please change it back without the smell."
"If I were to rate the ""original"" formula, I would give an enthusiastic five-star rating. But that product has been replaced with a ""Broad Spectum"" cream that is just not the same. The odor is strong and unpleasant, and my skin is less smooth, and seems irritated - like I'm always in the verge of a breakout. Please bring back the ORIGINAL formula!"
i just purchased a new tube and noticed the spf scent was over powering. I use this product because the spf scent was so minimum. I even recommended this to a friend. I'm sorry I did now. I have used this product for many years (8). Would like the old formula back.
"I have been using this product for years and I'm so upset that the original formula is no longer available . I tried to use the new formula, but it's no where near the same . I broke out pretty bad from the new formula . I don't understand why they would change such a good product into such a bad one . Makes me question their whole line of products now."
"This lotion does what it says, but way faster than the four weeks as stated on the bottle! From day one my skin looked and felt fresher. Yes, it will sting a little when you first start using it. That's how you know it's working!! The SPF ingredients do make it feel a little heavy or greasy. I plan to try the ""night"" version with no SPF. I'm 39 and have been very aggressive with keeping my skin young since my twenties. Because of this, I still can pass for a twenty-something even as I approach the big 4-0!"
"I have tried to use retinol several times but it just lead to super irritated skin. I did however like the result so I tried this version. It must have the right amount of retinol in it because my eyes and lips did not get puffy and my skin after 2 weeks or so ended up looking smooth, soft, youthfull and my darkspots have almost disappeared. Not bad for a 42 year old who needed a major skin restorative cream. Oh it also removed my fine lines. It's a keeper!"
"This cream must have the right amount of retinol in it becuase it did not give me an allergic reaction as other retinol creams have done. So I can still enjoy the benefits of retinol, my dark spots and fine lines have disappeared and it seemed to have plumped my skin giving it a healhty glow. Please do not d/c this one!"
"This cream goes on very smooth and even, and absorbs very quickly. It keeps my skin hydrated all day without feeling greasy at all. I also like that it has an SPF in it, so I know my skin is protected all day long. I have been using it for several years and will continue to do so as long as they keep making it!"
"I have used this product for many years as well as the rest of the Neutrogena retinol product line. A local dermatologist asked me what I was using on my face ... he was so impressed! Today my eye doctor asked the same question. At age 71, I am thrilled ... needless to say :) Neutrogena is way ahead of the competition. I can personally attest to that."
"I've used Neutrogena products for 30 plus years and I've never been disappointed. This cream is wonderful and makes my skin feel and look great. I've also tried their newer day and night creams, eye creams, cleansers, sunscreens, and I have never found a better brand including the expensive department store brands. I am forever devoted to Neutrogena."
"I used this for ~20 years with 5-star rating! New version both has horrible, lingering scent plus burns my skin. After giving it a fair try (completely used one bottle / started a second), sadly am searching for a replacement product that is fragrance- and pain-free! Good news is did find the 'night' version still available...please continue offering it."
"I started using this product over a year ago. I was in awe with how it made my skin looked, bright and youthful. I'm 42 and recently went to my doctor, as the nurse called me in she told me she cannot believe I was 42! She thought I was in my late 20's! After I was sent to my room, not only her but a few more nurses came to my room with pads and pens wanting me to write down what I was using - ""Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream SPF 15."""
"I purchased the new formula, the Broad Spectrum, and immediately went on a mission to find the Original Formula. I found two packages and hope they last until you bring back the Original Formula. I've used Neutrogena products forever. Just turned 60 and no wrinkles. My friends think I'm a freak of nature. I keep telling them it's this product. Would have given the Original Formula 5 stars, -1 for Broad Spectrum."
"Can't say whether it does anything for my wrinkles, time marches on, but it is the best overall cream for my face that I have found. It is the right weight and leaves my skin feeling fresh, not greasy. The spf 15 means that I'm protected all the time, for light sun exposure. And it isn't full of perfumes, a real plus."
I am 51 years old and have used another brand forever. I switched to Neutrogena because little lines are starting around my eyes and mouth. My usual product was doing nothing.After 2 weeks of Healthy Skin Anti-wrinkle moisturizer and Healthy Skin Enhancer I see less noticeable lines and skin feels soft. Pores look smaller. I have stopped using foundation. Skin enhancer is all I need.Thank you so much!
"I started using it because I was getting fine lines and I had uneven skin tone but I needed something with SPF in it. It worked great for my skin. After using it a while there were actually days when I felt confident enough to go to the store without makeup, which is a huge deal for me. Love it!"
"I have used this cream for years - non-greasy, no smell, leaves skin very soft and has a sunscreen - what more could you want? Recently tried the Neutrogena Firming Cream but will definitely go back to the Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream - great product."
"I love this product, it does help lines on my face. For me the best part is that its the least bit greasy. I used to use oil of olay and left my skin greasy and would even get into my eyes and it would . My only suggestion would be maybe a bigger tube."
"This is the best anti-wrinkle cream ever! I have been using it as a moisturizer under my makeup for several years. Immediately after I began using it; I was complimented on how glowy my skin looks! I love the original formula, Healthy Skin Anti-Wrinkle Cream with sunscreen SPF15, and never had any problems with my sensitive skin."
I have extremely sensitive skin and I am allergic to many products. This Healthy Skin anti-wrinkle cream with Retinol is the best one I have found after trying many. It feels good on my skin and I love it. It is not oily and absorbs nicely. Note that I only like the cream with Retinol. The other type Healthy Skin lotion without retinol burned my skin and I cannot use it.
Everyone needs somewhat of a moisture but with oily skin you have to be careful what you use. I have been using this product for 20+ years. It also has a SPF15 in it which is very important. So if I'm not wearing sun screen in the winter or cloudy day I at least have a SPF15 to protect my skin. This is not oily and works fast so you don't have to wait to put your makeup on.
The new replacement sunscreen actually irritates my skin. The original with the original sunscreen has been good. No irritation of any kind.. The newer broad spectrum sunscreen actually irritates my skin to the point of redness and feeling of burning.. Keep the original formula as it works well.
I have finished using my first tube of the Healthy Skin and my face has gotten so soft and the sun spots are fading. I also use the microdermabrasion system 3 times a week. Even my 4 year old daughter has noticed the difference. Thank you Neutrogena!
Take it from someone who suns in the summer and skis all winter!!!! My face has definitely been exposed to all weather elements and this cream is the BEST! I do add a little extra moisterizer in the winter to battle dryness from the furnace/fireplace. I'm in my 40s and people cannot believe it!
I have used this product for about 5 months and have noticed a definite difference in how clear my skin looks along with being so soft to the touch. I have areas that have sun damage (brown spots) this product has played a big part in making these spots lighten tremendously. I have tried laser treatments along with costly skin care products with not such good results.
"Hello, I was very excited to get the Rapid wrinkle repair. I bought it on Friday, I followed the directions. 2 times a day, AM & PM I skipped a day because it didn't feel right around my eyes. Today is Wednesday. When I woke up this morning my eyes were so painful, swollen, red, and hurt to the touch. Feels like a burn. Please tell me is there something I can do ?"
"I bought the Neutrogena Rapid Wrinkle Repair Cream and took it back after one use. The cream has a burnt smell to it, I continued to smell it for 15 minutes after I applied to my face. It was so bad I returned it. I wanted to check the ingredients, to see what it may be, but the ingredients do not show on the package."
"Chose product for anti-wrinkle, SPF and moisturizer factors. Label states ""Anti-wrinkle cream"" with SPF and multi-vitamins, however, active ingredients listed are basically for sunscreen and the one and only ""Purpose"" is ""Sunscreen"". Guess I was misled as I was looking for a good moisturizer versus sunscreen."
I've used this powder for years. It is perfect. Provides an awesome all-over finisher to my routine.
"I have never written a review before, but I really loved the original formula and have used it for years. the new one is much heavier and has an odor to it. Please bring back the original formula!"
"I've been using this cream since I was out of college ~22 years old. It's been 19 years and this is still my daily face lotion, the first thing I do after I dry off out of the shower - I put this on my face."
"A plastic surgent recommended using this cream 8 years ago. I have used it daily ever since. I believe it has made a difference in my skin, since I decided not to have plastic surgery."
"Be careful of using this cream if you have sensitive skin. My face became red and very dry after 3 days from using it, and now I have wrinkles!! although I am only 24 years old and used it to prevent wrinkles in the future!"
I am 64 years old and have been using this cream for a year now. It definitely has slowed the process of fine lines - will use it as long as Neutrogena sells this product.
"I've been using this product for 3 years, and it has kept my skin free of age spots (I am 73 years old). I hope Neutrogena will continue to manufacture it!"
I have been using this for three months. I love it. My crows feet are just about invisible and my skin is so smooth. I use the night one too. I am 48. Thankyou for such a good product. I also am al;lergic to scents and this has NO smell!
I am 39 but have noticed some unevenness and a few fine lines. Within a week of using this my skin's texture is much more even and lines have already visibly diminished. I am an avid fan and will use this product as long as they make it!!
"I have been using this particular product for years, and love it. I get a lot of compliments on my skin (I'm 64) I've used other products at times but ALWAYS come back to this one. It is the BEST!"
"i have used this product for years and think it's great. Please do not do away with the ""original formula"". The newer one makes my eyes and skin burn. I have not been able to find the original formula recently."
I really recommend this product I'm 50 years old and this product help me for wrinkles and sun spots and belive me I have no wrinkles I been using it for 1 year
Great product! This is my first week and my skin looks great! I have very sensitive skin and trouble with most brands and types of skin products. It really works for me!!
"I have been using this product for about 10 years. I have tried several other products on the market and keep coming back to this one. It is light, clean, and doesn't leave my skin looking oily. Thanks Neutrogena! Great product."
I started using this product 10 years ago when i moved to U SA. I have now moved to India and have ordered it to be shipped to me in India. Because this product really works! Fine lines and wrinkles are truly hidden.
"i have been using this product happily for over 10 years. it DID NOT irritate skin or SMELL BAD; sadly, it DOES BOTH NOW. not sure why the change to a proven and well regarded product, but im sure it has something to do with dollars and cents!"
I have been using this for about 6 months.You can barely see my crows feet any more and my skin looks so much better. Also I cannot use scents and this is unscented!
This cream is awesome! Apply at night before bed and in the morning on a clean face and it will make wonders! I recommend it to anyone and even those who don't have wrinkles yet!
"I first purchased this product back in January and when I tried it out the first day, I immediately saw results! I was shocked! and also I have really sensitve skin so from now and on I will still use these wonderful products!!"
"Swear by this cream, notice a difference if I don't wear it. Won't put makeup on without it. Love how it makes my skin look and feel. No one believes I'm 50, yay!"
It's a great product and hard to find. Love it
Best prices in town--Thanks Walmart for being there for us who can't shop at the expensive stores.
"Great retinol cream! After about 3-4 weeks of nightly use, it makes my skin smoother and does noticeably reduce small lines around my eyes and on my forehead. I am not a believer in most 'anti-aging' creams, but after using this one I am hooked. Highly recommend. One tube lasts for months."
Aparently the formula change because I used for 5 years perfect and now I have a rashes in my face produced by the retinol..
I have been using this for years and loving it. Now they've changed it and It's irritating and thick and smells gross. Moving on to another company.
Just a little dab each day under makeup and your skin just glows! Sure helps my skin stay hydrated in this dry Arizona climate.
"I have been using this cream for 17 years, everyday, and get compliments on my skin and that I don't look nearly my age. I love it!"
"This lotion is great. Specially for an oily t-zone. Finally, a lotion with retinol that isnt loaded with oil."
I've been looking for a good facial cream/lotion and I'm allergic to all products which contain fragrance. So this product has proved perfect for me.
"I love this product, it penatrates so fast and is great under makeup, I would recommend to everyone. Hopefully it will help with my wrinkles and make me look 10 years younger-----but time will tell, I just started using it last week."
"I am 62 and my friends tell me that I look like I am in my 40""s. I use it as a night cream and under my make-up during the day. I like the fact that it has a SPF of 15 for protection and has Retinol. I have used this product for years and I don't have any wrinkles. People notice that about me. I recommend this product to all my friends."
I have changed my original product to Neutrogena and for an 85 year old I look pretty darn good!
"Non greasy, won't make your skin breakout, Feels soft on skin, improved my fine lines"
try the eye AND NIGHT CREAM TOO
"feels great, skin's smooth and it doesn't smell too much like sunscreen"
Very light and soft on skin!! Good buy and worth it!!
Ive been using this lotion for years. Ive tried many others. I keep coming back to this one.
tried others but can't do what this product can! my face never looked so good......
I love this Neutrogena cream and use it every day.
I bought this and have been using it for 3 weeks and its done nothing.
Gentle and yet prevents wrinkles. I've used it for approximately 30 years. Everyone thinks I'm 10 years younger than I am.
"Applied a thin layer to my face, hours later face turned red and started burning. Going on 2 days now. This stuff should be pulled from the market. Mine's in the trash."
"I like it. It seems to help my dry skin. As far as the anti aging goes, it does as good as any I have found. I like the fact it has Retinol. I have been using it for years."
"My husband loves this product, but would like to buy it in a bigger tube or container. Do they make such a thing? We have to run to the store too often because we both use it and run out too quickly."
I am very pleased with this product! I had been using the anti-blemish anti-wrinkle combination product but could not find it anymore. This works just as well. Please don't discontinue this product.
"I use this every day. It is great! My skin is softer and smoother since I started using it. It is hard to find though. Luckily I found it on the WalMart website. The store carried it at one time; however, I cannot find it at the WalMart stores anymore. The only problem with ordering it online - the shipping costs are added unless you buy enough to exceed the $50 threshold for free shipping. Otherwise you have to pay for something you used to be able to get in the store with no shipping required."
"I bought this product on July 28th and started using it. I started itching and burning, but I thought I had to get use to the product. After a week it got worse and now my face and neck feels rough and have rashes. I have used neutropenia products for years, but this one is bad!!!"
"I use both the night and the day formulas. I never use anything else and it brought me over to all of the neutrogena products. I use the sunblock, cream with spf during the day, the night cream and the liquid foundation. I can't believe this has been reformulated! I have to go and stock up!"
I use this every day under my foundation make up. It works great! I had it on one sunny day that I stayed out in too long. I got sunburned on my forehead. That was the only place I had not applied this cream so I know it works great at blocking out harmful rays from the sun.
"I have now officially used a full tube of this product, and I STILL have the fine lines under my eyes that were there when I first began using it. I am 42 years old and am just now starting to show signs of aging under my eye area.I paid a little extra for this product due to the fact that it was a well known name brand. For my next purchase, I believe I will be buying the less expensive Equate products. I seem to have more luck with those."
works wonders on my skin
"This product works wonders for fine lines, dark circles, and uneven skin tone."
is not the greatest cream I´ve tried but I´m still giving a try I have used just for 2 weeks but probably in winter time works different than the rest of the year.
I have been using this anti wrinkle cream for years. It is very gentle and really does help dimish fine lines and wrinkles. I get compliments on how good my skin looks all the time.
"Love this face cream! Within a day or two of using it, your skin is noticeably softer and after about a month of continuous use, my skin looks very smooth and evenly toned. Fine lines aren't as noticeable anymore."
"I used the night cream which doesn't SPF, and it works fine. I bought this one without reading the description and reviews carefully, and it did burn my face!"
I have been using for more than 8 years then I stopped for about 5 years. I have age spots now a I have gone back to the product healthy skin it is the best ever .
Fabulous moisturizer!
I based my ratings on claims that this cream would reduce some wrinkles. It is a nice refined cream and has sun screen but that is it. Many companies make the promise of reducing wrinkles but I have seen no real benefit from these creams. At there cost it is a waste of money.
"I bought this thinking it was general skin cream not face cream. Accordingly, I expected a bigger tube. I always use a new product on only one side to evaluate its worth. I used the cream twice daily on my left forearm and back of my left hand. After using the entire tube in a few weeks, there is dramatically less wrinkling on the left arm and hand than on the right."
I bought this cream to try and absolutely love it! This will be my 3rd time purchasing and I feel like my skin has completely changed for the better. I use this cream after i take a shower at night and then in the morning before I apply makeup. I consider this cream a MUST HAVE and as part of my daily routine.
Is this the same as Men Age Fighter face moisturizer?? If so its great used it for years
I have used the Heathy skin product for yeas and it for me is better tan Mary Kay.
did not even skin tone. I can only use it on my forehead because it makes me break out. I think it may have reduced the wrinkle on my forehead.
"I have used this product for 2 days and my skin is so soft. It's winter and I usually have dry, flaky skin but the last 2 days have been wonderful. My skin is moist and soft and the best part is the cream is so light and non-greasy!"
I have used this product for 2 months and I can't see that it has helped the appearance of my skin whatsoever... In fact I believe that my skin is a little dryer.. I give up on this product.
I've used this for years and been told I don't look 68!!!!
My dermatologist recommended this product. Have not regretted taking that advice.
It really smooth's out your skin and wrinkles diminish even after the first use.
"Very good product, my face tingles as soon as I put it on!"
"My review is tentative because this is my 1st time using this product, and it has not had time to work yet. check back in 6 months."
best day cream ever
