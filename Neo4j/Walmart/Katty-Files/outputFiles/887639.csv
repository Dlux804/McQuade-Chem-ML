"I have been using this product for years, love it. I have sensitive skin and it being oil free, really works well for me. It doesn't break my face out like other moisturizers do. Plus it keeps my face from getting sunburn. Great product!"
This is such an excellent moisturizer. I can't remember the last time a drugstore moisturizer didn't break me out - I regret not trying it sooner!
"Not greasy, highly moisturizing, non irritating - highly recommend :)"
"I am 72 years old can't use soaps on my face. Cleanse with water to clean face and then this moisturizer. This is the only cream that does not break me out. Have used for many years. Beautiful skin, radiant and glows."
"I recently bought this for my dry face. For me, I only like using lightweight moisturizers and this one is perfect. Its hydrating and is very light weight. I would recommend this to people with dry skin."
"I have been using this moisturiser on my face for around 15 years - it is light and easy to apply, really works on my very dry skin, keeping it feeling soft and supple all day."
This moisture is great for winter skin. I have not have any bad skin reaction since using this moisture. Its not greasy or your skin doesn't quickly.
I really like this moisturizer. It's my first time using it and it feels and smells great. It's light on my skin and does not weigh it down. I don't smell of the sunscreen because it is very faint.
"Even though the box said its oil-free, on my skin it still gets pretty oily just after 30 minutes of applying. In terms of hydration, my skin felt relatively moisturised and soft. Personally, I don't enjoy the scent."
I use to use this faithfully. But as other reviewers have commented this new formula is awful. It burns my skin. Had to find a new moisturizer because of this so now I use aveeno moisturizer and it is great. Neutrogena bring back the old formula or you will continue to lose customers for this product or do you even care how your use to be loyal customers feel.
"I wrote a review on this site stating how much I liked this product before the fragrance was added. You say there isn't one, but obviously a lot of people including myself disagree. Are we enough of a business loss to bring back the old formula? Please return to the old formula, so I don't have to look for something else to use on my face. Thanks"
"I have been using this product for years and loved it until the latest formula change- now it leaves my skin feeling greasy within a few hours. I am also unsure whether it provides UVA AND UVB protection like it used to, the new description is a little elusive. I am so disappointed that you tampered with what used to be a five star product."
I recently purchased this as i use the moisturizer without SPF. Worst mistake it caused me to break out made my cheeks red and itchy. This was the only thing i changed in my day to day routine. I put it away today and went back to the one without SPF. I have oily/ acne prone skin and this did not help!
"I have been a Neutrogena user for 20 years. With my most recent bottle of the oil-free with sunscreen, I have a burning sensation on the areas around my eyes. I noticed there is a new ingredient, Avobenzone, and it appears I am not the only one attributing the burning to this ingredient. I hope you take my feedback and that of others to make a change to this product."
"this new formula is burning my skin and eyes. like other reviewers i thought maybe I got a bad batch, but it wasnt. Please please change it back, I just pitched my new bottle in the garbage. I was a religous user of your formula for years. why mess with a good thing?"
"I can no longer use this product. Since they have added Avobenzone to the formula, my face burns badly when I use it. It also has a very strong sunscreen smell. I once loved this product because it did NOT have a strong smell. Why did Neutrogena not advertise that they were changing the formula? Looks like I'm in the market for a new brand of moisturizer. Farewell, Neutrogena. You really screwed up this time. Can I get my money back for the new bottle I just purchased that I do not intend to use???"
"Used product for over 6 years every day and “loved” Just bought a new bottle and face turned bright red and was burning. Red is not going away, face is on fire. I am not on any medication so that is not a factor. Very disappointed as I use to LOVE this product and recommend it. What happened?"
"Until a few months ago, this was my favorite, can't live without beauty product. Simple, effective, SPF 15 moisturizer perfect for my dry yet prone to sunburn skin. However, as others have noted, the switch to ""broad spectrum"" sunblock, which has a number of new ingredients that led to a HORRIBLE burning and itching sensation all over my face, along with a red rash. Stay away from this product!"
I too just opened a new bottle and had an immediate reaction to the new formulation. The new active ingredient appears to be the Avobenzine (1.5%). I also just realized that the Visibly Even daily moisturizer with sunscreen (SPF 30) that also caused a rash on my face also has Avobenzine (3%). The Visibly Even BB cream daily moisturizer with sunscreen (SPF 30) which does not cause any reaction does NOT have the Avobenzine. Please bring back the original formula!
"I recently purchased Neutrogena Oil-Free with sunscreen SPF 15 (I have used the product in the past and loved how light it felt on my skin). This time I put the product on and immediately felt my eyes start tearing up! By the end of the day my face felt hot, dry and itchy. I tried the product one more day and it was even worse! Today, I didn't use the product and my face is still itchy, tight feeling and feeling flushed! What did Neutrogena do to the formula!!"
"I used to call this my ""magic lotion"" because it was so good - it even helped heal a severe sunburn very quickly once. Now this ""fragrance free"" lotion smells like watermelon Jolly Ranchers and doesn't moisturize at all. PLEASE go back to the old formula."
"I opened a new bottle and thought it might be old since there was a definite unpleasant smell. However, after reading the other reviews, I realize that you have changed the ingredients. I use only fragrance free products and I am very disappointed in this new oil free moisture lotion that is certainly not fragrance free."
I have used the same Neutrogena moisturizer for YEARS. My mom and grandmother also used it. Now none of us can use it any more. The new bottle is completely different. It smells perfumey and it stings my skin when I put it on. I've never ever had a problem with this moisturizer before. Please bring back the old product! You've lost 3 lifetime users.
I have used the oil-free moisture with sunscreen for years and was surprised when I used the latest version. It caused irritation around my eyes which I have never had before. I then noticed that the active ingredients had changed. I am hoping that there is another moisturizer with sunscreen out there that will work for my sensitive skin!
"I agree with the other reviewers. The new product (broad spectrum SPF 15) smells horrible. I had used the old version since 1998 and LOVED IT! Why did you have to change it now??? Does the old formula still exist? I am very, very disappointed that this new formula has such a nasty odor. I will no longer buy it."
"Loyal customer for more than a decade, but the recent change in formula for this product causes a burning sensation. Definite change in active ingredients listed. Reportedly fragrance-free, but certainly has a fragrance now. Already called customer service. Sad to report I will no longer be using Neutrogena products."
"I've been using the oil-free moisture for a few years and loved it. My old bottle ran out a few days ago, and I am extremely upset because the formula is not the same! Immediately I noticed a fragrance that I'd never smelled before (which would be tolerable), but it's also burning my face. I, unfortunately, will not be able to keep using this product."
"I've been a long-time user of this product and, like so many others have said, I do NOT like the changes they've made to the formula. First, you're hit with a highly unpleasant odor then moments later the stinging and burning begins. I, too, thought maybe I got a bad batch so I bought another bottle and unfortunately experienced the same issues. I'm sorry to say I have to break up with you, Neutrogena. I can't put my skin through this any longer."
Something has definitely happened to my face since using this the last week. What happened? The smell is different and I have bumps all over my face. I am terribly disappointed. Please return to old ingredients - I cannot continue to use this product with a bumpy face. I've used this product for at least 10 years. What a shame.
"I have been using this product for many years and loved it. The old formula was fragrance free-but the new formula surely cannot be. I have also started breaking out which is not normal for me. The back of the old bottle used to say ""won't clog pores, alcohol free, hypoallergenic, and fragrance free"" but the new bottle does not. Why change a product that was so great?"
"I have used this for years as my main face lotion and will continue to. I like that this is lightweight while getting the job done, not thick like many face lotions. I have olive skin and the spf is just the right amount. Very happy, wouldn't change a thing!"
I have gone to great lengths to buy this product over the years as I moved back to UK from USA 15 years ago. Very disappointed with recent purchase - thought I had ordered the wrong one as smell and product is different. Now realise it is a totally different product and my skin is very red after using.
"Living in Arizona and outside walking my dogs, I am also looking for a sunscreen that does not feel oily or heavy on my skin. The oil-free moisture with sunscreen is the best choice for me. I need all the mositureizing and sunscreen protection I can get and to have it feel good on is just a plus."
"I have been using this product for about 15 years. It has always worked well. I'm guessing the new formula has cheaper ingredients, or else why would you change it? Sorry if I sound mad, it's just that I can't use this product any more with the new formula. You lost a loyal customer. Honestly, I would much rather pay a dollar or so more for the original formula than not have it avaliable at all."
"I've used this product for years. I typically apply after showering each morning. I used to be really pleased with the product but after receiving my latest bottle, something is different about the formula. It smells of fragrance and irritates my skin and can make my eyes water. Bring back the old formula, please. Currently looking for better product."
"Have used this prod. for years. Recently my skin became very itchy, puffy, red. It was diagnosed as contact dermatitis and the doctor asked which skin products I was using... I thought Neutrogena was reliable.... However, when I came to this website, I learned that the formula had changed. Did some research and discovered ""oxybenzone"" has a high rate of SKIN ALLERGY (Environmental Work Group website, Dermatology Times, 1/16/11). Very disappointed with this company. I now have to deal with this dermatitis..."
"Why did you have to change a good thing? This new formula is horrible, it not only leaves my skin feeling sticky it stings. I used the old formula for years and never had a problem. I have read some of the reviews and pretty much the new formula is not liked. I do not like the smell either. Bring back the old formula. I am going to have to find a different product now."
"I have used this bottle of what used to be ""heaven"" on my face. I recently ran out and bought a new bottle. After a couple times of usage, I thought the product was expired because it made my skin burn, turn red, and super irritated when in the sun. I am sad after reading reviews Iv learned this product has changed. I am also upset at this company for not advertising this change. It is unfair. One more customer lost. What a shame."
"In response to a question about this product, a Neutrogena representative told me that this is in fact a reformulation of this product. I loved the old formula for my face and neck. The new one is thick and sticky--feels like ""regular"" sunscreen. I will not buy it again."
"I have been using this product for over 20 years. I just bought a new bottle. I didn't know that the formula had changed, but I did notice that there is a scent now . I prefer no scent. But the biggest thing is that this formula stings my face, especially under my eyes. I' m glad that I went to your website, because I now know that I' m not the only one with this problem. I hate to have to look for a new product. Please bring back the old formula!!!"
"I've had horrible breakouts on my face after using this product. My skin gets rough and bumpy, peels and then turns red. I've used it on and off to make sure it was the factor and indeed once I stopped using it for a while, my skin started clearing up - although it took at least a week to do so."
"I have been using this product for years and have always liked it until now. I don't know if it has been re-formulated but when I replenished my stock this week, I did notice that the bottle size has changed. For the first time ever, the product caused burning when I applied it and today I look like I am sunburned. So disappointing. I guess I will need to find a new moisturizer."
"I have used this product for years - it is the ONLY thing I found that I could use twice daily with no problem at all. I recently bought a new bottle. It made my face red and made it burn. It says it is fragrance free, but my bottle certainly has a fragrance! I thought I purchased the wrong thing. Double checked and bought a 2nd bottle. Same result. I'm so sad - it must have changed. I have to find something new - what's up Neutrogena??"
"I have been using this product daily and faithfully for over 20 years. Now I can no longer use it. Immediately after applying, my face turns bright red, burns and itches like crazy - almost like the moisturizer is triggering rosacea. I am disappointed and ticked off. I won't be buying this stuff ever again."
"i bought this a week ago after reading a few reviews from other sufferers of oily skin. they said it was amazing for controlling oil and moisturizing. the fragrance i could get past but the fact that after only 2 days i began to breakout in terrible acne was shocking. it goes on and actually stings, which i've felt from a probiotic cream before so i wasn't initially concerned but after the breaking out i immediately stopped using this."
"I've been using this for a few years, and just recently bought a new bottle. For some reason the new formula is (strangely) scented and feels really thick and greasy on my skin. I've had great results with the old formula, but the new formula is causing breakouts. Please go back to the old formula!"
"I am heartened to see that all the top posts are saying the same thing I'm thinking. I've used this product for over a decade, every time after I shower. I immediately noticed the new fruity smell. Stupid. But worse is that it's making my face splotchy. Why change a good thing? It would be nice to see a real response on this page rather than the autoresponse advice to call and talk to some customer rep. Sadly I'll start looking for a new product."
"I have used this moisturizer twice a day seven days a week for about twenty years and loved it. My face always felt good after using it. I just bought the moisturizer yesterday ...used it...my face felt dry and burned terribly. I also don't like the smell of it. What a disappointment after loving it all these years! Please, please bring the old formula back ."
"In short, I love this product. I have been using it for years and will continue to repurchase it again and again. As a NYC fashion model, good skin is quintesential to my living. I have normal skin that is sensative to fragrances and gets dull, flaky patches in the winter. Every morning after cleasing I use this moisturizer to restore some balance and bounce to my skin. It's not too thick, too thin, too heavy, too anything... It's just right:) It's my reliable go-to."
"I have very oily skin and this product appealed to me because how it was ""oil-free"" and plus it had some SPF in it. I've been using it for two months and it is the worst product ever! It leaves my skin oily and it felt as if my skin is suffocating. I also started breaking out on places where I never break out. In addition to my blackheads, I even got whiteheads from using this product! Worst product ever!"
"I like the fact that it has SPF 15 and is oil-free, but I still found it to be a bit greasy, which I just do not like. I have mainly dry skin that is a bit oily and sensitive. I think this product would be good for really dry skin, but other than that I find it to be a bit too greasy for my liking. The moisture it provides is fine, but feels more like an oily type of moisture. Bottom line, I will be moving on to a different product in the future and will not be repurchasing."
"i cant believe theres actually people reviewing this moisturiser saying it smells a little like sunscreen - it has an SPF.. what do you expect? in saying that, i can only smell the sunscreen resemblence when i first put it on, after a few minutes it completely goes away for me, maybe people are putting way too much on. its very light, and id reccommend only using one or two pumps, thats the perfect amount for me to cover my face, neck and chest area. its a great product and id reccommend it."
"Have relied on your old formulation for 15 years and always get compliments on my skin. New one has awful scent (fake watermelon?!?) and irritates my skin. I bought out all the old formulations I could find a year ago but now am down to last bottle. I will not use the new one again, and am about to go on hunt for new daily moisturizer. Please, Neutrogena, explain what happened here. Or is there a replacement product I could try instead???"
"I had been using the combination skin formula from this brand (with impressive results) for quite some time, and decided to switch over to this for the SPF. However, my skin has not adjusted well to the change at all. Within a week I started breaking out a LOT along my cheeks & chin, and within a few hours after each application my face looks like an oil slick and I need to rewash. Will be switching back to the combination skin formula as soon as I can."
"I have been using this product for years and I loved that it didnt have a smell. I bought the new formulated product but barley opened it today because I still had some of the old one. I didnt have any reaction to it yet,but did notice the smell and hated it. That alone makes me not want to purchase this product anymore. I thought I had bought the wrong one. I have psoriasis and sensitive skin. If anyone fines anything like this product before the change please let me know. Thank You."
"I have been using this product everyday for almost 10 years now, but am so disappointed in the new formula. It stings when I apply it, and my skin turns red and blotchy. I haven't found another neutrogena item that is a suitable replacement, so I will need to switch to a different brand. Please bring the old formula back!"
I have used this product for over 10 years and will not be buying another bottle. The new formula for the product causes my face to have an allergic reaction. The smell of the new formula is very off-putting and my skin starts burning as soon as the product touches my skin. I am at a loss as to what to try next as I loved the old formula. Please switch the formula back!
"I've used Neutrogena SPF 15 face lotion for almost 20 years. I picked up more from store and used it this week. The smell, the texture, the burning feeling on my skin was horrible! I then looked at the bottles. This new formula says ""Broad Spectrum SPF 15"" and the ingredients are changed. I'm glad to know other users are not liking this new formula. Neutrogena--bring back the old SPF 15 face lotion! Totally disappointed and can't use this new formula."
"I am trying your other products after being a loyal user of the intensified day cream for many years. This product is more liquid than cream and has a slight smell to it. I am sensitive to smells (sneezing, allergy, headaches). Sorry Neutragena but will be looking for other brands that are like the intensified day cream product you wrongly discontinued. cm"
I've been searching for an oil-free moisturizer with SPF that doesn't cost a ton and I will still have to search. I agree with another reviewer who found it to smell too much like sunscreen and that it makes your face greasy/shiny. I don't know if it has made me break out or not but my skin's been more congested since I've been using it more so now I'm just using it on neck and chest to use it up while I search for something better.
"Have used this product for years, and like the other frustrated customers, I am unhappy about the change. The new formula does not smell good, it stings the skin slightly. A tiny bit of it got on my lips and now my mouth tastes like sunblock. Yuck. Never experienced this with the old stuff. Just tried to call customer service but was told there would be a very long wait."
"Like many others, I have used this product for many years and was very very happy with it. I just purchased what I thought was the same product (packing is the same but later noticed it now says broad spectrum) and it has a terrible smell, like teenage acne cream, and stings when you apply it. The new ingredient seems to be something called Avobenzone. Please revert to the old formula which was great."
"I am 30 years old and have used this product since I was in high school. A week ago I bought a new bottle and immediately noticed a new fragrant smell and when I put the moisturizer on my face I had a burning sensation and my face turned bright red. Thinking it might have been a bad bottle I went out and bought a second bottle, same results though. I loved this product and swore by it before the formula changed. I hope the old formula comes back, until then I will have to find a new moisturizer."
I had used Intensified Day Moisture for many years and was very disappointed you discontinued it. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!! I tried this as an option and it is ok. I have sensitive skin and break out. This one was not as light and nice as the Intensified Day Moisture. It almost felt greasy even though it is oil free. It didn't break me out but I am going to try something else. Didn't like odor at all.
"I use this every morning and night as my moisturizer. After a while, it started to hydrate my face and it didn't look as dry anymore. The only downside of this product is that it leaves my skin VERY shiny.It doesn't absorb quickly into my skin like the description says."
I had to stop wearing sunscreen because it burnt my eyes and left a white cast but I knew I needed it because I use retinol and alpha hydroxy at night so I tried this in the morning over my vitamin c serum and cream and it did not burn or sting and absorbed completely with no white cast I will use this brand from now on love it
I thought I had bought the wrong product as soon as I put some on my hand. I have severe allergies and this stuff stinks! More like insecticide than a product for your face. It is listed as UNSCENTED. That is definitely not true anymore. I have used this for years but no more. Not sure why you changed it but new is bad.
"I had no problems with the prior bottle of this product. After use, I broke out in a hive-like rash all over my face which has taken days to heal. I should have read the fine print which states ""stop use and ask a doctor if rash occurs"". Too, I looked up the ingredients and have found that while oxybenzone is indeed a sunscreen agent, oxybenzone can cause an allergenic reaction and affect the immune system."
"I bought this moisturizer only because it promised to be a grease-free sun protection. And, while it is not oily, there is no statement anywhere on the packaging or Neutrogena website that it actully protects fron UVA. SPF only guarantees UVB protection (sunburn), yet the UVA protection (main cause of skin cancer) is a question mark. I fell light burning sensation every time I use this moisturizer. I wonder if one of irritant ingredients is really harsh."
"I'm honestly not wild about how this performs, it seems to kind of put a thin barrier on your skin rather than really hydrating the skin, however, it's the only spf moisturizer i've tried that doesn't irritate my skin or cause it to break it out, so for that reason i absolutely love it. and it's great value for money, a bottle lasts for ages"
"This face lotion has so many great qualities. It's light and absorbs easily, yet it still provides the moisture I need. It doesn't make my super-sensitive skin break out or itch. It's been a standby of mine for years. I love that it has SPF 15 as I wear it daily under makeup, and I don't need an extra product to protect my skin from sun-exposure. It's great for my neck as well. It doesn't have a strong scent either. A big bonus."
My 11 year old has acne and her dermatologist recommended this as a moisturizer in her routine. It is great. It has provided moisture without causing a greasy or shiny appearance. It is not heavy and you only need a very small amount to cover your face. Although it is only a 4 ounce bottle it has lasted a long time. We love this product and recommend it to others.
"I bought this moisturizer a few days ago and am in love with it! i use it twice every day. after just two days my face feels so soft and smooth! i love that it's also oil-free and contains spf 15. unlike other moisturizers i've tried, this one doesn't make my face feel oily or look shiny. to sum up, it's a very powerful, but lightweight moisturizer."
"I want to have great skin, but I'm a broke college student and I am very unwilling to spend big money on a moisturizer. I used to use Olay products, but I found that they made my skin feel oily and I could not wear them under makeup. In comparison, I can't even tell I'm wearing this moisturizer! I'm sure I could find better moisturizers that feel lighter at higher prices, but this works just fine."
"I wouldn't recommend following the instructions on the back of the package. I have normal skin, and using a whole pump full of this stuff is way too much for me. I also wear glasses, and if I do follow the instructions, my glasses slip and slide everywhere. Also, my nose and my forehead look really greasy after using this product. Now, I just use a little less than half a pump of this stuff and it still moisturizes and works fine. Plus, the product will last longer too!"
I bought this product to try something new and have been using it for about 4 months. When you first rub the product on your face it will make you appear very shiny and oily. After about 10 minutes it will be unnoticeable. It has really helped my skin become softer and I love the built in SPF. Definitely a great product!
"I have tried a lot of different moisturizers and they all made my skin feel oily, greasy and made me break out more. I tried this one because it was oil free and spf and I LOVE IT!!!! It doesn't cause me to break out it leaves my skin feeling soft. I don't get shiny with it at all. Its the best moisturizer I've tried."
"I have been using this for about two years now, and I don't think I'll ever stop. I like that it has SPF, and doesn't have a tacky feel like other SPF moisturizers I've tried. Over the past two years I have tried other moisturizers, including expensive ones, and this is still the best for me. I have very oily skin, so the oil free aspect of this really helps. I highly recommend this product."
"I have tried other three step procedures with other (more expensive)products, and this is the first moisturizer with a UVA/UVB SPF that doesn't leave my skin greasy. When I use this following the Alcohol-Free toner and the Deep Clean cleanser my face is oil free all day. It's light, the pump provides the perfect amount and it is oder free. Excellent day cream for a great price!"
I accidentally purchased the SPF 15 sunscreen moisturizer instead of my usual Sensitive Skin moisturizer. This product makes my skin sting very badly. I tried the product in the same bottle a couple times - just to make sure the stinging wasn't a one-time result. I use regular sunscreen and have never had a reaction like this. I cannot recommend this product. It should be pulled from store shelves.
The product is genuine and of the same standard. It is reasonably priced and the amazing fact is the shipping is free!!!!!!
"I've been buying this moisturizer for years and love it, but something's not right with my latest purchase. It smells really bad, like chemicals. Has anyone else noticed this? I'm afraid to use it."
"Love this product! I have sensitive skin and have no problems with redness or sensitivity. It is light, non-greasy and can be worn alone or with makeup and does an excellent job of protecting my skin from sunburn."
"I've used this product for 16 years. I just purchased a new bottle and immediately noticed the smell. Not good. Also, it burned when I put it my face. I only used it for a few days but will not buy it again."
"I have been using this product for over a year and love it. I wear it under foundation, for a bit extra moisture and sun protection, but it's light and clean and doesn't cause any breakouts (which I still can get at fifty-something)."
I've used this cream for years and I loved it but recently the formula has changed along with the packaging. It now leaves my skin feeling oily and it burns a little. Why did you change a perfect product?!?!
Very disappointed with product changes. New formula smells and irritates skin. Looking for a replacement after many years of swearing by this product - very disappointed.
I bought this moisturizer yesterday. I used it last night this morning and tonight and I can already tell how clear and soft my skin is. It smells wonderful too! I will definitely be buying this again!
I have used this product for many years because I have sensitive skin but now when I use this product my skin has a burning sensation. Is this a new formula? I will need to find an another product to use.
"I don't like the new scent...it smells like fake watermelon. It's funny because it says that it's fragrance free but it's not anymore. And yes, it stings my skin too. Why did you have to change something that was working so well before?"
"Have used other moisturizers, but I can definitely see the difference. It's not too greasy, or to thick. Thanks Neutrogena for making a great moisturizer."
"I have used this product for years and have until the last few months or so, loved it!! Not sure what you have done to it.... Eyelids burning, swollen, awful!!!"
"Seriously, I've been using this product for 10+ years and loved it, even better than expensive brands. Just bought a new bottle and my skin is stinging....why change the formula?!"
"I always used the tinted oil free.....what happened to it? Neutrogena is the only product i can use on my face without breaking out,. Always used the tinted but I guess they have stopped making it....very disappointed."
"After using this moisturizer daily for many years, I find that the new scent (of watermelon) is off-putting. I also seem to experience itching on my eyelids. I am now looking for another brand."
"While I love this cream, it does bother me that I can't find any information on whether or not the protection is for both UVA and UVB. Living in New Zealand, that is an important criterion for me. Could you please clarify Neutrogena?"
"I was nervous the first time I put the moisturizer on. With the SPF I thought it was going to be greasy and smelly, but as soon as it hit my face the SPF smell went away and my face was grease free and oh so smooth!"
"I've been using this for about nine months. I like it. Don't love it. Says oil-free, non-greasy, but it makes my skin kinda slick. If you can afford to buy something better, I would."
I AM 43 AND HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT DAILY FOR YEARS AND I HAVE PEOPLE ALWAYS TELLING ME I LOOK YOUNGER THAN I AM. I SWEAR BY IT. IT ALSO COMPLIMENTS ANY MAKEUP REGIMEN I CHOOSE AND NEVER LEAVES ME GREASY. I WILL USE THIS PRODUCT FOREVER.
I use this moisturizer every day and have for 30 years. I love that it has sunscreen in it also. It is light...never feels heavy on my face. It is awesome. I highly recommend it.
Works ok for combination skin. However this formula irritates my skin? I find it odd considering the other formula without the suncreen didn't have that effect. But this one burns and leaves my face red for a while after application. Will be looking for another product.
"I love Neutrogena products and have used them for years. I purchased the Oil-Free Daily Moisturizer specifically for the SPF. I usually buy the same product without the SPF, but after being diagnosed with Melanoma, I thought it a wise switch. The moisturizer with the SPF has a slightly funny smell, somewhat less pleasant than your typical sunscreen. It does fade away, but when you first apply it to your face, it is not very pleasant."
"It burns! I started using this moisturizer during high school. I got compliments about my skin being smooth and bright. I don't know if my skin have become sensitive or they changed the formula. I'm using this for my hands now, because it burns my face, but not my hands."
I love this product. A little goes a very long way! One bottle lasts me several months!
Love this product just as good as the high priced Este Lauder lotion
"Sadly, this product makes my eyes burn and tear. I try to avoid getting it close to my eyes but.. My face also feels a burning sensation right after I put it on. I purchased another Nutrogena product and it does the very same. Even my co-workers comment on my eyes tearing. I won't be able to purchase again."
"I have trusted this moisturizer for years, but the new formula made my skin burn horribly, so much that people asked me if I got sunburned at the beach even 2 days after using it. I loved the old formula, but the new one is absolutely horrible. Also has a strong cucumbery scent which I do not prefer over the old unscented version. I am so sad that I have to look for a new moisturizer that works."
"This was the first moisturizer I ever tried, and I was horrified with the results! My skin broke out immediately and it felt greasy and heavy on my face. I tried it once and had at least 2 break outs, but when summer hit and I wanted to try it again (it has sun protection) I regretted it, as the same thing happened again. Maybe this would work better for dry skin... like very dry skin. If you don't have dry skin, I wouldn't recommend this moisturizer."
"I have extreme oily skin , with large pores but super sensitive to breakouts . so it was a real gamble trying something new. I started using this In October 2016 and its been amazing . My skin has not reacted negatively , its gentle to use but i still get the right moisture , no clogging . Great to wear under makeup . ( I've seen reviews about tanning but I'm Dark-skinned so hard to say but so far haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary ) I will definitely recommend this product"
"So I've been using this product for several years now. My dermatologist recommended that I get a higher SPF moisturizer so I tried RoC Multi Correxion 5-in-1 Daily Moisturizer because it has SPF 30. Boy, did I make a mistake from switching! Not only does the Oil-Free Moisture feel light on the skin, it is well worth the price! I won't make the same mistake again, Neutrogena products never disappoint!"
"Even though it says it is oil free, it leaves my face really oily. It also causes me to break out and I've never had acne problems. It also causes my face to burn. Whenever I stop using it, my face returns to normal. When I start to use it again, I start breaking out everywhere. Not going to keep using this."
"Thank you Neutrogena! Please don't ever change this formula. My extremely sensitive skin cannot take oil or fragrance, which are extremely irritating to the skin So thankful to see your oil and fragrance free line of products and broad spectrum sun protection. As always with neutrogena you get great quality in the ingredients."
when i bought this product i put in on right when i got home to test it out and it smelled like sunscreen...after like a few minutes i asked my mom if i smelled like sunscreen and she said no this product is really great i truley love its one of my favorite things one thing id change is not to have a sunscreen smell at first. if you want a spf lotion for your face id get this one
I bought this about two months ago and I love it. With the spf it does smell slightly of sunscreen but it doesn't make me oily witch is great
I bought this to put under makeup for additional SPF. This product burns my face and especially in the eyelid area. I am throwing it away.
"I bought this product because it is fragrance free and contains sunscreen. After using product just once my skin, both cheeks, are red and burning."
I've been using this for over a year now every day. I have never broken out from it and it goes on well.
Wife thoroughly enjoyed product out here in the New Mexico high desert where it is very dry and one experiences greater UV due to altitude
Pros: It really is oil free! Great sunscreen coverage. Works great for daily use under foundation. Will use the bottle up.
I've been using this product for 5 years now and it has been nothing but helpful. I 100% recommend it.
Love this for my face. I have tried others and always come back to this item.
"I got this a month ago as I was looking for a new moisturiser with spf, but this hurts my face! Doesn't make my skin feel soft, is thin and really irritates my skin."
"I use this as my day moisturizer and love it! I never thought I would find a sunscreen/moisturizer that doesn't irritate my skin, cause breakouts and make me look oily!"
I love this product! Some SPF product clog my pore but not this one. It is very light and goes on evenly. I also love the pump because it insures that I don't use to much product.
"I always liked this moisturizer, but unfortunately I do not find more in Brazil. Thera are very little products that we have here and the size are very small, some only found here and they don't have the same quality."
"This product doesn't bother my sensitive skin. It is fragrance free but does not smell bad. The smell reminds me of sunscreen, but it is very simple. I love using this product everyday."
"I have oily skin in my ""T"" zone but my cheeks always get dry. This moisterizer works perfectly without being greasy and offers all day protection from the sun. I use this daily after using my Neutrogena face wash and astringent...highly recommended!"
I really love this moisturizer! It's lightweight and makes my face feel really soft. My skin is super sensitive and has a tendency to break out with moisturizers but this didn't break my face out!
"Would really recommend this product. It's light, non-sticky, and absorbs really well. The pump dispenses the right amount, and it also lasts a good while too."
After I wash my face my skin is dry but throughout the day my face becomes oily so I thought this would help. Ohh was I wrong. It caused my face to break out. I've never had acne and now I do. I can't even wear makeup because I'm scared it's going to make it worse. I'm so upset.
"Regret getting this moisturiser. It's so runny and it just makes my face even oilier. I thought that this moisturiser wouldn't make my face goes red because i have rather sensitive skin and it also claims that it is hypoallergenic. But every single time when I apply it on my face, my face instantly turns red and hot. Definitely won't repurchase this product."
"The product leaves a greasy look on my face(not as noticeable as regular sunscreen) but enough for my skin to look like I am sweating. I believe this product does not work for those girls with dry skin and an oily t-zone. The product has worked for two of my friends, but they are very fair in complexion and already have nice skin to begin with. This product does not work well by itself when it comes to combatting against the sun for me; If your skin gets tanned fast I suggest an extra sunscreen on top of your face"
"Well, I have been using Proactiv for some time and my skin was finally starting to clear when one day I spent a ton of time outside and that night when i was washing my face, my skin started to feel like it was burning! The next day I was at Walgreens and I saw this! It looked perfect for me because it wasn't pore clogging and it gave me sun protection. Now I've been using it for about a month and I love it!! It makes my skin glow!"
"I know it states its hypoallergenic but I had an allergic reaction to this moisturizer. My skin broke out in a rash. I do have sensitive skin, so I thought that this would be sensitive enough for me but it most certainly was not. Also like other posts I too had oily skin after use."
"I have oily skin. I have purchased the Neutrogena moisturizer for combination skin and it worked great. Since I don't have combination skin, I assumed the moisturizer intended for oily skin would be more ideal for my skin however I was wrong. I realized a trend of skin break outs (I have really clean skin and I rarely get acne) and i am more oily than ever while using this product. I love Neutrogena's other products, this one is just not one of them."
Great product. I've been using this for years. But it is currently 118mL which is over the international airplane carry on limit of 100mL and I've probably had to give up a dozen of these to TSA over the years. Please reduce the size (and cost) just a tad!
"I have super sensitive skin. I had flakiness in all the wrong spots like my T-Zone and the creases in my nose and chin. This product reversed my flakiness, it absorbs very quickly! When u first apply the product it does feel slimy but it immediately absorbs into a soft, non-greasy moisturizer."
"I really wanted this to help my skin, but I've been using this for almost 2 months and its just OK. I use only half a pump because thats all you really need, and it has protected me from the sun so far this summer (I do reapply another sunscreen on top of this if I'm at the beach). It does smell like sunscreen and its a bit heavy, but after a couple of minutes it absorbs. I've had a few breakouts but thats nothing new, so it hasn't made my skin worse, or better."
"I've been using this moisturizer for less than a week with the deep clean long-last daily scrub and it works great! Im really excited about this moisturizer because its non-comedogenic, and fragrance-free which doesnt irritate my skin. Im in love with this product already. I strongly recommend it to people with kind of dry/normal skin."
"I always tried to find a moisturizer that would keep my skin soft and that wouldn't clog my pores. My skin is a bit sensitive so it always feels dry after I wash it. Most moisturizers I bought wouldn't keep my skin soft or were too heavy! Neutrogena's mosturizer is the best by far! i started using it a month ago, during the winter season and my skin look great and feels so soft! I LOVE IT"
"This is the best facial moisturizer I've ever, EVER used. It doesn't leave my face feeling greasy after application or dry once evening rolls around. I love that it has SPF 15 too and I use it year-round to help protect my skin. The bottle usually lasts me a couple of months so it's well worth the price! I'd recommend it to anyone!"
Nice product. Makes skin soft and feel nice. Also smells nice.
Why change a good thing!?!? Not a fan of the new formula...
Light not greasy or sticky. Nice light fragrance. Good sunscreen too.
I have been using this product for 5 years and I just love it.
I like the light texture & fragrance
On the first and second days It left my skin feeling smooth clean and soft! On the third day it took away almost all my acne problems! Love it <3
It's oily and makes your face really shiny. I'm getting more pimples because of it. Might have to look for another moisturizer
"this product is supposed to be oil be oil free, but it leave my face feeling greasy. i think it's even causing me to break out which i rarely do."
I love this product! It protects my skin from getting sun burned and it keeps my face from being oliy. I love it!!!!!!!
"This product does what it says at a reasonable price. It is not a ""wow"" experience, but it keeps my skin moist and protected."
This product made my face greasy even though it is supposed to be oil free. It felt like a greasy film on my face. I had to wash this stuff off immediately. Don't buy this product. You will be throwing your money away. Buy something else instead.
"This product is amazing, I would recomend it to all of my friends. I actually have it on right now. I love it, it makes my face moisurized and i know that it is protected from any sun."
"I found my new face moisturizer. The aroma smells like the beach, so fresh and light. Within seconds, my face feels so soft and smooth. I will keep using this product daily because it's oil free. I live in Florida so the SPF is very important."
I used this for almost a year and it's lightweight and gives me the perfect amount of moisture without feeling greasy or oily. My cheeks are mostly dry while my t-zone gets oily and this moisturizer works great for my skin!
"I have used this moisturizer for years and love it. I have oily/comination skin and live in a hot, humid climate. This product protects my skin with a good SPF but doesn't clog my pores or cause breakouts. A wonderful, affordable product!!"
"It's the only facial moisturizer I've used so far that does not make me break out. Only a small quantity needs to be applied, so it lasts quite long. Works great when used with the original formula Facial Cleansing Bar. Awesome product!"
"I use this every day. It's not greasy, has sun block, and feels great after shaving too. Excellent product to moisturize and protect without clogging pores or feeling greasy."
"I used this after the wave Sonic, and my skin felt fantastic! my skin actuall had a glow to it. Which is important since I have such tan skin that can be oily. I found that adding a moisturizer actually reduced the oil amount in my face."
I use Proactiv 2x everyday and this is the perfect finish! I use it on my face and neck after step 3 and it helps keep my skin hydrated all day & protected. Thank you for making it :D
I find Oil-Free Moisture SPF-15 does a great job of hydrating my face without leaving it feeling greasy or slick. I plan to continue using this product regularly as a part of my daily cleansing routine
"This product is amazing... I have oily skin and I've tried most of the products that I was recommended to use, but this moisturiser is the one that works for me. it slightly makes my face shinny which isn't a bad thing I guess. also I did not breakout when using this product, which is a huge thumbs up."
"First time using this product and will be the last. I bought this product because I have super oily skin and I wanted a moisturizer that didn't contain a lot of oil. But when I started using this moisturizer after a few days I notice my skin extremely irritated and extremely dry. I have never had sensitive skin, but this product made my skin completely dried, red, and cracked. Never buying this product."
"What I don't understand about this product is that it says oil free but when I put it on my face my face looks extremely oily. Yes it does moisturizes your face but to the point where you look like you just cooked some bacon and it also clogs your pores. I have used basically the same moisturizer before by the same company and also had spf15 but it was in a jar container, that stuff did work but maybe they changed the formula when they changed the container. Anyway this stuff is horrible and will never buy it again."
"I love how quickly this sinks into my face, and it feels so nice. It doesn't have a weird smell, and it lasts FOREVER. The only downside for me is that it is only spf 15. I have tried the spf 35 and it feels and smells completely different to this one. Obnoxious. I have been using this for 3 years though and I will continue."
I have combo skin and this really makes my whole face feel kind of oily and greasy :/ The spf is good but it really does take a long time to sink into your skin. I think for combo/oily skin this can make you look greasy but my mom with dry skin swears by this! She buys this in bulk lol. Just not for me.
"I have tried several products for my face that promises to deliver, finally I found one that did just that! I have also purchased the facial bar cleanser, the pore refining toner and the night time rapid wrinkle repair! Great stuff. Neutrogena keep up the good work! :)"
"I have been using this sunscreen for 2 weeks, and it started to burn. Not goood :("
Used this lotion for over 25 years. Great day moisturizer.
"Love the smell of the lotion. It goes on light, makes my sick feel soft, and doesn't feel greasy."
I've been using Neutragena for over 40 years always exceptional value!!!
This is my favoriate product. It cleanses and softens without drying. I have a healthy glow. Thanks Neutrogena
I like how it moisturizes my skin but the odor burns my eyes. There's another cheaper brand that uses the same ingredients which does not burn my eyes but it makes me look oily. I thought this would be better.
i have used this for over three years & have combination skin with acne scars and a few pimples arise every once in a while. its a good moisturizer but thats it. nothing more special...
"They changed the formula. It now has fragrance and it burns my face when I put it on. I will need to find a new moisturizer. The new one has ""Broad Spectrum"" above the SPF."
This moisturizer is great for sunny weather with UV rays. The bad thing is it smells just like sunscreen so if you wear it when it's cold you will smell like sunscreen. It doesn't leave your skin dry or tight.
"This product defiantly helps you have dry and oily skin. It keeps most of the oil controlled and the dry patches disappear! Overall, an almost everyday product for me. Thanks Neutrogena!"
it's okay I wish it was a little thicker and worked faster. I was using proactive and it really dried out my skin so I used this and u don't get fast results at all. Bottom line not that impressive.
"It makes feels greasy when I apply it and it appears greasy but the look does eventually wear off (although I can't tell you how long it takes). From what I can tell, it had not broken my skin out yet."
i use this item every night with first toner and night cream and then moisturrizer. also i use every morning just toner and this. my skin feels smoother than before.
"I have combination skin and this is fabulous. Right after I got it, I tested it out. My skin immediately felt softer. Yes, it does smell slightly like sunscreen like people said but it's not overwhelming. I will definitely purchase this again."
"Neutrogena finally reformulated the active sunscreens in this, to include Avobenzone, so it now provides both UVA and UVB protection, which it did not before. Some people might not be happy with the formula change, but there is no point in using an SPF product that does not provide both UVA/UVB protection. This also smells so good, like watermelon! I find it sinks in/absorbs quickly, but will leave behind that sunscreen sheen, that all SPF's seem to. I will re-buy!"
"My daughter has been using this product for about a year. About 3 months ago, her face began to itch and turn red. It slowly spread all over her face and got so bad her eyes were irritated and puffy. Her doctor asked her to stop using all products. We thought it was make-up she was using. After 2 weeks of using nothing, her face returned to normal. However, she used it once yesterday (and wore no make-up) and woke up with her face all red and puffy again! The company needs to look at the ingredients again!!!"
"I have been using this product for more than 20 years. I love it. This moisturizer provides me with a nice smooth, non sticky, non tacky moisturizer. It also provides me with SPF coverage. Plus it's fragrance free or if there is a smell it's minimal. I have very sensitive skin & this product doesn't make my skin breakout."
It was a pleasure to know it works good helped with the blackheads.
"This product is not greasy, feels good on the skin, has medium SPF protection and softens skin."
I like the fact that my daily moisturizer has sunscreen.
"Finally, an SPF containing moisturizer that's not greasy and doesn't smell like a summer vacation. It's my perfect solution."
It tanned my skin. It also made it itch I used to use the sensitive moisturizer. I will be switching back.
"I turned 64 last week but I look the reverse (46), I believe it's due to good genes and Neutrogena skin care!!!"
"i love this stuff.. perfect for my skin.. & and just a dab does the trick.. not oily, just pure moisture."
After applying this moisturizer i felt a burning sensation in my face; the next i had two blisters in my right cheek.
"My cheeks are usually rough and blotchy, but this moisturizer is really moistening and softening my skin!"
i have combination skin. when i used this my skin became very oily and shiny! I got lots and lots of pimples on my face. The smell is not that bad as mentioned by some.
Love the non-greasy feel of this moisturizing sunscreen
It is working as well as any moisturizer I have used at a good price
I have been using this moisturizer for many years. I love it.
A little goes a long way. It goes on without being greasy. Love it!
I have used this product for my face for about 20 years. Love it!
"This product might be good, but it smells like medicine. Also, my skin became red when I put it for the first time. Will return it."
Its my first time use this product. I love it!!!! Left my face fresh and so soft and smooth. It's a keeper.... :)
