It does the job every bit as well as the creams that cost 3-4 times as much - even the same brand! It is the optimum mix of moisturizing and gentle to the skin. I believe that this is the original facial cream that helped Oil of Olay build their reputation and brand. And it remains every bit as good.
"I absolutely love everything about this moisturizer. A little goes a long way and it smells amazing! I use it on my face, neck, and hands."
Have looked for this particular product for a long time and finally found it on your site (not in the store). Hope you continue to carry it.
"Affordable nice moisturizer! If I get dry patches on my face, I use this to target them and they're gone in a day or two. I can't use this all over my face or too long because it will break me out. Absorbs quickly and is not greasy. I have purchased this a few times! #contest"
i love how smooth and creamy this is i can tell the difference
"I have used this product for over 20 years I think. Can't find it in stores anymore, but soooo glad to have found it at Walmart online. Still cheap for anything by Olay."
Nice weight for day cream
"I love the freshness of this cream. It's so light and airy, and feels so good on my face. It's just the right moisture but not greasy. I use it prior to putting on my mineral foundation. It's perfect! Thank you Olay!"
"My skin is extremely dry and this is the best moisturizer that I've ever found, even better than the super expensive brands. The low price is just a bonus!"
"I put this on after I cleanse and exfoliate my face every morning. Then i do my make up this makes my face look smooth and flawless. I love how it isnt heavy and I cant even feel it on my skin, Makes my face so soft. I also use this as a night cream and wake up to my skin feeling fresh and smooth. This is defiantly a must have for me."
"Ran out of my department store brand moisturizer & couldn't afford to get a replacement. Heard that this product was pretty good, so I figured I would give it a shot. Looked around online and this was the lowest price AND it was free shipping to my home. Couldn't pass that up. Used once so far and it's really good stuff!"
"this product is better than any expensive face & neck lotion I have ever used. It leaves my skin so soft & I'm already noticing a difference in the overall appearance of my skin...love this, wish I would have tried it before spending all that money....great product at a fair price!"
"I grew up in Arizona and in my teens I became aware of how the dry air was affecting my skin. I couldn't use the same products as my peers because they seemed to have have heavy perfumes and chemicals that made my skin burn and break out . Oil of Olay became my favorite moisturizer because it soaked right into my skin without irritation. My face felt smooth, soft and quenched. Today many people tell me I look much younger than I am. I credit the Oil of Olay product line for that."
"As I have aged my skin got allergic re-actions to many creams. I had used olay products in my youth and gave it another try. Olay active hydrating cream,original is the only one that works. I am so happy I tried it again after so many years. My skin has cleared up and is looking good once again."
Feels good on my skin however I do not care for the scent. I should have ordered the sensitive skin type which is probably unscented. Other than that I like it.
"I've been using Olay for 42 years, I've tried many moisturizers that are far more expensive, I always come back to the Olay that started it all. My children know the scent and love it."
this stuff is awsome i had super dry skin no more after this stuff make up goes on so smooth and i have a heathy glow now no more flakes!:) fantastic dont like the new packageing verymuch but the product is excelent!
"I HAVE TRIED ONE OF THE OTHER CREAMS,AND WAS SATISFIELD, I HOPE THIS ONE IS JUST AS GOOD, SO FAR AFTER DAILY USE,IT HELPS IN KEEPING MY FACE MOIST,AND SOFT,I WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE OTHER CLAIMS, SO FAR WITH OLAYS PRODUCTS I WILL KEEP USING THEM,"
"This face cream is horrible! I have used it for about 2 days and noticed dry spots on my face. It does make your face feel smooth but it is not so ""hydrating"" at all! Do not recommend"
I was not impressed. I will finish the rest but it has a nasty scent.
I have very dry skin and this is perfect and smells great.
use it frequently and love Olay
Slight scent is pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
it feels silky on my face & moisturizes quite well
I am highly disappointed that you have discontinued the sensitive skin face cream. (Blue graphics on jar) It is the only hydrating cream that I have found on the market that is a comfortable excellent facial cream for me. It did not make me red or itchy and did not burn. The pink cream is not near as good. I do not understand why you dropped the other. Now I am back to the way I was before :( Please bring it back. I would even pay more for it.
I love it
This is a great moisturizer. It's not greasy and sinks right into skin but still hydrates well. This is a repurchase.
"I bought this item according to reviews. One reviewer stated that it was too greasy. Great! I needed a moisturizer that I can feel actually moisturizes. This one does not, actually feels dryung on the skin. Returning!"
olay moisturizing cream
Works well for face
Ok so I am very picky about the type of face lotion I use cause I have oily skin but it's dry at the same time. I absolutely love this face cream and I have been using for the last 6 years everyday. I love the smell and the price but I have notice a change in this product! It isn't as thick and creamy as it used to be and it isnt moisturizing my face like it used to. They either changed the ingredients or maybe watered it down but it has definitely changed and I am not happy about it! :(
"My Grandmother used Oil of Olay. Since I was a a young teenager I would use hers. I personally love the sent, maybe sentimental now as it will forever remind me of her. But I have always loved the scent. There are so very many new products on the market, but this is tried and true. I can't even be bothered with other moisturizers, Oil of Olay is my one and only and a family tradition so to say. With five of her children and 15 grandchildren who have children of there own 90% of us use it!"
"This is truly the best facial cream out there to use. I have tried many only to go back to Olay Active Hydrating cream. I just hope and pray that the company does not discontinue this wonderful product. I started using Olay active hydrating cream when I was 25 and I have no wrinkles and people want to know what's my secret and of course I proudly say ""Olay Baby""!"
"My mom will be 90 years old in June 2011. She has used Olay ever since I was a little girl and I am now 52. She is so beautiful for her age and always has Oil of Olay in her bathroom and bedroom. I have been using for about 23 years now and everyone tells me I look like I am in my late 30's or early 40's. I tell them ""Oil of Olay"". It makes me think of her every morning and night when I use it getting ready for work or getting ready for bed. LOVE IT! Thank you so much for wrinkle free face and a memory of a life time."
Works to soften quickly. Noticed a difference right away.
"Newer versions of this product bother my skin. This one, original formula, is great."
"I have been using this for years. A simple, excellent moisturizer that doesn't clog your pores. It can even be helpful with removing makeup that is hard to get off. And love the smell!"
I was in search of a new face lotion and tried this. I AM IN LOVE! My skin this past winter has been so dry but I have oily sections and couldn't get the balance right. It makes my skin so soft and has been able to help me keep the dryness away. I loved it so much I started using it on a keloid scar on my chest that I have has for 15 years. It is softening the scar and helping the scar to flatten. I have tried so many products to help this scar heal and this has worked the best!!!
"This moisturizer is a godsend. I struggled with severely dry skin for months this winter and tried so many different moisturizers and treatments, even oils, but nothing helped. My grandmother always recommended Olay brand so I decided to give this a try, and I'm soooo glad i did! In under a week my skin was completely flake free and after using it every day, twice a day for a few weeks my skin is softer than it's ever been. This is now a holy grail product for me. I'll never try anything else!"
"I wish I'd found this sooner than my 61 yrs. But all I can say is wowzers!!! I remember the smell from my childhood and it is amazing. I have only used the day n night creams for about a week.but I can already see the changes in my skin. I am impressed. At first feel on skin,I thought it was matty.but it dries to silk.my face is so soft!! This is from an estee lauder girl too...I will not go back.i live this old classic!!!"
I grew up with my mom always using Olay original so of course that's what I use. It leaves your face so soft and keeps it nice and moisturized. The smell always brings back happy memories of my mom. This is a great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used Olay's face moisturizer for probably close to 40 years and absolutely love it to this day. It leaves my face feeling so clean and fresh feeling. So soft and supple. And I credit those 40 years with hardly any wrinkles. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Olay recommends this cream as a replacement to its discontinued dew over moisturiser. Dew over used to be a gel based that moisturised and made face GLOW. Same with tone correcting night cream replaced with firming cream? They don't give same result. Please stop producing extra product lines and keep consistency in your old products. Very disappointed and will loose your long time customer like me.
"I used to use the Active Hydrating cream for sensitive skin which did not contain fragrance and it was the best moisturizer ever. But for some strange reason, Olay stopped making it. So I tried this, the Active Hydrating original formula. It moisturizes well, but I can't get past all the fragrance. WAY too much perfume! I won't be buying it again."
"This moisturizer made my skin a lot softer! I love this lotion but Olay please make the packaging bigger! I use up this product really fast and it's really bad for the environment to keep throwing away these hard plastic containers! The small size is good for travel, but not for home."
"I recently move to California where the air is much drier than the humid south, where I'm from.I needed to switch moisturizers because my face was so dry that it began breaking out (I normally have no acne.) Since I've been using this, my face is back to normal and maybe even a little softer! No more dry patches for me!!"
"I have purchased many moisturizers, and this is by far the BEST.....This year I will hit 40, and must admit, I started the hunt several years ago. Not many products have I purchased more than once, but this is one that I always have. IMO, it must be used with whatever wrinkle/acne/problem, you may have, but, is the most, perfect moisturizer to use layered with whatever you may be using for your own personal needs. Love this stuff, don't ever discontinue this Olay...Please!"
"And ""old school"" is great...:) There is a reason why this product is still on the market, after all. I remember my mom using this sporadically, and I have tried other Olay products, but this is the one I was remain faithful to. My regimen is Oil of Olay in the morning; and Night of Olay prior to bed. My skin is radiant, soft, younger looking and more firm in literally just a matter of days. I don't care about looking ""older"", but I want to look the best I can at every age. Oil of Olay is helping me do just that. Thanks so much!"
I Love this cream! Its not heavy at all. everything will absorb in three minutes. I have oily and dry skin and couldn't wear anything at night without a zit in the morning! Im serious. Its great all day long. I recommended to my mom who doesnt ever use anything but soap. made a difference to her seemingly perfect skin. and it last long and a cheap price. FYI: I am a real person! I always think the makers post their own comments to get people to buy it.
Love it. Keeps my face hydrating. Will buy again and again
A little too greasy for my face and I broke out. seems to work okay on my neck though. so I'll keep it for that. but I won't buy it again.
"I have been using =Olay Moisture cream for more years then I can count, it's perfect for hot weather nice & light, non greasy, & Walmart has the best price !!!!"
I have been using the Olay Active Hydrating Cream Original for over 20 years. It still moisturizes just as well as it did decades ago. A quality product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been useing oil of Olay since I was !6 years old, would not think of using any other moisturizer ever. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm closing in on 50 years and if it wasn't for this product I'm sure I would look closer to 60. Keeps my skin hydrated, supple and most importantly wrinkles at bay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
There is no other face lotion that compares to the simple moisturizing of this classic lotion. Love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can't find my main stay product of 13 years, sensitive with sunscreen, in the 4 ounce jar. The new pour bottle is thinner an not the same product. I want my product back, please!!!"
"I highly recommend this product if you have very dry skin. I can only use ""creams"" as lotions and gels do not hydrate me as well. This product is wonderful! The only downside is there is no spf in it."
"Sometimes my sensitive skin can get really dry, especially in the winter so I use this for my face day and night and it makes my skin so soft and smooth. I LOVE it!"
"I started using this product when I was young b/c whenever I met someone older who didn't look it I would ask what they used and they always said, Oil of Olay. Its a classic for a reason!"
"Love this product! I have been using this product for over 20 years and still get outstanding results. It's an excellent moisturizer, without being greasy."
"I've always been in the mindset that you get what you pay for, however this cream seems to be an exception. I admit it doesn't have those anti-aging chemicals in it which cost more, but it does do what it says - keep my skin soft. I use it every morning right out of the shower (while my face is still damp) and the affects seem to last all day."
"Great price, decent moisture. Use it every morning before putting my sun screen."
I have been using this for year and I am in love with it! It's the perfect light weight face cream and the price is great! A little goes a long way!
My wife has been using this product for years and will continue to do so. She settled on this particular item after having tried several other brands.
Works well but there is definitely too much perfume in this product.
For an inexpensive moisturizer I would recommend this one. It is light but hydrating.
"makes skin feel nice, but reluctant to use because of chemical smell"
Only need to apply a small amount each night. Absorbs quickly and has a refreshing scent
"Very helpful for my dry hand. I use it at night, the second day, my hand is not dry anymore."
Worth the money!
I love this product. It moisturizes but without leaving a thick film that you can feel. Great before applying makeup or for when you feel dry.
Makes my face super soft! Love it!
My mom loves olay
