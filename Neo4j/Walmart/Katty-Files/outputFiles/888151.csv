I have very special skin which needs a very special moisturizer. Sensitive skin that spots up with exposure to the sun. This keeps the spots away. I am going to order as many as I can so I don't run out. A girls got to keep looking her best at any age.
I love this product. I have dry skin and can't use just any moisturizer Most make me breakout Oil of Olay is perfect. Very light but effective. I also have a lot of people tell me how much younger I look. Like I am my skin is aging at a slower pace.
"Previously, I was only able to use Mary Kay facial products for my skin due to my skin being sensitive. However, I took a chance on this moisturizer and I love it. I've had no allergic reactions to it and it keeps my face feeling moisturized all day. This will now be my go to moisturizer."
Love this product. It is smooth and creamy. A little greasy but if I'm home I just leave it alone but if I am going out I put my makeup and powder over it and it's perfect. Nice scent to it. My skin is looking so healthy and fresh. Will continue to use it and recommend it.
"I have been a oil of Olay customer for years. I highly recommend this product for women of color. In addition to buying their beauty creams I also buy the beauty bar soap, Shea butter. I have always been able to see how great results with my skin. I could easily do a commercial for this product and sell it, but of course it sells itself. It definitely makes you look younger. Cheers to the best beauty, anti aging product in the market. I shall remain loyal to your products."
I have used this cream for years. I love it because it is light and does not make me break out. I wear it under my makeup and at night. It also has a little sun protection which is perfect. It leave my face feeling clean and healthy after a shower and also soft and smooth and not dry.
Protects you from the sun; keeps your skin moisturized looking nice; doesn't leave a greasy feeling.
"such a great value and love how it feels on my skin! its perfect for my dry skin and and does not feel oily at all! and its great that it has a SPF of 15, and love it and use it everyday!"
"I love this face cream. My face feels smooth, soft, and moisturized. It doesn't feel greasy, thank goodness. I use it every day and could tell my skin has gotten healthier."
Worked great! Did what it was supposed to just made my face break out
I love this product but it is no longer in production. I've ordered what I hope will be a two year supply. Maybe by then I'll have found something I like as well.
"Was much creamier than I expected for such a low-cost moisture cream. Have tried many skin care products over the years, and finally am happy with Olay."
Very rich . My skin shines all day... Luv it....
This product was recommended by a friend some years ago.
Wonderful Product. I only use this product.
this product is great
Awesome product
"I read the reviews before I purchase the Facial Moisturizer Cream and what I like is that it has Sunscreen SPF 15. It is not greasy, I use it before I apply my make up and I am happy with it. I like the price which I think is not expensive. Thank You"
I've used Olay for over 30 years. I keep trying other moisturizers but always end up going back to Olay. I have combination skin and this moisturizer keeps my dry parts moisturized and my oily parts dry. It all evens out perfectly. This one has sunscreen and it feels great to know I'm helping my face keep looking younger.
"I've always loved Oil of Olay products. I use this product with a few drops of coconut oil and my skin looks bright and remains fully hydrated all day! However, I must admit I go back and forth to the high end products and revert right back to using Olay. What can I say, my skin has a thirst for their products! Truth be told, Olay never disappoints. Never. Thanks so much Olay!"
"I've been using this product since my 20's. Switched to a different more expensive moisturizer, but switched back over to this one. Great product, will be using this for a very long time. But please do not change the formula. When formulas are changed consumers tend to look to other great products."
"This product is the norm for me, over 50 years. I started in my teen because my grandmother used it and she had almost no lines in her face. I said I wanted skin like my grandmother when I get her age. I put Olay complete lotion on each morning and will continue to use it forever. Great, great product. Thank you Olay for a product that works as you say. I live in a very hot state and this product is so needed."
"Been using this product for 30 years and will never stop using it. Perfect for my skin type -- is light, not greasy. I went to a new doctor who said she couldn't believe my age -- I look so young. She then asked if I had ""work"" done. I laughed and said no -- only use my Oil of Olay! Thanks for a great product -- please do not change it!"
I love this moisturizer!! Been using this for many years. Will not use anything else. This is perfect for my combination face needs. Provides enough moisture leaving your face feel fresh and light.This is one of the very few face creams I can use. I use this both day and night. Only wish this came at a higher SPF. Can Olay please raise the SPF in this moisturizer?
"I've used Oil of Olay since I was a teenager. My mother has used it since she was young as well. She taught my sisters and I to take care of our skin from an early age, and part of that regiment was daily application of Oil of Olay. I love that it has a sunscreen in it, It soaks in quickly and leaves my skin feeling soft and protected. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Olay products since I was young. I grew up watching my mom use it. She is over 80 years old & people never guess her age. I hope I look like her when I am that age. I just love the way it leaves my skin feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I wanted something that was simple and I could wear all day and this did the job well. It had the sun protection that I wanted! But it was heavy, it took forever to absorb(if it ever did). It is also smelled quite a bit not a bad smell but a chemical one. It did not do well when I would sweat or if the weather was humid. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this for years. I use it in the morning and before bedtime. I've been tempted to try other Olay moisturizers, but I'm not sure which one. I guess I'll do some research! Thank you for your wonderful products. I use the shower soap also. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Oil of Olay products are a family tradition. I first saw my great aunt & my own mother use these products so I trust them. Complete All Day Moisture Cream is just one of my favorite Olay products. I wear it everyday with or without makeup. It keeps my 70 year old face moisturized and offers protection from the sun. With my recommendation, I have now passed this family tradition on to my daughter who also loves this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the fact that it is all in one. It is not greasy and leaves your skin feeling new and fresh. It also gives you great protection all day long. It makes my face feel the same early in the morning as it does later in the afternoon. On top of all this it's Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this for the most part, sense I was 16 yrs old ( every now and then, would try a new product, only to return to my oil of play! So thankful and now my 3 daughters are also regular users. Thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Years ago a famous super model who had tried them all told me this was the only moisturizer she would use and I have been using it ever since. I am 74 and still getting compliments on my young looking skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this daily and have for at least 10 years. I love it and love the lightness of the product. I never feel like I am wearing sunscreen or moisturizer and keeps my skin young and healthy. I am 62 years old. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this Olay in the pink bottle. I have used it for at least 25 years and will continue to use Olay as long as it is always available. It is gentle but has kept my face moisturized all day. I believe i have little wrinkles because i use Olay. Winning would just be a plus.Thank You <3 [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for almost 20 years now and am in my mid thirties. Its light, refreshing and smells great! I have minimal age spots and will continue to use it til i'm old and hopefully not wrinkled ;) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for may years. I love the look and feel of my skin and love the fact that is contains SPF. The product goes on smoothly and is not sticky you can apply the moisturizer and add your makeup right away. I am older 63 but I still think this is all I need to keep my skin looking great [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
i have been using this product for many many years...I like upon application it is easily absorbed into the skin. My face does not feel tight once I put it on. I have tried many products as I am a 70 year old woman. I still come back to Olay [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have very dry skin and have been using this product for 10 years now. This is the only product of creams I buy that moisturize well with SPF 15. The facial lotion of Oil of Olay will not work for me. However, this one is very effective. The night cream version of this one is very good too."
"I love All Day Moisturizer-normal. Seems my skin can change from oily to dry in a matter of hours. The normal is perfect! I've been using Olay products for 0ver 30 years-and my mother before that. Tested, tried, true! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My sister and I have been using this moisturizer for years I never thought much about it having sunscreen. Then my sister and I went on vacation on a cruise to Mexico. We totally forgot to put on sunscreen and we got burned pretty good only thing not burned our face and neck thanks to our Olay moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I am up at 5AM and selling fishing bait till 7 PM.

I've been using Olay moisturizer since I was 8 or 9 . I love the non greasy feel. I only use a drop to moisturizer my face. I love the extra protection from the sun. I highly recommend this product. My husband and kids use it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Love this for a light moisturizer under my makeup. Keeps my make up from filling up creases in my face and doesn't feel oily. Great for giving me that extra protection from the sun's damaging UV rays. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is one of my ""go to"" skin care products. It absorbs quickly, smells heavenly & is a simple way to keep my skin moisturized & protected. It's great on its own, but I also like to use it under makeup. I've loved Olay for decades & hope they never stop making this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this moisturizer. It is quick to use and the coverage is great! I live in Florida and don't always remember to use sunscreen. I am diligent about using this moisturizer though. This gives me reassurance that I am getting SPF 15 on my face daily. The feeling is light and not greasy. This product is tried and true! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this moisturizer for years and love it! I will be 58 this August and feel that if I DIDN'T use this product my skin wouldn't be healthy as it is! I started using Total Effects 7 in one anti-aging moisturizer with sunscreen and love this as much! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I always loved the way my Grandmothers face felt. I loved hugging her and smelling that familiar smell. It wasn't until I was a young adult that I found her secret. Oil of Olay! From that day on I started using Oil of Olay and when my daughters got older I shared my secret with them and they too have become fans of this wonderful product. We are an Oil of Olay Family! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used Olay moisturizer for years it is just part of me! I love that I get the added SPF! I have tried other brands in the past and always come back to Olay so now it's not even a question of what brand I will purchase. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wouldn't go without my Oil of Olay moisturizer daily. My face is sofa and supple. It makes me feel younger-- and everyone tells me I look younger than I am. It's the only moisturizer I have used since Oil of Olay has been sold in stores. Thanks Olay! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My mom has used Oil of Olay for many years so I thought I would start using it and I'm in love with it. I'm 49 yrs old and realize I should've started using Olay long before now but I'm hooked on now. I've been using it for a few weeks and can see and feel the difference already and the fact that is has an SPF of 15 is a plus. It's a wonderful product and I will continue to use it. Thank you. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I can really tell a difference when I use this product compared to some other products that claim to do the same. My skin looks and feels hydrated and younger looking when I use the Complete All Day Moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using Olay products over 40 years. They have always been great. And they just keep getting better. This product is light weight and absorbs well. This moisturizer has kept my skin looking great, I use it daily. Thank you for making such great affordable products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product quickly absorbs into skin as a lightweight moisturizer and does not leave an oily residue following application. The built in sunscreen adds extra protection against the damaging effects of the sun's rays. Living in a year round sunny and tropical climate makes this a vital part of my daily skincare routine! This is an excellent product for women of all ages to maintain smooth skin under their normal makeup routine. A definite A+ rating from this user!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this moisturizer since I was in my early 20s. I am now 50 and I am constantly being told I don't look my age and that my skin is beautiful. I owe these wonderful results to this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"It's not too heavy but very effective. I use it everyday and haven't gotten sunburned on my face, at all! Plus with the moisturizers people rarely come close when guessing my age! I'll be 58 soon and am often guessed to be in my 30's! Thanks to Oley!, [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this moisturizer since I was 17 years old, now at 55 I'am still using it every single day, it's gentle on the skin but it works really good at the same time, my skin has always felt soft and clear I have tried other cream but always come back to Oley.

"As children, we are greatly influenced by our parents. Growing up, I watched my mother routinely moisturize her face with Oil of Olay. I remember the incredibly soft feel of her face. Even as a child playing dress up, I knew I needed to put Oil of Olay on my face before I put my moms makeup on. Jump 30 years later and I still put it on my face everyday. My skin is as soft as I remember my moms being. I hope someday I will be able to pass that tradition on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Have used Olay products for many years. Each face lotion seems to improve. I love that it already has SPF 15 in it. Wouldn't mind if it was SPF 30. It's not greasy. Doesn't smell funny. Goes on smooth. Of course I would recommend this product. It has stood the test of time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This moisturizer is amazing! It is not oily or creamy. My coworker has great skin and she recommended it to me. She raved that her mother uses it and has youthful looking skin so I bought it and love it. I recommended it to my own family and friends and they love it too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I started using Oil of Olay in college and switched to this product for the SPF when it became available. I love the way it absorbs quickly and I think my skin looks great for 53. I've tried other brands but I keep coming back. It doesn't burn my eyes if I sweat and it's economical enough to use on my arms and legs in a pinch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is amazing. It provides the perfect amount of lasting light moisturizing with absolutely none of the oiliness often found in all day moisturizers. The addition of sunscreen, combined with a budget conscious price, make this an intelligent choice for women everywhere. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this moisturizer since my mother had recommended this to me. I have been using this product for 4 years now and I love it. The reason I have repurchased this over and over again is because of it's moisturizing effects and the fact that it has SPF 15 is a plus. It isn't too oily and it gives my face a dewy moisturized look. I have combination skin and it doesn't break me out, I think the formula is really gentle for everyday use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for years. I have tried others and always go back to this one. Very reasonably priced and I use it daily and at night. Feels great on your skin and is not too thick or too light. I recommend it to all my friends. Wonderful. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I use other Olay products day and night, but when I find myself out in the sun during the day, I put on this lightweight moisturizer with SPF. This is the same shaped bottled I remember my mom (who lived to 98!) using sans the SPF in her heyday! I love the texture and I feel confident in the SPF factor which is so important for general skin care! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Thank goodness this product has stayed the same throughout the many years I've used it........I've often asked how can they make something so perfect and wonderful for your skin any better! Each time I used it the more I love how it makes my skin silky smooth. You know what's so great......it felt like this in my 20's and still feels like this in my 50's! Keep up the great work......I love all of your products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used this product since I was 15yrs old (I am now 35). I love that it is not heavy or oily. And the little bit of sunscreen has saved me on sunny days from burning. Even though I have olive skin, I tend to burn. It smells fresh too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Nothing greasy that sits on top - this is a cream that soaks into the skin, refining the texture while protecting from the sun's exposure. it is my go-to basic for every day - even those days I don't wear makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This is by far one of the best products I've used. It's light & non-greasy. I've been using this moisturizer for 23 years. I got ID'd last month while buying wine at a grocery store. I call that a win! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product since I was in my thirties (I'm in my fifties now) and I love it! It's one of the only non-greasy products I've been able to find and I think my skin looks much younger than it's fifty four years :) I would (and have) recommend this product for anyone who needs a facial moisturizer and is not happy with greasy feeling moisturizers!!

"I've worn/used Oil of Olay moisturizer on my face as a base since I was sixteen years old! I am now 56 and my skin looks wonderful! I have added the Oil of Olay Night Moisturizer as part of my daily regimen and find that it give me an overall hydrated look, in combination with my Original oil of Olay lotion. Forty (40) years of use! I call that a FANTASTIC product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I should be a spokesperson for Complete All Day Moisturizer. I have been using the product for 37 years. After 2 applications, my skin looks very youthful and the moisturizer absorbs quickly without blocking pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay moisturizer since I was in high school and once they added the SPF it was even more of a necessity. I am now in my fifties and this product is terrific. I use it every morning after I wash my face and at night before I go to sleep. It never goes on greasy and leaves my skin feeling hydrated. I have introduced this product to my daughters as well and they use it as part of their daily regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love my Oil of Olay! I am 51 years old and I use the All Day Moisturizer every day. It nourishes my face and neck without leaving my face feel oily. Living in Vegas is really tough on your skin.

"I have been using olay of olay moisturizing cream for over 30 years, it has kept me from getting dry wrinkling skin.

(all is fine) I not only use it on my face.. but my neck and chest as well. I will always be an Oil of Olay lady!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this product since 2 years ago and I love it. It not only helps to protect my skin from sunlight, but also moisturize and make my skin tone evenly and brightly. I don't need to wear foundation to cover my dark spots or imperfections on my face because this olay's product does all those jobs. I just apply it first, then eyeliners, and then lipstick. It's quick, simple and perfect look. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This has been a staple product for me most of my life. I love the formula and how it takes care of my skin and keeps my face looking fresh. I count on this daily as my base moisturizer even when I might apply something else for extra moisture as I have gotten older, like Total Effects or Regenerist also by OLAY. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is the only moisture cream I use. It goes on smoothly and is quickly absorbed by my skin. At my age I have a few wrinkles, but Olay complete makes them less noticeable.

My 92 year old grandmother had been using olay for at least 30 years and nobody can ever say she looks her age. Her skin is flawless. She taught me about Olay and swears by this product. And grandmothers do know best so I followed her regimen and my skin is flawless and I look younger. Thank you for the best moisturizer on the market.

"I have used this product for over 15 years and could not imagine a day without it. Not only does it keep your skin looking young, it helps protect against the sun's harmful rays.

"Years ago (and I do mean years) I started using Olay Complete and it has been the best. From time to time I have tried something ""new"", but I always come back to Olay. It is a light moisturizer not heavy like some of the others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Olay moisturizer for what seems like forever. My sister recommended this to me when I was very young and at age 71 I still use it. I always get told that I look years younger than I am. I like that it is a light lotion and not heavy on the skin. Will use it forever! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used your product for over 30 some years. I am 81 years old now. I have had many women tell me what nice skin I have and I tell them I've used Oil of Olay for many years.

I have used Olay for years. Way back when it was called Oil of Olay. My sister sold another product and tried to get me to change but it didn't happen. Just really like how Olay treats my skin.

I have been using this lotion for the last several years. I spend a lot of time out doors and this is the only sunscreen that I need. It does not cause problems with stinging my eyes. It is not at all greasy. The other thing a I like is that it makes my skin soft. Have tried a few others and always come back to Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used nothing but Oil of Olay Complete for years. I use it in the morning and at night I use Oil of Olay night cream. I am 74--almost 75 --and I have people ask me all of the time what all I use on my face as I do not look 74. I tell them, :I use Oil of Olay Complete and that is all, other than Oil of Olay night cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Oil of Olay moisturizer since I was 29 years old. (I'm now 71.) It completely moisturizes my skin but is not greasy at all. People continually tell me I don't look my age and I attribute a lot of that to my use of Oil of Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used Olay for years and it's the only thing that moisturizes my face and doesn't soak in too much.

At 35 I know I needed to start using moisturizer and I asked a friend I thought my age what she used and it was Oil of Olay. She was 46 and no wrinkles and looked 35. I have used it and other products for eyes and lips since and have no wrinkles as I turn 52 next week. Love it :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product has been a favorite of mine for years. It feels good going on and I always have a bottle on hand even though I switch off with other Olay products. It may be the combination of Olay products, but at age 72, and even with the harsh winters where I live, my skin is soft to the touch and people say I don't look my age.

Olay Moisturizer is the best! I am 42 and I have been using this moisturizer since I was 15years old. This product has been passed down from my grandmother and mother.

"I have been using Olay products since my early twenties. I use the moisture bars, Daily and Nightly moisturizers. No one can ever believe how old I am, and the few wrinkles I have at 46. I owe it all to Oil of Olay. Now, my teenage daughter has begun using Olay soap and the Daily Moisturizer so the torch is also being passed to her. I know she'll be in great hands.

"I have been using this product for more than 15 years! Everyday! About 10 years ago I started using Olay Serum just before this one. I believe I will never leave this product. I have tried several other products just to come back to this one. Again and again. This product is not grease, feels like my skin absorbs well, leaving the protection layer on the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have been using Olay products since I was a teen ( my grandmother got me in the habit). I have always loved that Olay moisturizers made my skin feel soft and smooth. Because I have freckles, my face always seemed to ""change"" and new freckles appeared overnight. With Olay Broad Spectrum SPF moisturizers, I no longer have to worry so much about adding new freckles to my already freckled filled face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used Olay Moisturizer for a long time and made a change to a cheaper brand.
