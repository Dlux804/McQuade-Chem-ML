"I've been using the Daily Renewal Cream day and night for nearly a year, and my skin is smooth, supple, and very soft. I mix it with my sunscreen to make it easier to spread; it works beautifully, and it's light enough that it doesn't turn my makeup into an oil mask. I absolutely love it!"
i loooooveeethis!! use it every night as a moisturizer after removing my makeup and use it again right before i do my makeup and leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrates and also reduces the redness in my face
i think this is the same product I have a day cream and night cream from Olay. and they are lovely on my skin I suffer with dry skin and excema in the past . love these products as they help keep my skin good
"My holy grail before bed face cream. it smells great, is super moisturizing, and is affordable! it makes your skin abit greasy, so probably better for dry skin. love this!"
"Love my daily renewing cream. Great moisturizer, it goes on with a light feel and soaks into skin quickly. The moisturizer was effective and helped my skin stay well hydrated. I found the moisturizer to be gentle on my face. This is a product I buy regularly because I never want to be without it."
"It's very light on the skin, it doesn't cake up my face, the bags under my eyes have disappeared. The creases in my forehead have gone down significantly, I love the easy twist on top and easy to store. It could have a better smell to it and a better texture"
I use this product one time and I'm definitely going to buy it again is really good for your face because you can feel the soft but you can use that if you have a dry face but if your face is really oily I don't recommend this.
I like this product ok. I love the smell and it's very light on the skin unlike some creams that seem really thick and weighed down. Olay isn't cheap but it isn't expensive either. It ranks somewhere in the middle. No bad if you don't have the money for the high end creams. And you'll notice most “age defying” products are crazy high
I tried as moisturizer once and didn't find that I got the best value for the money I paid for it. It is a very thick moisturizer but I felt like it left white residue on my skin. I did not buy it again
"This is a decent cream. I have very dry skin and this cream is not moisturizing enough for my skin. If you have normal skin, then you'd probably really like this cream. I really like the anti-aging benefits of this cream and I did see improvements in the signs of aging present in my skin. It was brighter, smoother and more youthful looking. If it was more hydrating, I would have continued using this product. I think it is expensive for a drugstore brand, but Olay does go on sale frequently."
"Amazing!! Great price, lightweight, no heavy smells, not greasy. Love it!! I use it everyday!!! Took the age test on olay.com and was sad, then did as recommended and started using this along with some other play products and after a month I did the challenge again and my age has gone down 10 years. I can see a huge difference"
I love this product. I have received it as a gift and tried it. its very light on my skin and not to perfumey. which I love most about it. I guess it not that cheap but you get what u pay for so I must say its good investment when you really want a good outcome for skincare.
"This is a good moisturizer for normal to very dry skin types. It does well to protect from the sun and keep the skin plump. This is my first time using the product. Packaging is simple and elegant, it's not bad for the price point and I'd recommend it to anyone wanting to save some cash on their moisturizer"
"I used this product every night and it was enough to keep my face from drying. i would not recommend this for someone with dry skin as it does not have extreme moisture, however it is enough hydration for combination skin. I also like how thick it is, because I feel that this really helps with firming skin."
I used this product for the longest time and it works perfectly. It keeps your skin hydrated and does a nice job of moisturizing I recently stopped using it because I have super oily skin and Olay tends to cater to non oily skin but other then that it's a great product
This cream was something newer that I had in the house and it was definitely gentle going on. It personally made my skin feel a bit dry after but still had glow. The packaging was ok and there was a decent amount in it. I would recommend to those with not so sensitive skin like I have
"I just started using this product a few weeks ago. And even though it's not really for me specifically , I found that it does give me the moisture I need to start my makeup in the morning or just have a Moisturized face in the morning . My mom uses this product and raves about it . The deep smile lines that she had went away and her skin is looking a lot brighter than it did before she started using it ."
I really love this cream but for certain reasons i can't really use it as much as I would like. for one I have sensitive skin and anything with a strong scent can break me out also on oily spots it gets too greasy but works great on my dry spots. combo skin problems
i enjoy olay products since for ever . they are very nice and good for my skin type and available everywhere and all the time . i enjoy the Olay Age Defying Daily Renewal Cream for my face . it gives my face a nice glowy finish and amazing feeling around my face
I think I used a product by okay that's similar to this but not this exact product; it was a moisturizer but in a red jar and I love it! My skin is very dry and this cream was thick and cooking and moisturizing. I would use it at night and in the morning Emmy skin felt hydrated and plump. I loved it. I had a sample of it so I was sad to see it go.
I really liked this product because of the texture. It made my skin so smooth and kept it hydrated through out the day. It wasn't too expensive which was really nice too. I love the container it came in because it makes it easy to apply by just dipping your fingers in it!
"All my life I've never had people compliment me on my skin. Fat chance, with acne, then acne scars and uneven complexion. I'm 76 years old now and for the past few years have faithfully used Age Defying Daily Renewal Cream with Beta Hydroxy Complex. And the compliments on my skin keep pouring out. I keep thinking it must be the Beta Hydroxy... but I had tried other products with that and nothing has smoothed, nor given me the quality skin that this product has. My only regret is that I didn't find it sooner."
"I like this cream because its light enough to use every day, however I didnt think it made a real difference in the texture and smoothness of skin."
I love bundles . This is so great for you face . Leaves your face moist and clear. I would definitely use this product as a everyday product.
Provides hydration. If you use it overtime you will notice a difference . However it is not a major one
"My skin just lighten, glowing and look younger. I really Love this Olay Age defying cream.. Will recomend to all."
Use this every night for the last two years. My face stays smooth and wrinkle free no matter what stress life throws at me.
It works good. I would recommend to someone older though. This was my first time using it. It was on the pricey side but a okay value. It gentle on your skin
This is an amazing product. I noticed minor improvement within the first couple of days. After about 2 weeks though people were commenting on how I looked younger and had a healthy glow to my skin.
"This cream does a great job hydrating my face, but thats about it. I feel like I would have to apply the cream everyday for 3 years to really see any slight difference in my face for aging"
"This is another great anti aging product, it targets wrinkles and fine lines and plumps and smooths skin. It is very gentle on the skin and a great value, younger your moneys worth for sure. My only complaint is that its a very small size."
I don't have any wrinkles yet but I do have some fine lines and I do feel this has helped a bit as I don't see them as bad. There are far better products out there for olays pricing
Have used and trust In Olay creams for almost my whole life. From 13 I started using night regenerist and now this and it's a godsend. I get so upset when I start to run out. Money is of no issue for the results I see its worth it.
I love this product! It is so smooth and leaves your face feeling very refreshed with out being oily. I would recommend this product to anyone who has normal to dry skin.
olay is just a wonderful brand it has amazing things you can mess with but this product is amazing it helped my skin from not being so dry. The packaging is great. i would like to try more things from that brand.
"Glides on smoothly and is thick enough to feel like I have moisturizer on, but not too thick that I can't apply makeup afterward. I've bought multiples of these."
I may not be older but this cream works great. I have combination skin and it doesn't make my face oily and it's very gentle on the skin. It definitely meet my expectations
"I had a lot of flakes.on my face at one point, and I found that some of Olay's products would attempt to moisturize and prevent it. This product does perform it's intended purpose, but does not prevent things like dryness. Not for me at least."
I love every product I have purchased from this company. I had a client who only used this product since she was young. She put it on every night even when she was sick. I'm glad she told me about this.
"Very smooth, will keep using this products. I have very dry skin so it helps with it. Gentle.. the price isn't that bad for the product. It works just as good as something high end"
"I buy this for everyone! It's recommended highly. I've used it a few times and every time I'd smell it, it just brings warmth. It reminds me of watching my mom do her face routine, it'll always be in mine as well!"
"Clean packaging and affordable. It smells odd, but I suppose it's just because it's plain. I've only used it once, but I didn't notice a small reduction of lines around my eyes, mouth, and T-Zone. It's in the top ten of personal recommends."
"I absolutely love Olay products, so this was a no-brainer for me to try. After a month of use I noticed my fine lines starting to fade, even my laugh lines were better. It left my face soft but not oily. I highly recommend this."
It works really well I have a day and also a night cream and I love them! At first I thought they made my skin greasy but it's like a lotion that has to absorb.
I love that it rubs in really smoothly and is not greasy. It made my face feel so fresh and clean. This was my first time using it and the only reason iits 4 out of 5 is the price.
"not overly impressed with this cream. the consistency wasn't what i was anticipating when i bought it. may be just not right for my skin, but i felt like it almost sat on top of my skin and didnt really absorb in!"
Feels good I use as a night cream because it's a little heavy on the skin and leaves your skin feeling a little bit heavy but I do like it I just recommend to sleep with it on and wash off in the morning keeps your skin feeling hydrated and smooth
I also use the age defying soap as a daily routine. It works. I swear by it. My mother before me also. I will continue to use this item. As it met all of my expectations.
"Not greasy feeling, goes on smoothly. And I've really noticed a difference in my skin! It's not high dollar nor cheap. Could work with anyone's budget"
I love this moisturizer. I generally apply it at night. Keeps my skin feeling hydrated and soft. During winter months I use this in the morning doesn't leave me feeling oily.
This is a great daily cream for my oily skin. The price is reasonable and doesnt break the bank. This cream does exactly what it needs to to my skin. The secure packaging of the bottle ensures the cream does not get dry.
I've used this product for a long time. It's a nice moisturizer under makeup. It's not bad priced and the jar is convenient. Im not disappointed in this product at all. Wish they'd use better ingredients though.
This face cream is amazing. It feels so good. However it's almost more expensive than high end luxury brands. So there's no point. Which really sucks because it feels so nice especially on dry winter skin.
It was a great moisturizer. I absolutely loved the products it was gentle on my skin and kept it feeling soft all day. I even want to start using it at night to wake up fresh and soft
it was nice enough but i can't say i really noticed any difference in my skin. sometimes (depending on the serums i used underneath) it would pill up on my skin and leave a really weird and greasy residue.
It personally made my skin feel a bit dry after but still had glow. The packaging was ok and there was a decent amount in it. I would recommend to those with not so sensitive skin like I have..
I have used this moisturizer about 6 months and am very happy with it. It goes on super smooth and feels smooth all day. I would definitely recommend this moisturizer. Olay Age Defing Daily Renewal Cream
I've used this for years. It's a great night cream and I believe it to be as effective and much more expensive creams at a lower price. It was what I expected and I would buy it again. A larger jar would be nice though.
I used this daily & it made me look younger the more I used it! Used it for 3 years and I seen a difference. A little price but worth it and the packaging was very nice and convenient! Always re purchase.
As I get older my skin needs more hydration to look its best. I switched from the classic Olay moisturizer to this awhile back and like how much thicker it is. It is also much more hydrating! My skin is very happy!
"This is most definitely a tried and true product. My Memaw swore by it and it works just as great for me today, not only leaving me with amazing skin but childhood memories as well."
"I feel like this works well, I wish the container was bigger but that is only because it seems so small that I keep losing track of where it is in my bathroom."
"My mom actually uses this she likes it but doesn't love it, she can live without it . I say it claims things that don't really happen but the smell is pretty good ."
It's a really smooth cream with a really nice smell. I like to use it in the morning and at night even without having wrinkles because it leaves my skin feeling smooth and hydrated.
I love a daily moisturizer and this one definitely exceeded my expectations. It was super gentle and hydrating and I love that it's an anti aging product you can just slap on after washing your face. Definitely recommending this to others!
"This is a staple. No weird smell, just smells very clean and I put it on at night. My skin feels refreshed and soft in the morning and I have noticed a bug change in my skins texture"
"Leaves my face feeling hydrated and protected. I highly recommend because this doesn't feel super heavy like other creams I have tried in the past. It has worked well on my neck, as well. I am really seeing a difference with this product!"
"My mom used this her whole life and then she introduced it to me when I was young, and I've been using it ever since. Of course I've tried lots of other moisturizers too along the way, high-end and drugstore, but I always go back to this one. When I put it on it literally feels like I'm giving my skin a drink of water, its amazing and so hydrating but it doesn't feel greasy at all and doesn't break me out. In love!"
"I've been blessed with slow-aging skin but I'm not immortal so when I noticed my skin was dulling (no wrinkles, yet) I remembered using Oil of Olay skin cream many years ago so I decided to try this line. Fast forward three weeks, at the hospital, an emergency, no makeup and scared and my daughter looks over at me and says, ""My God, Mom, your skin looks great."" Timing off, product ""sold!""."
Smells. Eye good makes slime smooth and makes me feel younger keep skin very soft love this product
Didn't liked that product I also used Olay day and night cream as well but didn't find it good totally a waste of. Money
This cream is nice and thick but has very little scent witch is wonderful and soaks in without being too greasy!
Great price. Never leaves skin feeling over moisturized or greasy. Goes on smoothly and not heavy at all.
Makes my face feel moisturized immediately. I definitely miss it when I skip routine. I would recommend this to anyone starting out.
Love this for the price. Great daily cream that doesn't leave an oily feel. Noticed a difference in my skin within a week will continue to use daily
Always happy with Olay - scent and effectiveness. I find it a little heavy for everyday but still a great product.
This is my favorite by far. Goes on smooth and I noticed my eyes looked refreshed. I didn't even get a good nights sleep. It's a keeper
Great product and a good price!! Definitely want to keep up with using this product daily. It's really helped my skin
i lowe this cream is my favorite my face fell so soft like baby's face i trully lowe and recomand to used ewery day
"I have very dry skin, and this product was about as good as putting water on my face. Even after three applications, i was still flakey"
I liked the product but did not notice an extreme change in the appearance of my face with time. I will however continue to. Use this product.
Love this product! Made my skin feel amazing and soft the next day. But the only downside is that I have found better products.
"This didn't work as well as advertised. I expected a better outcome from the reviews I read, but to no avail."
Love this product! It is light and effective. Moisturizes my skin and makes it feel good and greaseless.
Love olay products.literally been using these since I was young because my mom always did. Hydrating and refreshing
Use this quite regularly. It's soft and absorbs well. I like the night cream too. Cheap and cheerful brand and often on offer.
This product is so soft! Doesnt break me out like most products do. Loved the feeling afterwards. And the results are amazing!
Works really well. It doesn't dry out your skin or get it greasy. It's a little pricey but affordable compared to the other skin care companies.
Got a sample of this and didn't have enough to so a thorough review. Product was light and smelled good.
Not my favorite. Just needed something to try. I was a first time user and i also forgot to use it every day
Gotta love a good moisturizer!!!! Very hydrating for me as I get dry but also doesnt leave feeling oily. Just fresh!
I love Olay products! They smell great! A little pricey for some things but it definitely works great on skin! Even for sensitive skin!
I love the way this product smells! It's the perfect cream to use daily without making my skin oily.
Very hydrating and smooth. I have definitely seen a difference in the eye area and I am loving it! There is no harsh smell either!
I love this product for these reasons below: How it leaves the skin feeling Soothing nature I WOULD USE AGAIN!
My skin gets dry when the seasons change. This helps me feel moisturized without feeling overly greasy.
"It's nice, but I'm not sure how I like the feeling of it on my skin at first. After it absorbs in it gets better."
"this was good , i just didn't really use it enough to see a difference . it was my first time using it"
"I use this moisturiser every morning, it's really smooth and feels really nice, I use this every morning."
I love this product from Olay and my mother loves it too! She introduced me to it when I was 21 and I've been using it on and off ever since
Quality product at a price I can afford. I use it at night. I am pleased with the product. I plan on buying it again.
My grandmother put me on to play their skin products are so great such good quality for such affordable prices looks luxurious
I like this product. I like the way it makes my face feel. I dont think it does anything special but it's a decent moisturizer
Hands down my favorite facial cream. This is my go to every morning and the olay night before bed. It leaves my skin refreshed and bright.
Nice and thick so a great option when you're wanting a thicker cream. Goes a long way so will last longer
My favorite Cream Very useful for skin cleanses and softens and opens the skin I really like the products of this brand
I love it !!! My face is never dry especially during the winter I get so dry on my face this is the best
I absolutely love this product. It leaves my skin feeling so soft. It's affordable. Seems to do exactly what it's meant to.
Olay has never let me down. Their products are very affordable but also good quality. Goes on smooth and makes skin feel great.
of this brand I have only used this in general I work it is good. I recommend it. hydrate the area of the eyes
Does this even skin tone? Olay Age Defying Daily Renewal Cream is a wonderful cream that works extremely well. This cream compliments the cleanser that will make your skin look younger. The older you get the more you need creams by Olay. They will help you defy your age. It goes on soft and smooth and absorbs quickly. It…
"This is my absolute favorite moisturizer! It's a tried and true favorite, because this product works! It doesn't make my face feel greasy, and it leaves my face feeling so soft and hydrated. This is something that can always be found in my medicine cabinet!"
"I really like Olay Age Defying. I usually use it before going to bed. The feeling it leaves on my face is really nice and I can really tell my skin is being moisture. The only bad thing I can say about this cream is that I'm not a fan of the fragrance. Other than that I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good, affordable night or day cream."
"I have been using Olay Age Defying Classic Daily Renewal Cream for several years. It makes my face and neck feel amazing, it leaves my skin feeling moisturized, refreshed and looking good! I love ALL of the Olay products that I've tried. It has taken me long time to find a product that I wanted to stick with, but Olay is it for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using Olay's Age defying daily cream for over a year now. I must have finished 4-5 containers of them and I love it! It feels so light and soft on my skin. I have oily skin and the oil-free formula is great for me. And it moisturizes perfectly, as I don't get dry itchy skin after shower etc. I highly recommend it!"
"I love this product! I use it at night or when I want a tan or after using the Regenerist Microdermabrasion Kit. It is great and oil free, just like the lotion, but without the SPF. Don't be fooled by the gentle feel. In my limited experience, it is an exellent exfoliator, even though it is very gentle feeling and leaves my skin very moisturized, but oil free! According to my dermatologist, it also prevents future acne, just like the cleanser and lotion with SPF."
The best early age defying you can use it daily for renewal your skin and looks younger
"I wear this every day! Super lightweight. Nice scent, not too strong. Affordable and effective!"
I use this on my feet. It doesn't work well for my face but great on my feet for dry heels
I didn't notice any results from this. It's a little pricey for the lack of results
Smells great. A little pricey. I like it then I don't. Not sure if I would buy again tbh.
A wonderful cream very soft love it putting every day I can not dispense with it I advise
Absolutely no difference. Had my money wasted on this one as its not really effective at all
"Greasy and I did not like the smell of it. Although it was hydrating, I probably won't get it again unless it was super on sale. I would only use in the winter for my very dry skin."
"I didn't see any difference with this cream.I didn't like the smell, its smell like something my grandma would have. Its tick and takes forever to sink into the skin. I would not recommend."
"I enjoy using this product. It makes my skin feel soft and moisturized. Not sure if it's defying my age, but I figured I'll keep using it. Hahaha! But seriously, I like the way it makes my skin feel so I will continue to use it."
Definitely notice a difference in dark spots and wrinkle reduction overnight. Also helps with dark circles. Also lightweight and absorbs super quick !!
I have used Olay for many years. I am in my early 50's and as I get older I find my skin is losing its elasticity. The age defying daily renewal has helped putting life back into my skin.
"Super light weight on the skin, half of my face is dry and half is greasy and this works for both. It's gentle on the face and is not scented so it won't cause breakouts for sensitive skin. And! It's super cheap!"
Love this product it works great and make your skin feel amazing afterwards. It is everything I was needing and gentle. Pricing is amazing as well. And the packaging is perfect I would recommend.
"I am 54 years old,and always have loved Olay from when I was 30.This product makes my skin feel smoother and I don't look as old as I am.This product works well and I recommend it highly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am beautiful and look 15 years younger. Everyone can't believe my skin is so soft. Thank you for that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using several olay products for years. Have loved most of the products and will continue to use them. Would also recommend them to others. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this cream along with total effects and my skin looks great! It has helped my acne and seems to keep my skin clear and refined. I would definately recomened it!
I was really disappointed with the results of this product m. I don't recommend it for women over 60!
My favorite face cream! Keeps my face looking fresh and young! Use it everyday and you will see a difference in your skin!
This product really is great. I haven't been using it long enough to notice a difference though. I will continue to use it.
Works great especially for under the eye area. Decreases wrinkles and puffiness under the eye. Would definately recommend this product
Goes on nice smells a little weird leave your face feeling little sticky at first but then drives nicely affordable
I use this cream every day! Extremely soft to the skin and not super heavy. High quality without being too expensive.
"Make skin soft, smooth, and glowy would highly recommend to anyone not only as age defying but also just a good face cream."
Daily! I use this every morning after I wash my face. So good drugstore moisturizer for under my makeup.
"I use Olay Age Defying Daily Renewal Cream before I go to bed. It helps reduces the wrinkles and dark,tired my eyes. Great stuff."
Olay age defying daily renewal cream will leave your skin so so soft. With the olay name you know it's good.
Must have product. I use everything night and before makeup routines. Keeps my face looking glowing and radiant.
I have used this product for more years than I can remember it is gentle to the skin and makes my skin look amazing would not use anything else
I really like this cream. It is of high quality for the price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Can this product be layered with the Olay age defying anti wrinkle day lotion with sunscreen broad spectrum spf 15??
"I absolutely love this face cream, after using it my face feels very soft and less wrinkle. I would highly recommend this product."
"Love this! Love how rich and creamy it is and how, at the same time, it never feels heavy on my skin."
Great value for the results. Love this stuff. Makes my skin feel younger and smoother
"Great cream, smells nice. A little on the oily side but gentle. Seems to keep skin hydrated."
"I love this product, because it just seems to work! However, I can't find it anymore!"
