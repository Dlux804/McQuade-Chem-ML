"I waited a little bit to leave this review. It is awesome! I get weird skin irritations which just itch and won't go away because of the vicious cycle of it itching and me scratching it which further irritates it. This cream absorbs into my skin VERY easily. Instant relief. Also! It doesn't smell bad! All in all, 10/10 would buy again."
"This is a great product, purchased for dry itchy skin which I get during dry winter months and it provided immediate and fast relief. Definitely recommend!"
'Piel Sana' is a great cream that works wonders on hives. I strongly recommend it. It's actually surprising how fast and well it works. I swear by this cream
"My jar had a quarter sized amount of product inside like it had been used up. A waste of money There was no product on the outside of the jar showing it leaked, someone just put a practically empty jar with this others. I tossed it in the trash so I don't even know if it us a good product or not."
