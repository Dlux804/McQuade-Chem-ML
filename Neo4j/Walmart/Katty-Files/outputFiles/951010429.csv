Been using for 2 weeks. Love the cream! Waiting to see in a month for results.
This stuff really works. I use it on my arms mostly and it absorbs really quickly and lasts all day.
It would be an understatement to say that this is not the best cream I have ever used. I'm the graveyard queen of creams. I have a basket full. I've been using it going on 2 weeks and already see a difference. It's all natural
"Disappointing. It's decent as a moisturizing cream goes, but after a good long trial I saw no change in crepey skin tone."
