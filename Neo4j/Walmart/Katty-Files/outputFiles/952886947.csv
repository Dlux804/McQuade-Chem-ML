"I've been using the serum for two months and on my second bottle (: I use it Faithfully , and you have to moisturize your face (: and what I love about this product is there isn't a lot ingredients which is perfect (: the formula is awesome ! And the price is even better! I am 45 years old and I'm worth it LOL [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this product For a few weeks now and I am amazed at how hydrating it has been for my skin! The product itself is lightweight and a little bit goes a long way so the value is definitely worth the price. Use in conjunction with the 10% Vitamin C Serum to even away wrinkles while hydrating twice a day for great results. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I��ve tried other hyaluronic acid serums in the past but this one killed the game! My skin felt so amazing after this very first use!! I'll keep using and buying this product for a long time! Great formula guys! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This makes my skin look so happy! It's a quality product and really makes it easy part of my routine. My mom got jealous of my skin so I bought her a bottle! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really liked the product, it moisturized my skin a lot. The texture is pleasant and the results during prolonged use were positive. I received the free product to test and it's okay, I recommend it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Being pregnant means I can't get botox anymore, but being able to use this all natural non-paraban product has really helped the fine and deep lines in my forehead. Not to mention the non-oily formula has helped my skin stay moisturized and radiant, especially during the cold Fall and Winter seasons. I received this item complimentary from influenster in return to give my honest and legit review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for a few weeks now, and I really like it! It absorbs easily and feels lightweight on my skin. I have pretty oily skin, and don't feel like this clogs my pores like a lot of other products do. After a few weeks of use, my skin feels smoother and more hydrated. I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster, and I greatly appreciate the opportunity to try it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used this in addition to the L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Derm Intensives Vitamin C Serum for about 1 month and noticed some difference in my skin. My skin felt more supple and I noticed less fine lines around my eyes. It felt like it hydrated my face pretty well too. I used twice a day- once in the morning and once before bed. I received both products complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It is quite thick and unlike water. Use this as a combo with another related L'Oréal product and I think it did it's job. It has no scent and I applie it every night before the cream. I can feel my face is smoother. And I got this product as a tester to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product. LOREAL - 1.5% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum is your skin solution for dryness and wrinkles. My skin is prone to dryness in the colder months and this has helped! It's gentle enough for daily use on my sensitive skin. I'm so glad I found this product to add to my skincare routine. I recieved this product complimentary from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product to test thanks to Influenster, and I couldn't be more thankful! I have been using this product along with the Vitamin C Serum, and I can definitely see a change in the fine lines that were starting to appear on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and have been using it for a few weeks. I can't see a ton of difference - but at this point don't have many wrinkles - however, my skin does feel tighter and more vibrant after use. I will continue to use and am interested in trying out the cream alongside this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this complimentary from Influenster and I enjoyed this product overall. Hyaluronic Acid is highly praised in the skincare and beauty world because it attracts water to the skin and holds it. This felt good on the skin and has a good amount of Product in it. Great bang for your buck. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Is it weird that my favorite thing about this is the dropper as well as the texture of the product? I also like that the smell isn't too strong and it leaves my skin feeling hydrated, not oily. (I received this for free as a part of an Influenster campaign along with the vitamin-C serum, but I liked this better)"
I received this product for free in exchange for my review. I've been using this product for a few weeks and I love it! It makes my face feel smooth and healthy. It absorbs nicely without any greasy residue. It is the perfect size for travel too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recieved this product for testing purposes. I have used hyaluronic acid before but what I like about this one is that it is not watery like others I have tried. It's a serum consistency which makes me feel like my skin can actually absorb it which is more beneficial. I love this product combined with the vitamin c serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I cannot believe how much this product is true to what it does. I have seen such a difference in my skin. It's light on your sling and the smell of this product is amazing. My mother already has purchased one for herself! Definitely recommend it! I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this Hyaluronic Acid as part of a complementary package. I'm usually not a fan of chemical concoctions, but after applying the serum I could feel it grow warm on my face. After just the first application in combination with the Vitamin C serum, I saw my face become brighter and some of my spots reduced. I've been using them almost every day for a few weeks and my skin is so much better. I've never been this clear for so long. No breakouts. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product for about a month and I love it! A little bit goes a long way and it makes your skin feel very refreshed. I have been getting lots of complements lately on how good my skin looks. This will definitely be a constant in my skin routine. I recieved this complementary for review and I couldn't be happier with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a decent, no frills hyaluronic acid serum. Fragrance free and non-irritating on my sensitive oily skin. The weather is cold and dry currently where I live, and this adds a noticable hydrating effect when I use it. I layer it under my moisturizer and love that it's not sticky or tacky and dries down quickly. Great drugstore option for any skin type looking to add a hydrating layer into their routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. It left my face & neck feeling so soft and smooth to the touch. When I use this I wash my face, tone, apply this and then a vitamin c serum. And lastly my water base moisturizer. It definitely fits well in my skincare routine. I've been seeing great results. I also received this complimentary for my honest feedback. I'd definitely be restocking this for regular routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for a little over a month. I've really enjoyed it! After washing and patting dry my face I use the revitalift vitamin c, followed by this serum.

I absolutely love this stuff! A little bit goes a long way and I have extremely sensitive skin but this is absolutely great for sensitivity and dry skin. My face has really toned up a lot and is a lot smoother. The best compliment I've ever received... my coworker asked me if I was wearing foundation on bare skin because she said I look “flawless”. Thanks to this and the vitamin c serum. Go get em! #complimentary #influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this complimentary in order to test it out for Influenster, and I am saying with certainty this is something I am planning to start purchasing and is fully incorporated into my daily skin routine! I use this and the vitamin C together in the morning and night, in a clean face. As you can see in the pictures, the mines under my eyes have nearly disappeared, way less noticeable, as well as my smile lines! I am in love! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got to try this serum as a part of Influenster's campaign and boy was I surprised! This serum is easily blends into the skin and brings that radiance on your face. True to word, it's a good value for money. Easy to apply. If you are looking for some good serum within your budget this is the right one. Very hydrating with pure hyaluronic acid."
I've been using this serum for about a month with the vitamin C cream and my fine lines have definitely been reduced! My skin is softer and overall complexion has improved. You only need to use a little bit so your product will last a long time :)

Thanks Influenster for send me these products to review for free for testing purposes only [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I really enjoyed using this product as well as the packaging. The dropper makes application easy and mess-free. My face felt so much plumper and less dry after two weeks of using this serum.

Thanks yo Influenster for giving me this product to test and i bought one after. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I loved this hyaluronic acid serum, because after only a week of using it, I can see my skin more beautiful and feel much better. I like that it does not have perfume, it is absorbed very fast. Newly applied, the skin feels sticky, but once it is absorbed, the skin feels silky. Then I can apply the moisturizer, the sunscreen and the base for my makeup. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is an awesome serum! I don't normally use face serums and stick to moisturizer, but ever since I started using this product I've noticed my fine lines are a lot smoother and my skin is a lot more radiant! Will definitely be repurchasing. I received this product free through Influenster in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"This acid serum is great for smoothing out your skin and giving it that plump look. The packaging is glass and so luxurious looking. The only downside for this product is that it has an oddly after smell to it. Other than that I think the product itself works amazing. I received this complementary for testing purposes, all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"A few days ago I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and I am impressed! I love the way it leaves my skin feeling moisturized, but I don't like how fast it dries! That would be the only con. But other than that it is a great product to apply to the face as soon as you wake up and to end your night time routine before going to sleep. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this from Influenster. If I'm being honest I don't feel like I had a sudden change in my complexion from this. I would use this at night before bed after removing my makeup. I guess it added hydration as we head into our colder season but honestly it wasn't a major change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I used this for the last couple of weeks along with the vitamin c serum and it has worked out pretty well.

"I always wanted to have and try a serum with hyaluronic acid, this product is incredibly good, its 1.5% acid allowed my fine lines of expression to discolour a bit, leaving my skin much softer and more lush, it's amazing I would love to continue testing it for a lot more time [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

After I cleanse my face, apply toner, pat in the vitamin c serum, I add two drops of this acid on the palm of my hand and dab the product onto my face. I follow up with gentle patting and applying moisturizers. It has helped my dry skin retain moisture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"First of all I'd like to say I have a greasy oily. Sensitive skin which would react if I apply on anything new, but I have been using vitamin C serum and Hyaluronic acid serum for some few weeks and my skin hasn't reacted or anything but it feels soft and supple, very light weight on my skin applies smoothly and dries fast. it is more like a gel than a watery serum. I think it is a winner for its price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I thankfully received this from Influenster as a complimentary gift!! I couldn't believe how my skin felt and looked better after just a few uses! Our HA production declines as we get older, this serum helps to give your skin that newly plump and replenished look!"
Pro tip- follow up this product with the L'Oréal Revitalift Pure Vitamin C Serum! You can thank me later!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this every night for about ten days I and definitely see some improvement in my skin. I like that it dries very quickly so you don't have to wait a long time before usinf moisturizer. I have been using it in place of a serum. The price is a little more than I would typically pay but you only have to use a small amount so it will last a while! I got this for free for review purposes from Influenster but this is my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I want to preface this review by saying that I received this item complimentary from Influenster. That does not effect my review in anyway.

I had HUGE pores, for which I've been using Azealic Acid as recommended by my dermatologist and it didn't do much. My pores are pretty much gone!!! I will definitely be buying these when they're empty! GO BUY THEM!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I'm more than shook with this serum. It's extremely hydrating but does not leave your face too oily or shiny. The texture of the serum leaves your face feeling velvety smooth. I've only been using it for 2 days and I'm a happy customer so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Y'all this stuff is awesome! It's very affordable but it is a quality product. It's fragrance free (which I like), and it feels cool and smooth on my skin. Some serums, when applied before makeup, can make my skin feel oily throughout the day but this did not, 10/10 would definitely recommend! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is typically dry in the Fall & Winter season so having a great serum like this one is essential.

Hyaluronic acid serum is one of my favorite products for the skincare. I use it in the morning after washing my face. The skin feels very refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I purchased a bottle of this serum. I am 56 and have the ""11's"" between my eyebrows - distinct and fairly creased now. I have only used this for 4 days and those 2 deep lines are nearly vanished. I am extremely pleased with results and moreso given that the product is so well priced."
I purchased this serum about three days ago (after seeing a commercial on TV) and I am impressed beyond words by what I'm seeing! I have wrinkles around my mouth (I am 66 years old) and after just a few days of use they are diminishing!! I am so excited!!! ❤️
"I have been using the same product for years, and then, it just wasn't working for me. I decided to try a few new products and this is one of them. I love it. It works well for my sensitive skin. I remove my makeup, then apply the serum and follow with the moisturizer."
I love L'Oreal's 1.5% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum. I use it every night for about 2 months and I've seen a huge change in my skin. My forehead wrinkles are less noticeable and my skin is plum and youthful! Highly recommend. I already bought another bottle.
I've been using this 2 times a day for about 3 weeks. I get extra dry skin in winter especially on my hands. I've been applying to backs of my hands along with my face. I can see only minimal improvement. L'Oréal claims this serum attracts 1000x it's weight of moisture. I'm not impressed with the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this serum and the vitamin C together they leave my skin so soft and flawless. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was able to try this product. I like it. It goes on smooth and scent is pleasant. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using this for 5 days, my skin is more bouncy ! Love this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product!!! I feel like I've been glowing since I've started using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have used many more expensive anti-aging products, but this one is the only one I can endorse that it works! Wrinkles around my eyes, under eye bags, labial folds, and lip creases are almost all gone after 4 months of use. Fulless in my face has been restored! I will never stop using this product!"
This serum has made my skin the smoothest it has ever been.
I've been using this for 2 months now. There is no difference. I get the same results just using regular moisturizer. I can't believe i spent this money. It's not a cheap product. So disappointed.
"If I could only afford to use one produce, this would be it. I used it on my face, neck, a decollete. It only took a couple weeks to see the difference in texture."
i saw this product on tv and i immediately knew it would be a great product since i have loved the way serums work on my face and this product delivers i recommend it 100%
I bought this product 3 weeks ago I applied 2 times per day and since the day 3 I noticed the difference how it left my skin so smooth and hydrated another important thing is that you can use before do you make up and don't make you sweat.
"It's okay. A little sticky. Once I accidentally used too much and my skin felt oily, not hydrated. I can see a bit of difference in some of my fine lines, disappearing. I can't always apply with my schedule, and the reverse effect happens If i miss a day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was lucky enough to receive this product complimentary for testing purposes and fell on love! The bottle provides easy application and you can apply as little or as much as you need to. It left my skin feeling hydrated and smooth, and I noticed my complexion improve after using it daily, day and night. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs something new in their skin care regimen! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like the product a lot but that dropper top is worthless, it basically just falls off & doesn't really screw on right. Which is mainly annoying until you have to fly anywhere. I tried to seran wrap it but it still opened up & dumped everywhere, lucky it also was in a bag but that's a pretty expensive bottle to not be able to travel with it if it cant sit upright, without moving around"
"I am glad I bought this. It's plumbing effect is immediately noticeable, and I love how it makes my skin feels so smooth. Definitely recommend"
I am neither dry nor oily. This gives me a nice hydration without feeling heavy or sticky. I love the price compared to department store products. Very nice under makeup!

I went from Phoenix to New York & When I unpacked my bags the bottle leaked & I lost almost the whole bottle. It is very expensive & I feel that the top should be super tight on the bottle and not leak out. I am highty disappointed that I lost my mon
I've been using this for 2 weeks after washing my face and before applying my night cream (once a day). I love this! I wake up with silky smooth skin. I feel like I've just had a facial. It delivers on what it promises.

"I received this product from Influenster for free but these opinions are all my own! I'm in love with this product! I use daily in the Am and Pm! This product has been a game changer in my skin routine! My skin texture , hydration and appearance has improved dramatically since using this product! I love how I have all day hydration and firmness since using this product! I will never be without it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this for free for testing purposes. First of all, the bottle is beautiful and makes it seem like a high-end product! It absorbs super fast + it works great! My fine lines were definitely reduced + my face felt super soft afterwards! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this product from the store, tried it and was so disappointed...probably because I am so used to the Peter Thomas Roth Water Drench Serum which has 75% hyaluronic acid complex and mineral complex. I had high expectations on this product but when I applied it on my face it leaves a white glue-like residue and did not get the lasting hydration and plump skin it promised... not worth buying it"
"I have been using for about a week, so far I have not noticed any difference. It was recommended by a nurse from a dermatologist office. It does feel sticky, but I'm assumming it is supposed to feel that way. My rating is reflecting average, because I can't post an actual rating at this time, I will follow up after I finish the bottle."
I bought this and it is way thinner than the commercial. Have used for 2weeks day and night and zero results. Very disappointed
Pure and simple. Great ingredients. High quality packaging. Overall a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Always had great skin but getting older and this has kept my aging face looking younger. Plumps it well with the hydration it provides. Been using this for almost 1 year now. Love it.
"I will be returning this product after two weeks. I am not impressed with this expensive facial treatment, you cannot get full face coverage with just 2 to 3 drops of serum. I had better luck with the Neutrogena products."
When I tried this it works wonders for my skin. It help me remove all my dark spots and keeping me looking nice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This feel very light when you apply it. You have to be careful that you don't apply to much because it can make you feel greasy. But it's an good product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
After reading all the hype on this I decided to give it a try. 3 months later I really don't see any difference. I did read up on it and the Hyaluronic Acid molecule is too big to penetrate your skin. It does however attract moisture to your skin but there are better products out there. I won't buy again. Waste of money.
"I expected by now, 4 months later, I would see a signaficant difference. However, has not happened,"
"I bought this at CVS last month, I saw it on Dr. OZ, this stuff is great!!It makes my skin so soft and bright [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I bought this product two weeks ago. I feel it has lived up to my expectations, my skin feels great and look well rested. I feel it has helped reduce the appearance of wrinkles. I would definatly buy again."
"I received this in my Voxbox accompanied by the Derm Intensive 10% Serum. I would use this after the other serum. I found this most useful in my dry, sensitive areas like around my nose, my chin, and under my eyes. I would definitely purchase again, though I would have liked it to have a scent. I also think it left my skin a tad oily. Overall though, I would say a good product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was surprisingly surprised because this serum really moisturizes my skin well. I've used it for about three weeks and I don't see any noticeable differences, however I can appreciate this product just because it really keeps my face moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary through Influenster to test out and give my honest review. This product was great because it did not make my skin feel super oily after using, and did not cause any breakouts. I'm pretty hesitant about what I use on my skin, but I liked using this daily, and definitely felt a little more ""dewy."" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free for exchange for my honest review. I like the look and feel of this product. It looks like a super expensive chic product but it's pretty affordable. I love the way my skin feels after. It doesn't feel dry or oily. I have to continue using the product to see more differences, but overall, I like the feel so far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This was sent to me through Influenster. For me it felt like I was putting a thicker water in my face. I didn't really feel it helped much with my fine lines. It soaked fine in my skin but I don't think I'd use it alone. Definitely coupled with another face product makes it feel better. I'm not 100% sure I love this one! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I LOVE this stuff. A little bit goes a LONG way and has instant hydration, plumping, and brightening effects.i just ran out after using daily and noticed improvement in both the texture and appearance of my skin. I already reupped an am proud to call this a skincare staple."
"I received this product as a free sample, and bought a second because it's AMAZING. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Received through Influenster.
"Tried it for 3 days only because the product caused dryness - especially around my cheeks. Also it didn't absorb well, leaving a thick sticky feeling. However, the packaging was nice and with lots of information. I'll stick to my Clarin's serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really really like this product and I saw results in just a little over a week. Definitely made my skin look firmer and brighter. The only reason I did not give 5 stars is L'Oréal seems to discontinue a lot of the products I like after a couple of years. I realize they want to keep getting better but sometimes the replacement is not as good which can be disappointing.
I have been using this for the past several weeks and I absolutely love it! It's absorbs quickly into the skin and leaves it feeling so moisturized and soft! It's works great with all of my other products! Can I dunk my whole body in this? Asking for a friend.

I like this serum. It is very smooth and thin. It applies so easy and doesn't add any oil to my skin. It dries moderately fast and my skin feels very hidrated after applying. The bottle is fancy and the dropper makes it easy to apply.
Ps. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've tried several different hyloronic acids and this is comparable to more expensive options. You get a very decent amount of product for the price and it will effectively hydrate. I like to mix a drop in with my foundation as well or my cream moisturizer for added hydration.
I received this product free of charge through Influenster. I will purchase on my own when I run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this over a month ago and have been using it since. My current foam cleanser has hyaluronic acid, so paired with this it's on another level. My skin is always soft after the use of it. It's not as highly concentrated as my Korean HA's, but this is a very nice product. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complementary for testing purposes about 6 weeks ago. I have combo dry skin. The first day I used this my skin didn't know what to think. I was quite glowy that day. But by the second day my skin had figured it out and has been soft, smooth, and super hydrated without being greasy or sticky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and I am thrilled tha I did. This product isn't heavenly. After only a couple weeks of use, my skin looks smoother and pores look smaller. Makeup also looks better when put on top. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this almost a month ago and have been using it daily. I already was using a facial cleanser that contained hyaluronic acid, and this just brings it to the next level. I love how smooth my skin feels after it soaks in and continues to feel smooth. I haven't noticed any reduction in fine lines or in the elasticity of my skin, but I'm still a big fan. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product. I received it as a complimentary tester from Influenster. I use it morning and night. I love how it really makes my skin feel moisturized and plump. If I don't use it before I apply my makeup then I can totally tell a difference. I highly reccommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product feels very nice on my skin but doesn't feel like it keeps its moisture for as long as I'd like it too. It does moisturize and feels nice when applied. I do feel like my skin is a littler firmer after I use. I received this product complimentary [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this complimentary from Influenster and actually really like it. It's moisturizing and makes my skin feel great. A little goes a long way and just a few drops is more than enough. Works great in conjunction with the Vitamin C serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this for about 2 weeks now and love how it makes my skin feel. Before trying it, I had doubts as to whether I would see any real results because I don't have many wrinkles. To my surprise, the results were found in how well my skin was hydrated! It usually gets very dry in cold weather but this has helped moisturize better than my usual moisturizer. The dropper and glass bottle are also very nice! I received this product complimentary for test purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product and have been using it for about a month now. I love serums and thank goodness for this one! It leaves my skin super moisturized without looking oily. I would highly recommend it to others! Thank you Loreal!

"I received this product for testing purposes from Influenster. I've been using this product for 4 weeks and can see a difference in my skin. The skin bounces back quickly and lines have become fine. Great product. Make sure to not use too much, you only need a little bit to cover your skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am in love with this serum. I have noticed a huge difference in the clarity of my skin and it seems a bit smoother. This does make my skin feel a tad tight but it's fine once I moisturize. I will definitely continue using this twice a day.

"This really helped moisturize my skin! I'm always pretty leery of skin care products from the drugstore, but this really shocked me at how well it worked! My skin is very acne prone and sensitive and I didn't have any breakouts of reactions to it. In fact, my skin looks clearer than it has in a while! I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this hyluaronic serum for two weeks now and I can tell that my skin has stayed hydrated and suppple. I like that a little goes on a long way and it doesn't have a perfume smell. It's great to wear under makeup as well and with your moisturizer. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I typically enjoy hyaluronic acid in my products but this particular item seemed to make my skin dry, not plump at all. I didn't care for this one and I used it for about three weeks. I would not purchase this product. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I loooove how easily this glides onto my face. It absorbs quickly and sits well under my moisturizer and makeup. I think I've notice a slight difference in the fine lines around my eyes but I've only been using it for about 3 weeks. I love the glass bottle and dropper. It makes it fun and feels kind of fancy!
*I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This did not work for my skin at all! I received it for free from Influnster and used it for a week. My skin is already pretty dry to start and it ended up even drier! I was really excited to try this because I've heard good things about the ingredient but unfortunately had to discontinue use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm in love with the way this makes my skin feel - smooth and hydrated. The texture of the serum is so nice! I can definitely see a difference in the firmness of my skin - especially under my chin which is a problem area for me. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product blew me away.I have tried so many products before and nothing worked. This Hyaluronic Acid is amazing and reduced my under-eye fine lines in LESS THAN ONE WEEK! I am also using the revitalift face wash and night cream. I plan on continuing to invest in this serum based on its astonishing rapid results. Thank you Lâoreal !
"I saw no difference. For the price and ratings, I expected it to at least improve some fine lines, but sadly, it didn't."
"I havent tried the product and I was but after seeing all these rave review were paid for or product was free., I said no way I Dont buy this product no more because I have notice that 85% of the time its not that great"
Thank you so much for making this fragrance free!!!
Thanks to Walmart i have a wonderful face.. I like the way this feels on my face.. request of more wrinkle ingredient.. I like is L'Oreal! Thanks!

"This product absorbs into my skin fast. It doesn't sit on the skin at all. Instead, your skin literally drinks this up. It's not oily or greasy and doesn't leave a weird residue or interfere with putting on your daily makeup. Ive noticed less dry patches on my skin since starting use a few weeks ago and I am enjoying the results. Thanks to Influenster who provided this complimentary product to me so I could share my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm half way into my bottle and I use it 3 times week. I love how hydrated my skin feels the next day. I also apply it to my neck and have noticed a difference there as well.

I used this together with the vitamin c serum and my skin felt so plump and healthy! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Since using this serum I have noticed my skin feels more hydrated and healthier. Will definitely continue using with my daily skincare routine. It comes in a generous sized bottle.

honestly love this line.
"I got this complementary from Influenster for my honest review. I used to stay away from serums as when I did try one it seemed the only thing it did was make me look greasy.. but this one.. I fell in love! It makes my skin so hydrated and radiant, this is definitely part of my skin care routine from now on. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product through influenster and I'm so thankful I did. In my opinion hyaluronic acid is a necessity in any skincare routine. This serum is effective but not at all harmful. I am always nervous when trying new products that my skin will react. My skin is noticeably more hydrated and supple. I noticed a difference in my skin after 3 days of using this day and night!! Love love this product!!

I received this to try out along with the vitamin c serum and these products are a game changer. I use high end products like la mer to drug store products and am so impressed with these products.

After continuous use my skin's texture and complexion has improved for the better. I will continue to use this and probably will repurchase!"

"But not overly impressed. The consistency of this product was a little thicker and stickier than I prefer. I've been using this for a couple weeks and I don't see or feel much of a difference. Perhaps over a longer period, I may begin to see more of a difference."

"I received this product complimentary from Influenster to review about a month ago. I have used L'Oreal before so I anticipated great results form the start.I have fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead and I saw visible results in just under a month. I only used it once a day, and always made sure to rub the product in completely. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been a huge fan of hyaluronic acid for months now and have been recommending it to everyone. I usually search the ingredients for all my skin care products now to see if it contains HA, and I was so gladness i received this complimentary bottle because honestly, who couldn't use a bottle of HA serum as a quick go to pick me up for you skin. I wasn't a fan of the consistency when blended with other serums such as vitamin c but alone is great. Highly recommended! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a sample of this product to try. After using it twice a day for two weeks I began to see my skin looking clear and feeling softer. It feels great when you apply it and it doesn't leave my skin oily. I will definitely purchase when my sample runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

So many hyaluronic products are sticky and difficult to use with other products. This product was the exception. It performed like a high end product. It absorbed well and could be applied with other products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this free from Influenster & I can truly say that it has upped my skincare game! I've always loved L'Oréal products, so using their hyaluronic acid was a no brainer. I began using it a few weeks ago & can already feel my skin more hydrated & supple. I like the fact that the serum is very silky & absorbs quickly into the skin. I apply a few drops, massage it into my face, then continue to my moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product for free to test out from Influenster & really was excited to get it! I've never used a product like this but will probably keep it in my skin care routine now. I saw a noticeable difference in the tone ness of my skin almost immediately. It was very soft on my skin to rub in, no strong odors at all and not oily whatsoever. It absorbs pretty quickly into your skin after so you can keep going with your skincare routine without having to wait long. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Received L'oreals 1.5% Pure Hyaluronix Acid Serum from Influenster for testing purposes. It keeps my skin hydrated and absorbs quickly. It will give you a glow. It will not make you look oily at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This formula is on par with other Hyaluronic Acids I have tried. This is a great moisturizer for combination skin. Super light weight and your skin feels refreshed and smooth after use. I was sent this from Influenster complimentary to try. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes. I had been wanting to try a hyaluronic acid for some time now, when I received this one from Influenster, I was so happy.

I opened up my Influenster's Vox Box and voila! This was inside! I tried it today I so far it does feel like it has made my pores smaller and less visible.

"This free sample didn't really live up to my expectations. I've used quite a few serums and this just kinda sat on my skin and dried like water would. I didn't notice my skin was soft and hydrated, but I use a few products in my skincare routine so I'm not sure if this product did much. I do have sensitive skin and did not have any adverse reactions, so that is a plus. I will not purchase this again. (This was sent for review purposes) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this in an Influenster VoxBox and I can't live without it now! It's soft and smooth and easy to apply! My skin has shown noticeable differences in tone and texture and brightness. My little laugh lines are more subtle and over all my face and skin just feel nicer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product from influenster in exchange for my honest review. I love trying different skin serums and this was no exception. It makes your skin few slightly oily at first but then the product soaks into the skin. I noticed a visible difference in my skin's firmness after one month of use. The price point is great. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have normal to dry skin. Now that the weather is colder I start getting dry patches. I used the hyaluronic serum at night. Love that is fragrance free. It is a little sticky buck absorbs after a few minutes. After a few nights of use I noticed my skin look more supple and moisturized. I got to try this product complimentary for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this from influenster for complimentary product testing. I used it for 3-4 weeks consistently at night and in the morning. I can't say I notice too much difference in minor wrinkles but I have noticed my skin tone appears more even and the brightness to my face overall just looks better! Not greasy and no smell which is great for my skin which can be sensitive at times. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The serum went on well and felt nice on my face. I am sensitive to some facial creams and serums so when I find one that doesn't break me out I'm always happy. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this free for testing from #influenster and really like it. It did leave my skin feeling softer to the touch, and really helped smooth the wrinkles on my neck. It is a gel like texture and a bit sticky feeling, but once it soaks in that passes. Its great for sensitive skin too and didn't break me out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I love a good hyaluronic acid based skin product, this one was a bit light even when used twice a day. The serum seems to work ok, but not as good as something with more kick to it (higher level of active ingredients). However, it is gentle and leaves skin feeling better. I revlcieved this product for free in exchange for this honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product was given to me complimentary of Influenster as a test.

So I recvieved this product for free to test out and I must say I'm enjoying this product. Doesn't have a strong smell and doesn't leave my face feeling oily.

I received this complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. Already a fan of hyaluronic acid products for its plumping qualities and this is a great example of it!

I got this product for testing purposes only. I have been using it for a week now and my skin feels so soft! I can't give a review on how it does with wrinkles because I'm still pretty young but from the expierence I have had so far I would say it does awesome for that. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has a problem with dry skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this as a product to try. I was very excited since it's a drugstore skin care product. Unfortunately it did nothing for me. Beautiful packaging that's practical. It took a few minutes to absorb, so I wouldnt say quick absorbing but it did soak in. My skin felt nice the next morning, but nothing else noted. I tried to use in am but my makeup would not stay on. Used for several weeks and didn't see any improvement. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I can't say enough about this product. My initial interaction with it, I wasn't so excited. It felt sticky to the touch and honestly that's why I couldn't give it a five star rating. After it dries however, I find my skin to feel so soft! I've definitely seen improvements in my skin in the short time I've been using it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this product complimentary for testing and for my honest review. I enjoyed the product itself. I think that it did help to soften and hydrate my skin but I honestly didn't notice any difference in fine lines and wrinkles. I also think this is a popular product that is sold for my much less from other brands so I don't think I would spend this much on a product I could get for much less. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I stopped using this product after 2 weeks because it seemed useless for me. The skin felt dry and the product felt like a mask on my skin. The texture and smell are good however I just don't see any effect from this serum. I received this as a complimentary gift from Influenster and L'Oréal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I felt like this serum did a nice job hydrating. I have oily skin, so I don't need much hydration and this left me feeling refreshed, but not greasy like a traditional moisturizer lotion. I'm not sure my face looked lightyears better, but it felt fantastic. This is such a great serum for the price. I've tried a lot of expensive brands and this held it's own! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recieved this as a complimentary gift from Influenster and L'Oréal. I started using this serum when I got it and I thought it was nice; gave my skin some moisture under my moisturizer. However after using it every day for 2 weeks I didn't feel like I saw much of a difference in my skin. I also didn't like that it left a sticky residue feel on my hands; I had to wash my hands after each use. Overall I don't think I'd purchase this product.

"I received this complimentary from Influenster for my personal review. After using it daily for weeks, I'm blown away with the difference my skin looks.

I received this product free, for testing purposes but all opinions are mine."
"I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes. This serum was just ok compared to drugstore serums. Texture wise it is sticky and not as hydrating as I thought it would be.

It didn't give much results for that. And lines didn't change noticably. I would recommend to somoeone with diff skin type [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"It is a great product, maybe for a different skin type. I just didn't personally prefer it for myself. It is a nice product with great benefits but I wanted more moisture in it and I didn't notice many changes in my skin. I wanted more results with pore minimizing and collagen plumping, youthfulness. It didn't give much results for that. And lines didn't change noticably. I would recommend to somoeone with diff skin type [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Although after 20 days of daily use, in combine to Vit C. I did not see my skin more radiant or less dry.

I've seen significant improvement in the hydration of my skin and my complexion is bright and more youthful somehow. I really like this product and would recommend it. The only thing was getting used to the slight warming feeling when putting it on but other than that 5 stars.
Very lightweight and goes on smoothly. Makes my skin feel hydrated when I apply it but after one month have not noticed major changes in terms of wrinkle reduction. Really like how it goes on though. Received free sample from Influenster! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I recently discovered HA as an ingredient in a moisturizer I stumbled upon. This is the first time I've tried it as a serum and i love it just as much, if not more. I'm obsessed with the “blurring” effect you get from using this. It also plays well with my moisturizer and other serums. If you add just one thing to your beauty routine, choose this.

Although I don't really have wrinkles yet, I'm hoping to stay ahead of that problem by using this product daily starting now.

I was nervous to try this because I have combo skin that is very acne prone. It gets SO dry in patches but oily in others. I thought this would break me out but it doesn't.

I have tried several hyaluronic acid serums and I just don't see the difference. I'm in my 40s so I figured that I would see results in plumping. It's fine as a light serum under my moisturizer.

"Thanks to Influenster and L'Oréal for providing me with this product to review! I have naturally dry skin and I found this product to be very hydrating, without leaving a greasy residue.

I love hyaluronic acid! It is a naturally occurring substance in the body and this product perfectly replenishes the hydration to the skin. The price is fantastic. The product is super light weight but really gives you the hydration you're looking for. Plus a little bit goes a long way. I will definitely be repurchasing this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is surprisingly a decent hyaluronic acid for a drugstore item. It is quite silicone-y and a bit thicker than I like. I don't usually spend a ton of money on a moisturizer, so this is a great option for my oily skin! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product did a great job at amping up my skins moisture without making me greasy or depedent. It was the perfect addition to my routine that I absolutely noticed when I used and didn't feel like I was missing something if I forgot it. It's the perfect addition for plump moisturized skin, especially in the winter! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I honestly really like this serum but unfortunately it burned my skin around my mouth, chin area, and nose. I do have more sensitive skin in the fall/winter time and the areas I didn't have a reaction too the results were amazing and my skin felt and looked hydrated and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a very good serum for it's price point, but if you have dry, flaky skin it may feel a bit too drying on application for you. I found the most success when mixing with either a hydrating serum or my facial oils. I will continue to use it however as I do enjoy how it makes my other products feel on my skin.

"I used this off and on again for about 2 months. It didn't wow me, thus why I didn't use it the entire 2 months. It has a good consistency, no smell, doesn't break me out. But it made my face feel warm after application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I don't feel that this did anything for my skin. I would apply it at night, but it doesn't seem to absorb into my skin or mesh well with my other products because by morning it just felt like a film of oil was sitting on top of my face.

This serum is very lightweight and felt like I had nothing on my face. It's been over a month since I've used this and I've noticed a huge difference in fine lines.

I will contine to use this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I love skincare. I love Hyaluronic Acid and the way it smooths my skin. L'Oréal did a good job with this HA based on the value. It's not the best HA serum available, but it's a great serum if you need one and you're short on cash, just starting out with skincare, or even want one to carry in your purse for quick fixes. I love using it as a quick light alternative to primer under my makeup. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"When I first tried this I wasn't sold, as it leaves your face feeling a little tacky at first. However this odd texture makes it a phenomenal primer for your morning makeup routine. Overall I loved the moisturizing benefits and was pleased with the product. The packaging is also beautiful and it feels like a luxury product. I will likely buy again when I run out. I received this product complimentary for testing and review purposes from an Influenster campaign. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was surprised at how much I loved this product! I received it complimentary from Influenster, and was a bit nervous it would cause breakouts, but I didn't experience that at all. Instead my skin felt so soft and hydrated! I used it for a month and I'm excited to try it as winter intensifies. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was sent this to test for free and I love it! It's the perfect addition to my skincare routine. I did find that I had a little sensitivity when I used it twice a day, every day, so I just reduced it down to once daily. It adds a ton of moisture to my dry and sensitive winter skin and it has helped smooth my skin texture! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes, and was pleasantly surprised by this line. The packaging felt luxurious, and well thought out. The scent was nice, and it didn't irritate my skin at all. This left my skin looking bright and luminous."
I got this item complementary as a trial and it's the first thing I apply every night. I apply a few drops off this and then finish my nightly routing applying the Loreal pure vitamin C from revitalized. Everyone should try it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was so glad to receive this product to test it was truly a miracle in a bottle. I have combination skin that tends to get a bit dry during the transitional fall to winter period and this serum was amazing. It made my skin look and feel so much smoother and plump. I used this serum at night mostly when I felt my skin needed a boost and come Morning my skin looked great. Especially on nights when I didn't get much sleep. Highly recommend.

Influenster sent me this about a month ago to test and I fell in love instantly! I love that it absorbs quickly and instantly gives you a plump feeling. It's been about 3 weeks and I can definitely see a difference in my smile like. They are less visible! Definitely will be purchasing this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I am in love with this product! I've been using it day and night for a couple of weeks now. My skin is super silky smooth. Even with the cold weather where I live my skin hasn't felt rough or dry. I've hardly had to use moisturizer since starting with this product. I'm a fan! I received this product for free for testing purposes, all opinions are my real opinions. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used this product primarily around my eyes, as I tend to be dry there. I also was fearful of putting it on my cheeks where I tend to break out because this isn't oil free. I do wish it was oil free but I enjoyed the product very much and felt it worked well on my eye area. I received this product for complimentary testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am not a serum girl! Never really had/saw the need beyond my regular moisturizer. This serum does seem to brighten my skin up. I use it at night before bed (it is a little too...”bright” to use I'm the day/going out. Makes my face appear to look oily, even though the product is not oily at all. It just doesn't have a matte finish when applying, but I like the way my skin feels from using it. I received this as a free sample to try from Influenster but i would purchase this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for free in exchange for review and I am pleasantly surprised with the changes i am seeing. My skin is looking pump and has not broke me out or caused any skin issues! Will continue to use and purchase once this bottle is gone! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product a month ago just as the weather in my area was changing and so was my skin. My skin instantly absorbed the serum and it prevented my face from getting its usually dry flakey seasonal change. After just a week, I noticed my skin was looking better and my makeup seemed to go in smoother too! I'll definitely continue to use this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this as a free sample to try for my opinion. I've actually only been using this on my neck and lips. It's done pretty well especially for the price point. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the actual dropper and bottle design. It kept falling over if it wasn't screwed on tightly. Either way I'd use it again once my regular serum runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Really been liking this product! I started out using this serum only at night after my Vitamin C, but as it's gotten colder I've begun in the morning and night. It's made my skin feel a lot more hydrated without the creamy feeling of a lotion that can sometimes drive me nuts. A bit pricey for L'Oreal but a really good option at the drugstore for Hyaluronic Acid!! Would recommend. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love his hydrating this is. I've been using it along with the vitamin C serum and feel like my skin is looking more even-toned.

I have been using this product for about a month and it is a great addition to my fall/winter skin care as it adds a nice amount of moisture to my combination skin.

"I am really happy with this product. My skin is super soft from using it twice a day for the last week. I can tell a difference in my skin immediately after each use. It absorbs well and is super hydrating. The only thing is that I am not that into the thick goopy texture, but its just a personal preference. I would prefer a thinner, silkier serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this serum! It makes my skin so hydrated. I have heard Victoria Secret models claim this is the holy grail. I received this product for testing purposes but all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love the silky texture, feels almost like water, glides on my skin and absorbs very well. Keeps my skin hydration on point which is very important especially during these winters months. I do recommend this product, I think it works :) I received this product complimentary from Influenster for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Like most hyaluronic acid serums, this is more viscous and a little sticky than other serums. I used this and the vitamin c in conjunction, so I am not sure which but I found that it seems to pill underneath makeup. Might just need more time to set. I received this complimentary for testing purposes, and although it is a good product I have found similar products for a cheaper price elsewhere. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I stared using this serum about a month ago. My skin has been dull and lacking moisture. This stuff has really helped to boost moisture and cure those dry skin winter blues! I use it once a day at night. I received this product complimentary to try.
I have just gotten into hyaluronic acid less than a year ago and it's a game changer. I like loreal hyaluronic acid because it sinks into the skin and absorbs quickly. It has definitely made my skin more hydrated which was my number one issue. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this item for four weeks along with the Vitamin C serum and I love how my skin feel much more softer and younger. The texture of the serum is not oily and it dries right away so you don't have to worry that it's going to stain your pillow sheets!

"I've been using this product for about a month now, along with the vitamin c concentrate, as a part of my nightly routine, and let me say I'm so impressed. I have combination skin, and as the weather gets cooler my skin doesn't cooperate. This product not only improved the dryness, but also evened out my skin tone and redness! My skin feels brand new. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I can definitely say that ever since I��ve been using this product, my face has been really nice and smooth and also clear. I also noticed when i stopped using it, I had got a couple of pimples, I'm not sure if that's because my skin loves the product or having a reaction ( i honestly don't think so cause i changed up a couple things in my eating habits). Other than that the product is amazing. I did receive this product for free from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product with the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Derm Intensives 10% Pure Vitamin C Serum and I've fallen in love. I have noticed huge changes in the way my skin looks and feels. This skin routine and lessened breakouts and has given my skin a smooth flawless look. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes.
"I am a huge fan of products with hyaluronic acid in them, and this is no exception. The packaging feels heavy and luxe, and I could tell a difference the same day I began using this. It feels like water, but you can feel a slight tackiness when you rub it in, and your skin feels plumper. **I received this complimentary from @influenster in exchange for my honest review. All thoughts are my own.**"
This serum feels so wonderful on my skin. It is smooth and light. The texture itself is quite lovely. It makes my skin feel amazing. My skin has looked significantly healthy in the few weeks I've been using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This stuff is amazing! I use it everyday and have been for a few weeks now and I will continue to use it after it runs out. I use this along with the vitamin c serum, and combined my skin has never look better! My fine lines are gone and my skin just GLOWS now, I don't feel as compelled to wear makeup when I go out. I am definitely going to be using this for the rest of my life. I received this for testing and review purposes from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this item for two weeks along with the Vitamin C serum and I have seen wonderful results with my skin. My face has a softer texture and is not as dry as it use to be.

"I never used a hyaluronic acid at first but was always told i should, so receiving this product was the perfect opportunity for me to try. After using this i can say why havent i done this years ago!!!! The difference in the texture and vibrancy of my skin is so amazing after just the first week. This has become my new staple product in my routine [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I Received this item complementary for review purposes, and I used it twice a day as instructed for a month, and didn't see a difference in the evening out my fine lines or plumping my skin. After two weeks, I started to break out on my jaw line so I started using only once every other day. It did make my skin feel extra soft though, so that's a plus.

This serum feels great and leaves your skin feeling hydrated. It does have a warm sensation but it clearly states this is normal. I got this free to review through Influenster. All my opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"L'Oréal serums are my favorite!! They go on smooth, dry quickly with no residue and this product does just that! Also can noticibly see a difference in my face after three weeks of use. Always a huge plus! I received this product in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. Honestly, it didnt work for my skin. I am a white 26 year old female and it made my skin so oily, even the next day 2 of my friends asked why my skin was so oily. However, I gave it to a coworker to try and she got much better results as a 50 year old African American female. So it worked for her skin type, just not mine [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary from Influenster for review purposes. This is the star of the new L'Oreal skincare line. I love the packaging, love the product and I think it's such a good drugstore find. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I liked the way this product went on. It wasn't sticky or anything. It absorbs right into skin. But I tried putting makeup on over this and had a terrible time with it getting flakey and looking smeary. I have very sensitive skin and using this for a few days broke me out so I stopped. Only used it for a few days so I can't say it made a difference in my skin for the positive. I received this for free as a sample from Influenster in order to review it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've never used a pure hyaluronic acid. After trying this one I could immediately tell the difference. My skin looked and felt more plump. After using it for over a week I noticed an improved elasticity as well. The only con is that it is a bit sticky. I've received this product for free for testing purposes from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"In love! Great price and results were about the same as my last serum, which was almost triple this cost. Absorbs quickly. No funny after-film feeling. No allergies reactions, I have super sensitive skin. I received this complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product complimentary from Influenster but this review is 100% my honest opinion. My skin has never felt softer or more hydrated. I wasn't sure what to expect trying this but I will say I saw results in the first week. My skin is so soft it's amazing. And it doesn't seem to dehydrate throughout the day. I love this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have combination and sensitive skin, it's not especially hydrating comparing to others, and because of the texture, it's on a thicker side, that I feel like it takes a longer time for my skin to absorb, and if someone has dry skin, I think it won't be hydrating enough for them too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This product is super smooth to apply which I really like. There honestly is no smell to it either! My face feels very smooth and soft with it on. I tend to have very dry skin but this left me feeling ready to apply my foundation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this product free in the mail to try and was excited when I got it in. My skin has improved in just a week. My acne has even started to clear up. My overall complexion is so much better. I am super happy with this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved this complimentary for testing purposes. I typically would not purchase this on my own but I'm glad I received it to test! It goes on smooth and feels great.

"I was given this product free of charge to test and review. I have been using this product each morning and evening during my skincare routine, and I have noticed a world of a different in the suppleness and smoothness of my facial skin. I notice instantly that my ""parentheses"" are drastically reduced, and my normally dry skin (hello, Midwest winters!) is smooth and even to the touch. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a complimentary bottle for review purposes. I'm about a week post partum and honestly haven't been great about my skin care lately. I haven't necessarily seen a difference in fine lines (probably a combo of not being consistent and simply not paying attention) but my skin feels great! It doesn't leave my skin feeling sticky like many serums. I actually spilled about 1/3 of my bottle and was soo sad. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product complementary from influenseter and it is something I would definitely buy on my own. Sooo glad I received it because it's not something I'd normally buy but definitely something my skin needed! I was hesitant and thought it would leave my skin looking oily but it didn't. My face feels so soft and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was given this compliments of Influenster to test. It's a great product. I use hyaluronic acid everyday and night and I can tell a difference with the L'Oréal brand. The packaging is very luxurious and sturdy as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for free from Influenster to test. Out of both products that I received, this one is my favorite! It plumps my skin, makes it so much softer, more hydrated and my moisturizer seems to sink furtherinto my skinbecause of it too. Most people don't know that serums engance the effect of other products. There is no strong perfume scent. I have very sensitive skin and this doesn't irritate it one bit. Love it! I will be purchasing!"
"I received this as a complimentary tester from Influenster and I have liked it so far. It was a little harder to apply because of the dropper and how liquidity it is. However once on my face it was easy to smooth in. I have not noticed a significant difference in how my face looks after using for a week, but it does feel soft and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this complimentary from Influenster for my honest review.
This is a nice and lightweight serum! I like it for under my makeup and it has helped with seasonal changes in my skin. I actually used it today because my skin was feeling extra dry and itchy and it seemed to help soothe it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product is so much better than I was expecting. It soaks in to skin really nicely, not leaving the tacky residue you normally have to deal with in products like these AND a little goes a long way. I've also had some scars and dark spots fade since I started using this. My face has never looked better. I received this product for free in exchange for my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I had a hard time getting over the residue from this product. It felt like it took a long time to soak into my naturally oily skin. I think for someone with dryer skin in the winter this would make for a great hydrating serum. I received this product complimentary. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product and have been using it for the past 3 weeks. It feels great when applied to my skin. I may notice a slight difference in my skin appearance but nothing major yet. My skin tone seems a bit brighter. I will continue to use this product for a few more weeks. I received this product as a free promotion to review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This serum was sent to me by influenster. I felt like it was a good serum/moisturizer and made my skin feel more resilient. Not sure if it made improvements in my wrinkles, but I think overall my skin has improved in texture. I have also broken out less with the initiation of this product as well as the Vitamin C. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. I've purchased multiple higher price point hyalulonic acids, and this one at 4x less of the price performed just as well. The product is a great thick texture that glides on smooth. My skin feels and looks more hydrated which is great for the winter."
I received this product for free but my opinions are my own [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I do think this product helps plump and make your skin more elastic. It's weird because it's not a surface kind of moisturizing so it doesn't feel the same as putting a cream or other kind of serum on. Definitely want something additional for the winter months. I received this product complimentary for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I feel like this is a great value. It's pricey, but lasts forever! I'm not sure if it's doing much for my fine lines, but my skin feels better after using and I feel like it's less ‘blah'. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
What a surprise this product is. I've been using it for over 2 weeks now and I can definitely see a difference in my skin. It looks smoother and radiant. I plan to keep using this and would definitely recommend! I received this product free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I'm 27 years old and liked this serum. I don't feel like it's so moisturizing the consistency feels watery. But it does reduce the look of fine lines. I use this every day and night also wear makeup on top. I have acne prone skin and it did not break me out more. I did receive this complementary but did leave an honest review [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The product goes on smooth and is scentless which I think is key for a product that is mainly hyalironic acid. Can't say I've used it enough to notice any differences but with the vitamin c serum it does make my face feel fresh! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Loved this serum. It never dried my skin out and did everything it was meant to. I loved feeling the slight tingle it gave because I knew it was working. I received this item from Influenster to trial it and I would totally get it myself [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product! I just started using hyaluronic acid and I love how it makes my skin feel. It hydrates and isn't too heavy and sticky. I wear this with a moisturizer every morning.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I got this item in an Influenster voxbox. I'm so glad i got to try it, i have seen an improvement in my skin. I actually mix it with another revitalift products twice a day. It absorbs quickly and helps to plump and hydrate my skin to prepare it for the day or sleep. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I have used the product for about a month and really like it so far. The formula took getting used to and I thought it would make my face greasy, but it is actually the opposite! Which is a nice change for my oily skin. I've noticed my breakouts decrease and feel fresher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Amazing! My skin is looking better after only one week! I can't believe how smooth this has made my face and it's great for going under makeup. I can't wait to see the long term results from this VoxBox! I received this product complimentary for review purposes but when I run out, I'll most definitely be buying more. I love that my lines are diminishing and my skin's appearance is brighter and smoother! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I got this product, along with the Vitamin C moisturizer, complimentary - so I could try it out. I was pleasently surprised! My skin absorved this serum super fast, leaving it soft and smooth. I applied as recommended, along with the vitamin c concentrate moisturizer, but my face got extremely oily after a couple of days. Problem fixed after I reduced the use to once a day. Plus a small amount goes a long way! Overall, very good product - would recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product free for testing purposes about 3 weeks ago. Since then I have been using this product twice daily in combination with the vitamin c serum. I have noticed a significant improvement in my skins texture and elasticity while using these products. This product leaves a slight sticky finish but when paired with the serum your skin feels velvety and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This serum is amazing! It makes my skin look so fresh and young. It's trally helped to diminish the look of some of my fine lines. I use it in the evening before bed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Yes! It works!!!!! My only complaint would be that it's just for my face. This gem came in a box from Influenster and at first I was skeptical. Then my trainer said my skin was always glowing and healthy looking. After that my husband said I looked the same age that we met 15 years ago. Thank you!

"Got this one with Complimentary with a influencer and totally loving it, been using it already for few weeks and definitely going to keep it in my skin care regiment, my skin always looks radiant and refreshed after you sing and my skin texture did improve as well [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
In the winter (well all year) I am plagued by dry skin. I have been using this for about a month and have noticed a huge difference in hydration and elasticity. I have been trying some other products as well but I think this product has something to do with it. I also love how it sinks into the skin quickly so I don't have to wait for the next step of skin care or makeup. I received this product feee for review from influenster and L'Oréal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I wasn't expecting this product to work at first but I was pleasantly surprised.

"I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. So far, things are good. My skin Feels very soft and hydrated after using this. It's only been a month or so, so maybe with more time I'll see more results. I'll continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love to try new things and especially if it's good for my routine maintenance. This product is makes my skin glow and don't break my skin but it's very greasy. I tried to use it with different products and it just roll on my face. I'm not sure how I feel about it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've used several different hyaluronic acids and this is one the good ones. Works especially well combined with L'oreals Vitamin C serum. I've noticed more hydration in the skin. My skin is definitely more plump. Very gentle and great for sensitive skin.
I received this from Influenster for testing and reviewing.
"I am 25 years old and I have no idea about how important is to care your skin, and talking about hydration I have heard that hyaluronic acid is necessary to have a smooth and hydrated skin, so when I received this product I was so happy!

I received this product complimentary from Influenster and have fallen in love with it! I use it everyday as part of my regular skin care routine and it's made such a difference.

"I received a full sized bottle of this for review purposes and am SO happy with the results! It feels smooth, not sticky at all, when applied to my skin, and a little goes a long way. I've used it for about a month and have noticed a difference in moisture retention and dewiness to my face and neck. I only gave it 4 stars because I've used other hyaluronic acids with similar texture and results, but this is the best drugstore one I've tried by far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free for testing from Influenster. My only problem with this serum is that I'm not quite sure how big of drops I'm meant to use. Other than that I'm actually a little obsessed. It delivers for sure, my skin is loving life. And it never irritated my very sensitive skin."

This is a great hyaluronic acid serum for custom cocktailing any of your regular skin care routines. If you find your skin get to dry throughout the day or feels oily and spots this will help balance your skins moisture barrier to keep your moisturizer from escaping too quickly. It's thin enough that you can layer in with your other serums and moisturizer. And it's a lot more affordable than other hyaluronic acids on the market right now.

"LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I haven't been using it long, but I can already notice a difference! I have dry/sensitive/acnes prone skin, so most products that I use will treat barely treat my acne, but not my dry skin, and same for products that treat dry skin, but cause my acne to flare. The only issue I have is that it leaves my skin feeling a bit sticky, but it might just be the portion I use. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been trying this for a few weeks now and I am so happy that I have! It doesn't dry my skin out at all but I can tell that it's working. My fine lines are less noticeable and my dark spots are fading. I like to mix it with aloe Vera gel if I think my skin needs extra hydration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This serum is amazing!! So moisturizing and light! I received a bottle to test out but will get another when I run out! It's moisturizing enough to use on its own but light enough to mix with other products when I need a boost. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"This is the second hyaluronic acid serum I've ever used. Acids work great with my sensitive and oily skin, instead of heavy creams. I would say that this one doesn't absorb as fast as the other one I have tried, but this one definitely does the job at a reasonable price. I also really like the packaging. Simple and classy. I wish it was a truly cruelty free brand. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this product for about 2 weeks and have observed visible results. The Hyaluronic Acid Serum does a great job at hydrating and plumping the skin, reducing the visibility of fine lines and giving the skin a smooth look. I do wish the product had less chemical ingredients and more natural ones, but I am glad to see that these new products that have no parabens, mineral oil or synthetic dye or fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love the simplistic design and clear bottle of this product! The serum absorbs quickly into the skin and is also unscented, which I prefer. As I have sensitive skin, I found it a tad bit drying for my skin, but I did notice my skin was a bit more even and smooth."

I already use the Revitalist exfoliating cleanser and love it. So when I received this product I was very excited. My skin is brighter since adding this to my daily routine.

I received a bottle of this complementary through Influenster to try. While I do like this product I find myself needing to use more than the 2 to 3 drops recommended. I have only been using it once a day at night before bed and it seems to be obsorbing into my skin well without leaving an oily feel. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This season it has been harsh on my skin. Heat inside and the freezing cold outside, my skin is going dry and tight. With this serum, i feel hydrated and skin feels refreshed. im glad this was sent to me at this time as it doubles up with my moisturiser to keep my skin feeling refreshed. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been using this for about 4 weeks now. I think it is overpriced for what it is so I wouldn't repurchase. I noticed some slightly plumping of the skin but nothing significant. I have dry skin and didn't notice this doing anything better for my skin than my usual routine. I received this product free from Influenster for review but all opinions are my own [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product for nearly a month now and I have no complaints. The packing is good for dispensing the serum; not messy or anything. The serum has a nice texture and absorbs into the skin nicely. The reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is I'm not sure if it's making any difference in my skin. My skin has been looking nice, but nothing out of the ordinary. I was sent this product for free to review and I'm glad I have it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Omg this product is amazing!! I got it a couple of days ago and I'm half way if you can believe that, is that good! I used it every night and day. My skin looks beautiful and healthier.

"I've been using this & the Revitalift HA serum, applying AM & PM. I notice a difference in my skin's appearance. My complexion looks more even and brighter.

"I've used a 99.97% hyaluronic acid serum before from a Korean brand so I wasn't sure what else was in this product if only1.5% of this one as hyaluronic acid. Ingredients list didn't help me much because I didn't know what the other ingredients were for the most part. It's also fairly pricey imo. Nonetheless, the product did feel hydrating. I couldn't tell if it reduced any fine lines though. I received this complimentary product from Influenster for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like how quickly this product dries on the skin. I would reccomend using at night time and not before makeup application as it causes a weird reaction with foundation. I think this is a great alternative for more expensive serums, but I will probably stick to my Kiehls products. Side note: I did receive this product for reviewin purposes and did not purchase [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I've had this serum for a few weeks. It goes on easily and makes my skin feel pampered.

I really like this product. I actually saw a difference day one. I felt like my skin was plumped instantly and any fine lines were filled in. My makeup went on smoother and I really love the product under moisturizer. It's a little bit sticky ay first but dries down well. There is no fragrance which is nice. It's a high quality product especially for the price! I received this product as a complimentry sample from influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Received this product compliments of Influenster and used it for 2 weeks morning and night as per the instructions. Did not see much of a visible difference but I will say that I can see this product will last a while as just a couple drops are enough. Was hoping this would help clear the lines on my forehead but they are still quite visible. My skin is soft so there were results just not what I was hoping for.

"I love this serum! It contains Hyaluronic acid which is great for dry and dehydrated skin. My skin is dry, especially now that it's winter and this serum, which I've been using for about a month now, has really helped my skin to become more hydrated.

I received this free to try. I think this is a good serum. It seems to do what hyaluronic acids do but for the price I think you can get a cheaper one that probably works the same.

"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes during a time when my skin was dealing with a lot of dryness. The packaging is very luxurious however didn't see much of a difference with the serum. My skin didn't feel hydrated at all after consistent use. I've only had it for a few weeks & maybe I'll see the affects after a few months of use. Considering other hyaluronic serums are at least double the price of this, it's worth a try.

I wanted to start taking better care of my skin in my younger years, and OH MY GOD.

Received this about a month ago and have been using it at least every morning for 2 weeks. I like that it is odorless and clear so it doesn't change my skin tone. The dropper makes it easy to apply to the face or in hands before smoothing in. It does absorb after about 1 minute but I found that it left my skin feeling sticky if I did not immediately put another moisturizer over it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Although I always use moisturizer with hyaluronic acid this was my first time using an HA serum. This has made a huge difference for me in the appearance of my skin.

This has done wonders to resurface my tired dead skin. Having a newborn I'm still dealing with the post pregnancy hormones and everything that goes with that but this has completely restored my glow. Thanks Influenster for letting me try this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"A little goes a long way with this serum. I use about 2 drops for my whole face. I use this step prior to the vitamin C serum from this line. It took me a little over 2 weeks to see results, which is fine because I had stopped my regular routine to give this product a good try. I am satisfied, but still wish the potency levels of the active ingredients were higher for the price. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes, but all opinions are my own.

I received this product from Influenster for my honest opinion. I think that it works well. My skin feels smoother and my skin tone has improved. Fine lines are not as noticeable as before. I would definitely recommend this product.

I used it along with the vitamin c serum and although I have youthful skin, these products did make a difference in small lines in my forehead and making my complexion look brighter. I received this product complementary."
"Perfect! This product went on so smooth I almost didn't realize it was on. I honestly received as a complimentary sample, but purchased within the month of receiving. It is lightweight, smooth, and makes my skin feel immediately hydrated. I'm so grateful for this sample so that I could find this product!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I did receive this product complementary for testing purposes however as soon as I'm done with this bottle I will be purchasing for myself I've had chronic dry skin for the past 3-4 years and this is the first product I have been OK with that price point as well as the results. My skin is soft refreshed recommend 100% [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product free to test through Influenster and have really loved it! I have not tried many L'Oréal skin products before this, so I have been really pleasantly surprised at the quality and value! I have super dry skin, especially in winter, and this serum is such a great first layer of my skincare routine. My skin is better hydrated and looks plumper since I started using. I would highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm automatically afraid of anything with the word “acid” included but this serum is great to my skin! I noticed a difference in smoothness and hydration after only a few days of use! I received this product for free to try from influenster but i will definitely be purchasing when i run out! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I actually love the way this serum feels on my skin. I've been using it every evening for about 3 weeks now. I haven't noticed a huge change but I do love the feel and it has not irritated my skin at all. I will continue to use it in hopes of improvements.

No noticeable difference in my skin. Used this product for 3 weeks. I did not see any changes in plumpness or hydration in my skin. Would not recommend to buy this product. I did receive this product via influenster for free and for testing purposes only. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary for a honest review. I used this for a couple of weeks. I did not notice any changes to my skin, however I also don't have any wrinkles yet. The product is very lightweight and does not feel heavy on my skin. I absolutely love how this feels on my skin! And it does not feel oily. A little goes a long way! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I don't think this product is for me. I didn't see any difference in the way my face looked. Maybe not for everyone but I've sren results for others. Worth a try!

"I received this serum to try from Influenster. Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from the serum. However. I was pleasantly surprised with the much I love it. This serum contains a few sizes of Hyaluronic molecules and doesn't contain any fragrance or known irritants. It's very gentle and hydrates my skin. I add 2 to 3 drops to an essence and pat to absorb. It leaves my skin feeling hydrated and plump. I would repurchase this serum, that's how much I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recieved this product free through Influenster. I used this with the Vitamin C Serum as recommended, twice a day for two weeks. I didn't notice anything significant with my results. My face at first felt nice and refreshed after using the products, after about a week it started to feel a little greasy. My skin is mixed and I've struggled with acne my whole life, this product didn't make me break out more it didn't do much for my skin in that way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been struggling with DRY skin for years and I am extremely please with this serum! The package feels luxurious and the serum has such a nice silky texture. Definitely recommend! My fine lines are gone!
"I received this product complimentary for review purposes, all opinions are of course my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this about a month ago as a free sample and I am SO happy with the product!! After one day I noticed how soft my skin felt and I think it's really helping the texture of my skin. I think it's a great base for my makeup and I'm really look forward to seeing the results of longer use! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary from influenster, and i'm so thankful i did! I currently live in a cold climate and this stuff has worked wonders for keeping my face hydrated and plump. The dropper makes application so easy and the product goes on super smooth and effortlessly. I've seen brands charge double the price for this type of product and i'm sure they don't even compare. I will definitely be making this part of my daily routine! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was actually looking for a facial oil when I received this in the mail, complimentary, from Influenster! So I was so excited to try it because I wasn't sure where to start!

This Derm Intensives 1.5% Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serium is amazing! I received it complimentary for reviewing purposes. I have allergies & sensitive skin...this product did not irritate my skin at all. It dries quickly and I wake up with beautiful glowing skin! I use it in the morning and night.I love applying it before my moisturizer and foundation. I really like the clear glass bottle and that the product it's clear. The dropper is perfect [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I am in love with L'Oréal skincare products right now! This product absorbs quickly into your skin and does not leave a residue. It's lightweight. It really hydrates your skin and makes your skin more supple. The packaging of this product looks super expensive but as far as skincare goes this product is affordable. I love this product and am so happy that I got to try this product from influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've only been using the HA for a few days & I can see immediate results! I suffer from extremely dry skin, and I think I've finally found the magical cure. It makes my skin feel less tight & my face feels baby skin soft now, I have tried other products with hyaluronic acid, but this one is formulated very differently & is a different consistency. I'm thinking this is why I am seeing better results! I received this product complimentary but my opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product free for testing from influenster and loreal Paris. I've been using it for about 2 weeks now and I do feel like it is making my skin hydrated and slightly more plump. The only thing I don't like is that is makes my face feel a little tight after applying it. Once I get my moisturizer on though it softens back up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this complimtary and having been using it diligently for the past three week. I will say after you first apply it it will definitely blue and fade lines/ wrinkles (in combination with the vitamin C serum), however, I have not noticed any texture differences long term. I like this and will continue using it but don't plan to purachse it moving forward. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This serum is lightweight and fast absorbing. I like how it feels when applying. It's not as hydrating as I would have expected on its own but pairs lovely under my moisturizer and makeup. I love using it in conjunction with the revitalift vitamin c serum. I received this product for free to try and review. All opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this complimentary for testing purposes and I must say this product is great! It's been 2 weeks and my skin has cleared up and feels tight and soft. I put this on day and night and before I put on makeup. My pores have gotten smaller and my face just looks overlap more glowy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I use this product with the vitamin c serum and it seems to be working pretty well on my skin! What I'm not too fond of is the texture of this product... it's sticky but a good thing is that the product is super hydrating so I don't mind the stickiness. I received this product free as part of a promotional campaign through influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this complimentary product from Influenster to try. I've been using this in conjunction with the 10% pure vitamin c serum and I've seen a noticeable difference in my skin. I do get Botox on my forehead so I don't have many wrinkles there but I can definitely see results around my crows feet and upper cheeks. I also apply it to my neck. So far I love the results. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I really like this product. I have somewhat senesitive skin, and this product didn't seem to upset to. It's incredibly moisturizing. I accidentally dropped a droplet on my hand and my hand was the smoothest and most moisturized all day. I received this product free courtesy or Influenster's Voxbox program but my views are all my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Received this complimentary through Influenster and seriously my skin has not been so smooth in a long time. I have acne prone skin and along with the revitalift Vitamin C in three weeks I have seen the biggest difference. I love these products and will be repurchasing. I have spent so much money on skincare in the last two years that these two products have given me amazing results! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I haven't used this long enough to tell an extreme difference but I can definitely tell some difference in the puffiness under my eyes being decreased. I will continue to use this product!

I received this product for testing purposes and I am very pleased. I think this product is gentle yet effective. I have been using it daily and see a difference in my skin's appearance.

"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and I'm so happy to have gotten to try this! After about a week of using it my skin has felt so hydrated, and that's saying a lot since it's getting cold where I live!

I received this in an Influenster box for free! It worked great an could tell the difference with in a week! Forehead wrinkles were less prominent. I only used it for a week and found out I was expecting so I stopped as soon as I found out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I have been using it for about 3 weeks and my skin definitely feels more vibrant and plump. I like that Loreal decided to eliminate some harmful ingredients from this line. The texture is nice and the smell is not heavy. Skin feels healthy and hydrated after use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Wasn't really a fan of this. It left my face pretty greasy looking and feeling. I put it on a few times before bed and felt like I was sticking to my pillow all night. It says to use with other Revitalift products but I honestly could never imagine layering it with anything. Just wasn't for me! I received this product as a sample but all reviews are honest and my own opinion.
"I recieved this free through Influenster and have been really loving this. I've used it every day since I got it, and my skin feels very soft. It is a great serum to layer with others, and seems to work great so far! You can't go wrong with Hyaluronic acid. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this in conjunction with the 10% pure vitamin c serum and have found a noticeable difference in my overall skin texture. This serum does a good job tightening up and perfecting the overall consistency of my complexion. I would say this airs on the slightly-too-dry result for me on its own, but when finished off with the vitamin c serum, I have loved the results. I received this product as a complimentary free trial for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Again, I am super impressed with this product. After only a few days of using this, I have noticed a huge difference in my skin. I love that it's fragrance free and absorbs into my skin super fast. Loving the appearance of my heathy looking skin and I have received several compliments, so it must be working well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
My face is feeling so smooooth and soft. Idk if it's the bottle or the applicator but this product just looks fancy! You will feel luxurious and your skin will feel and look better I did get this as a freebie from Influenster but I am a skin care junkie and will continue to buy this!!! I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin has been begging for some hydration with this cold winter already starting and this is exactly what it needed! I pair it with the vitamin c serum its great. Just wait minimum 20-30 before applying make up because it will flake off i noticed. I recieved this complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product for free from Influenster and I really love it. I have oily skin so I only use it at night after my cleanser. This product dries super fast and does not make me feel sticky or greasy! I wake up in the morning and my skin feels plump and hydrated. As we are heading into the cold weather months I know this will be my go-to product to help with dry patches. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I used this product for a few weeks before reviewing. I've seen a definite improvement in my skin's moisture. I like to apply this to my skin at bedtime, then turn on the humidifier so there's plenty of moisture in the air. It glides on the skin beautifully but takes a while to fully absorb into the skin. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.  [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This works as well as more expensive brands! My skin is not as dry.. love it. Especially during the colder seasons, when my skin becomes more parched. It absorbs quickly and did not leave any sort of a residue for me. Do let it dry before putting other products on. I would recommend this. It's a great value for the price. I do love the bottle it comes it. I did receive this product complimentary from influenster for testing purposes but the opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I notice a difference in my skin in a matter of few days. My skin felt pump and soft and smooth. and I only used it once a day. Although they recommended To be used every morning and night, I still had amazing results. I do plan on purchasing this item. I received this item complimentary for testing purposes.

I received this product as a complimentary gift for review from Influenster. I have been using it Morning and evening for about three weeks. I love the way my skin looks and feels! I have a problem with combination skin; it can even bounce back and forth from being oily to super dry. So far has become more even and feels hydrated and smooth. I was so skeptical that this would actually do anything for me but I'm in love with my skin for the first time ever. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This hyaloronic acid serum is heaven sent this winter. My skin is so dry from all the dry heating air and this gives it a much needed boost. I use it in the evenings so I don't worry much about it leaving a residue before applying make-up.

I recieved this product from Influenster and was excited to try it because I love trying new skincare regimens. I've never used a serum like this before so I don't have anything to compare it to but I do like the fact that it penetrates the skin immediately. It doesn't leave a greasy residue and my skin does feel completely hydrated. I don't have many wrinkles yet so I can't comment on that but I do wish the packaging explained the benefits of the product better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"If you are looking for smooth skin to go under make up or just before you go out, this is your product. Right after it goes on your skin feels soft and smooth. I have not noticed a decrease in fine lines or wrinkles, but I feel like you need to be using it for months to notice that. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.

"This serum has been an amazing asset to my skincare routine. The formula is soothing and feels great upon application. My skin has certainly seen improvements with dryness. It's definitely moisturizing, but I have a pretty youthful face, so I can't say it's helped with anti aging. Overall, it's a great serum to add to your collection!

"I was sent this complimentary for review purposes, and I have enjoyed this product. It didn't work well with my day lotion and sunscreen, so I only used it at night.

"I've been using the Vitamin C Serum along with the Hyaluric Acid for a few weeks now. Both have made my skin feel extra soft and brighter. It is recommended that you use this along with the Vitamin C Serum twice a day, however I noticed it made my skin oily. I plan to alternate the products and see if that helps.

I have exfoliated, moisturized, used microdermabrasion, and masks, but nothing seemed to helped. I waited to review this product because I wanted to give it plenty of time to work. I use it morning and night, and it has worked wonders. The dry patches have slowly disappeared and my skin in so soft. I would highly recommend this product. It's amazing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
So I've been using the hyaluronic acid in conjunction with the vitamin c serum for like 3 weeks. The acid it's self is really good quality; it's not greasy and doesn't really have a smell. I can't say for sure if my skin being softer and looking livelier is a direct result of the serum or the acid. When I'm doubt just use both. Lol. I did receive this complimentary as a part of Influenster's L'Oréal campaign [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
It is clear. Texture is not too watery nor too thick. The feeling on my face is not stick but makes my face plump and tight. I wear it day and night on clean face. I have sensitive skin but it didn't make me breake out. Love it...

"I received this product for free for testing purposes. I haven't used hyaluronic acid before, but I really like this product. It's hydrating without making my skin too oily.

I used this as directed along with the Vitamin C serum and after a week my skin started breaking out like crazy...new breakouts daily!

"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes in combination with Revitalift vitamin c product. It wasn't very clear to me the benefits or which order to use. As a woman with extremely sensitive skin, I felt that it left my face tight and dry versus “lifted”. I also feel that it left a greasy after feel, somehow being a mixture of the two worst results- dry and greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

Tip: put this on after the other products because if you do this first it may ball up and peel off with application of other moisturizers. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I recivied this product from Influenster two week ago. Since that time I have been using pure hyaluronic acid serum and I just have to said how awesome is this product so soft. My skin look so different more healthy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love that it doesn't have a scent, it goes on smooth, and doesn't feel greasy. My skin soaked it up and felt moisturized. I like the glass bottle and syringe for the perfect amount needed. I received this product complimentary for testing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"While I received this product complimentary for testing purposes, this review is completely honest. This product was amazing and my skin really did feel hydrated and nice afterwards without leaving any type of oily residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product from Influenster for testing and review purposes. It does not disappoint. I have used other hyaluronic acids in the past but not with the results of this one. My skin feels baby smooth. The product doesn't make me feel oily and absorbs almost immediately into the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
The packaging is very nice and feels more like a luxury brand than L'Oréal. The dropper is a little clunky but that's okay with me. I have been using this immediately after dermaplaming my face and at night before bed. It has improved my skins bounciness and my husband says that it looks like I'm “wearing makeup” aka my skin is just more even since using this. Overall a good product. I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for testing purposes and am so glad I did. A few drops goes a long way in leaving skin feeling hydrated, firm, and smooth. I have very sensitive skin and didn't have any issues with breakouts or anything. Will continue to use it and looking forward to the continued benefits! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received a complimentary sample for my honest feedback. The formula is great and goes on smooth. I used it as a moisturizer under my makeup and my makeup remained smooth all day. No added grease. I did break out a little from using it but it could just be from using new product. I am definitely going to continue because it made my skin look rejuvenated as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes a long with the vitamin c product L'Oreal has. It wasn't very clear to me the benefits of both these products or which in to apply first to your skin. I have sensitive skin and felt like this one was a bit harsh feeling ok my skin. Not a big fan of how my face felt nor how the product felt. It's okay for what it is. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for free for my honest review, and I have been using it in the morning and night for at least a couple of weeks now. I love how just two drops can spread all over my face and neck. The bottle lasts a really long time! My skin feels great and will continue to use it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love hyluronic acid and this one softens my skin well, I tend to mix it with harsher skincare. It's more widely available because it's drugstore which I like, and you don't need a lot for an application so the bottle will last a long time.(ps got this to test out for free from Influenster but that doesn't affect my review) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this for free in my Influenster box last month and i started using it right away! It feels SO silky and has honestly made a difference in my skin. I will definitely be purchasing this once I run out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I definitely thought it would make my skin too oily by the end of the day but it didn't! My skin absorbed this instantly and it's so soft - a lifesaver in the cold weather. I have combo skin with an oily t zone but this surprisingly didn't make it oilier. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes and my honest opinion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Loving how these products are making my skin look and feel! The hyaluronic acid makes my skin feel immediately softer and smoother. Thank you @influenster and @LOrealParisUSA #RevitaliftDermIntensives #complimentary [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I must say this really impressed me. I never tried olay products but wow! This is my new fav brand. A little goes a long way and it's so easy to apply. I got so much compliments on how glowly my skin looks. I did get this from Influenster for testing purposes but that does not affect my thought on this opinion
"I received this product complementary from Influenster. I tried it for almost two weeks and I saw some results, however minor they were. This product was definitely better than using no product at all, but I give it 4 stars because it just doesn't quite compare to my beloved favorite, CeraVe. This did not quite give my skin the moisture I was looking for, but genuinely not a bad product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This stuff works really well! It's made my skin noticeably brighter and softer. I absolutely love it and will have it added to my skincare routine! I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love love this product! Now that it is winter my skin is dry and I look for hydration to add to my skin care routine! This product is it and leaves my face feeling great! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I got this product free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review of it. I like the feeling of this product. It is smooth and soft on my skin. I feel that it does help with wrinkles, but is not quite as good as my current product. I have been using it twice daily for several weeks. However, will not be replacing my current product with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I used the everyday two times a day upon receiving it. I have used other hyaluronic acid serums prior to this one and I think it's great. Definitely compares to others I have used. Worked great with my moisturizers and I think it helped attract moisture to my dry skin. Overall I think it's great and I would definitely purchase on my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product daily for about 3 weeks now. I like that it has a clean, neutral scent and the slightly warm feeling it has when you put it on. It didn't cause any negative reactions to my sensitive skin (such as causing breakouts, leaving my skin feeling greasy - nothing like that.) I wouldn't say that I noticed any difference, though, in reducing wrinkles or any visible benefits. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin type is combination so I tend to stay away from anything hydrating for example serums and moisturizer. But boy oh boy did this product open up another world of skin care for me, it sinks into the skin nice does not leave me feeling oily yet softens my skin texture and my skin has a bounce to it. I noticed that my make up sits better on my skin after using this product and my oil production has gone down a bit, I guess I didn't know it needed more hydration. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product as a complementary testing product and started using right away. I must say I immediately noticed a difference in my skin. I use it in combination with the 10% vitamin C serum and the combo is a big hit with my face. I quickly noticed the lines around my mouth weren't as defined as they used to be in a matter of two weeks. I was surprisingly pleased with this product and I will definitely be purchasing in the future. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"There is a lot of product for the price, which is great. The serum absorbs quickly and definitely helps with dry areas. I have noticed the usual dry skin I get with the changing seasons hasn't happened this year and I think this product has helped with that. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recieved this product complimentary a month ago and I have been trying it ever since. This product gives my skin a slight tingle when applied. I do believe that this product gave me smoother, silky skin. I would recommend this product to anyone without sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've never used a product specifically using hyaluronic acid so I'm pleasantly surprised. Thicker consistancy that takes a minute to absorb into skin but my skin feels soft after use. No noticable scent and I love the dropper to disperse product. I recieved this product complimentary to test and review.
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. I never used this product alone, I used it along with the vitamin C serum so my review is based on the duo. I think the products together are great and seemed to brighten my sign the only problem I had was I seemed more oily throughout the day. I would recommend using the duo at night if you don't want to me oily during the day from using the duo in the AM [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this and the Revitalift Vitamin C Serum for free from Influenster, and I'm so glad I did! My skin is super soft, and seems brighter. At almost 27, I wanted to get started on a preemptive anti-aging routine, and with quality cost-effective products like these, I feel like I can stick with it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Received this product complimentary from Influenster to review and I'm so happy I did. My face is a constant battle for me. After using this product for 2 weeks - my face feels soft and hydrated ! Not sure I notice much of a difference with the fine lines but overall I am happy with this product ! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This cream is the ish! A little goes a long way. It kept my face super moisturized snd smooth throughout the day. St first so was really skeptical about this product as I'm of darker skinned toned. It actually works, my skin is clearing up! I would reccomend this product. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes as the review is my own."
Wow this product is incredible. My usually dry skin felt well hydrated all day without breaking me out. Moreover it felt light on my skin and a little goes a long way. I would highly recommend this to anyone that wants glowing sling during these colder months or generally. Big thumbs up from me :)

"I recieved this product complimentary to try out from Influenster about two weeks ago. I've been using in conjunction with the vitamin c serum. I absolutely love this! I use it directly getting out of the shower or after washing my face while my skin is slightly damp. It has been a game changer with my dry, dehydrated skin. My nose and chin are not flaky and my skin doesn't feel tight anymore. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product to try and review complementary from influenster. This is a great hylauronic acid product. It is super hydrating but sinks in well and doesn't leave skin oily during the day. The size of the product is generous and I love to load it on all the way down my declate.
I've received this product from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. I've given this product a try for about 2 weeks and found that it is comparable to other hyaluronic serums I've tried in the past.

"This oil is everything. I'm naturally super dry during the year but during the winter my skin gets so bad where's it will crack, with this oil I have seen no cracks, no dry patches on my face. Hyaluronic acid holds its water weight within the skin, having this serum on feels like a luxaury spa on my face even with the cold weather. Love this product.

"I've been using this for about a month now in conjunction with the vitamin C serum. I really like the results! My skin is super soft and smooth.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product regularly for the last couple weeks and really can see a youthful change to my skin! I would say the only thing that makes it a bit difficult is the application- it just wants to slide down my face before I can get ge bottle back on the counter. Otherwise, it's a great product! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I haven't seen a major change in my skin but I been using this product on one half of my face to compare and it is a little smoother and has a extra glow. I like that it is unscented but I don't like how it feels tacky upon rubbing the serum in but it can still be worn with makeup. I received this product from Influenster to review. I received this product complimentary for review purposes.
"I received this product from Influenster for free in exchange for my honest review. I love the way it makes my skin feel, however I am not sure I notice too much “improvement” in my fine lines. There may be slight improvement but not enough for anyone other than me to tell."
"This is a super light weight serum that doesn't feel greasy to the touch, it absorbs fast (almost instant). [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I actually gave this product to my mom to see if she notices any improvements to her wrinkles and she loves it! She has been using other products in addition to this so I cant say for certain if it's due to this product. I believe I will purchase it again for my mother since she loves it so much!

This moisturizer claims to tone and it really does. I focused on the problematic spots of my face while also putting it all over my face. It tightened the skin on my under-chin the “double chin” area and helped thinned out my jawline cause I had lost some weight and the skin didn't bounce back there. It also made my total face feel so smooth and moisturized. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I have been using this product for about two weeks now. I honestly cannot tell a difference in my skin. It goes on very light and has not broken me out. I have noticed that my skin has gotten more oily over the time I've been using this. So I am not sure if I'd purchase this. I was given this product free to try for my review.
I received a complimentary of this item and I feel like it makes my skin tight and brand new with very little lines to be shown.

"I have never been too impressed with HA as an ingredient in the past so I was prepared to be underwhelmed when I got this from Influenster. I was wrong - finally, an HA serum that isn't sticky or too runny. I like to use a few drops under my primer in the morning. I also appreciate how heavy and high quality the bottle is, as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I very much enjoyed the soft texture this gave my face. It was easy to apply. However I've read a lot that says applying Hyaluronic Acid topically doesn't actually help wrinkles, it works better as a filler. That being said, it does make my skin soft and helps my makeup look fabulous. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"Like the 10% pure vitamin c, I received this item from influenster a few weeks ago. I Have sensitive skin and try not to use hyaloronic acids on my face. I used it and felt a bit of a tingle, which is usually normal. I didn't notice anything right away but I noticed a little bit of a radiance in the following morning. I have only hsed it once so I have to update my review later on. I do liKe it so far! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"As someone with oily skin it's hard to find hydrating products that aren't too heavy or greasy, but this serum is perfect! It sinks quickly into the skin and doesn't leave a sticky or tacky residue. I find it keeps my skin feeling soft without being too heavy to wear under makeup if I'm using during the day. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes but all opinions expressed are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I got this product through Influenster to try for free, I had never used a serum before so it was interesting how it worked. It did give my skin a slight glow.

"Through Voxbox, tried out the L'Oreal Paris Revitalist Derm Intensives free. I tried the Hyaluronic Acid Serum. It quickly made my skin feel supple like it said it would. I think this does the trick. However, I personally feel other serums I've used before have a more lasting and overall dewy, glowy effect to them... other products for the sane price. For that reason, though it does the trick, I wouldn't be buying this if I had the choice. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I am a big fan of acids and have been using hyaluronic acid for a few years to help hydrate my combo skin, especially in the winter in Buffalo (so cold! So snowy!).

"I tried this product along with the Vitamin C cream after receiving it free in exchange for my honest review. I used it for about two weeks and noticed my skin felt smooth and tight, however after a little while I started to break out, which is very abnormal for me. Im not sure if it's because the product fills in any creases or wrinkles, but I did notice my pores looked a little clogged. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product to try for free and as soon as I run out I will be purchasing more! I have tried several versions of this from other brands. Those don't compare to this one. This is gentle and fragrance free. It doesn't clog up my pores. It makes my skin feel phenomenal! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
My skin felt moisturized but not oily after using this product for only one week. I noticed that my skin has a youthful glow. This product has been added to my daily regimen. I received this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Shocked this stuff works. I use a lot of high end serums and was a bit skeptical over this one. I used this serum at night and woke up with results exactly how this product claimed. My skin appeared more plump and youthful. I definitely would consider this product as a part of my skincare regimen. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I got this free in exchange for a review and I gave it a month to work and I'm so glad I did! This stuff is amazing and it goes over your skin like velvet. It's like my new favorite product now and I also use it as a make up primer because of the blurring effect it has! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Amazing skin care product! Works just as well as my more expensive skin care products, with great results. My skin looks so much better after using for only a week. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This serum is very light and almost watery and great for layering. My skin feels plumper and my dry patches have gone away after about two weeks of use. There isn't a scent or anything and it's so easy to incorporate into my skincare routine, especially with the vitamin c serum. I received this for complimentary testing purposes and genuinely love the product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have dry-normal skin, and this product has helped make my skin so soft and plump! I was sent this product from Influenster and I wasn't sure how well it would work, but I really really like this product! I will totally be repurchasing!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this product in conjunction with the vitamin c serum for about 2 weeks now. I really like the way my skin is looking and feeling.

I received this free for testing purposes and I really like it. I always about whether my skin will be oily or dry when using new products but this make my skin feel moisturized and give me a glowing appearance. Really like it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this serum for about 3 weeks and my skin is very supple and moisturized. I use this after washing and using a toner and OH MY it feel so good. Keep in mind you need to wait a minute or 3 for it to dry down sort of before you use another product to prevent pilling. I receive this product complimentary from #Influenster to review; however this does not change or effect my opinion of the product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product from Influenster to review for free! All opinions are my own. This product is so hydrating! I don't usually have luck with applying oils to my face, but this was different. My skin was hydrated and instantly more supple. I like applying this product the best after a shower, that way all pores are open to suck in all that moisture. I would definitely recommend adding this to your routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product free from Influenster, and I'm always excited to try/review the new products I receive. This product was just okay for me. Though, to be fair, I used it in conjunction with the L'Oréal vitamin C serum which REALLY didn't work well with my skin. Overall I've had other serums that I've liked much better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love the packaging on this bottle. Beautiful. Aside from that this serum is wonderful. I had already implemented Hyaluronic Acid in my skin routine prior to this but this particular is very nice. Sinks into the skin nicely - giving a healthy, plumped and hydrated effect.The price is a little high for drugstore IMO but an excellent product. I received this from Influenster to review and I love the Revitalift line. Their moisturizer is wonderful too. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love this product. I have oily, acne prone skin with scarring and some fine lines. This product leaves my skin feeling very moisturized and smooth. It pumps up my skin and makes it appear smoother. It does feel a little greasy when you initially apply it, but it absorbs very quickly and doesn't stay feeling that way. It also feels very lightweight when applied. I've been using it under makeup like a primer and love the results. I received this product for free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I love this serum. It really improves skin from my experience. I have been using this product for about 3 weeks and love it. It absorbs nicely, goes well under make up, love that L'Oréal skipped the harsh chemicals, and i would compare it to my drunk elephant product that is similar. The packaging is lovely and I love the dropper. I could rave about this product all day. With a toddler and being pregnant, this definitely helped me look more awake and less of a “mombie”. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I absolutely love this serum. I use it every night after washing my skin and before moisturizer. It definitely makes my skin look so much healthier and plumper in the morning.

"I've been using this product for a few weeks now, twice a day. I use it in the morning and at night after cleansing my face. I like the application, it's in a glass bottle with a stopper. I feel like that's more santitary. After using my skin feels really soft and glowy. It works well under my makeup and with my other skincare products. I received this serum complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this serum for about a week, almost two and I gotta say, I'm impressed! I noticed when I would start seeing a pimple, I'd wash my face each night and applied my serum after I'd tone and within a day, that pimple I noticed was coming in, went away! I swear this serum has something to do with it! Especially because of the ingredients! I received this complimentary to try out and I'm so glad I did! I'm definitely going to repurchase!

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am loving this hydraulic acid serum. I've been using it for about a week and am happy to report that it has left my skin feeling so smooth and soft. The serum feels potent and has a tacky feeling when applied, in a good way, like it has more staying power.

I received this complimentary for testing purposes but all opinions are honest. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"myvfirst impression was good when using this. The only thing that I slightly dislike is that the product dries a bit sticky/tacky. It didn't make my skin feel super hydrated, but it helped a little. Overall just not a fan of how it dries. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this along with the vitamin c serium and have seen some difference with my skins and some of my wrinkles under my eye it leave my skin very soft and doesn't leave my face sticky like most products do it's amazing thank you Influenster for the complimentary product to review [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this Hyaluronic Acid Serum from Influenster for my honest review. Hyaluronic in general is an everyday use in my skincare routine that I absolutely will not go without! The serum absorbs well, leaving my face feeling moisturized & bright! This serum & using the vitamin c serum for the past couple of weeks leaves my skin feeling & looking great. Highly recommended! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this free to test and, while I like the way it feels and absorbs into my skin, I didn't notice a dramatic difference in my skin's appearance. Heading into winter, it definitely doesn't have enough moisture for me. (I have combination skin that gets dry in fall/winter.) Not sure I'd purchase this again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this serum through Influenster and have been using it for about a week. I love how it penetrates the skin easily and has no smell. My skin has seemed smoother and less dull than before. Can't wait to see how soft my skin will feel after a month! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product for testing and I'm in love. I use it every morning and night and it really hydrates my skin. After 2 days of using it (with the hyaluronic acid serum) I was actually shocked by how glowy and plump my skin looked. My fine lines are much less apparent, so much so that I've put a hold on getting botox. That stuff actually works!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I received this complimentary product from influenster to review and I will continue to buy! I am terrible a drinking water and one of my big resulting issue is oily skin, this has done miracles for hydrating my skin and evening out my complexion! This should not be a replacement for water intake of course, but it definitely helps with the hydration. I absolutely recommend, I had visual results only a week after use. I use this after the showering or washing my face once a day! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Most serums do not soak into your face and leave it feeling oily and wet for several minutes. Not this product! I really felt it working into my face and it feels wonderful on my skin and leaves it feeling refreshed. I received this product for free from Influenster but will definitely continue using this product. I would recommend it without hesitation to others! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this for a few days now and I love that it's non fragrance because my allergies have been killing me! I like how it applies to the face smoothly without the greasy feel.

"I received this product complementary for testing porpuses, but I have to say due to my dry skin, I can see positive changes happening. I love it just as much as my skin does!!! I would definitely get it again!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm not a huge L'Oréal skincare fan, so I was very skeptical when I received this for testing purposes from Influenster. I have been using it for 2 weeks and, I gotta day, I'm impressed. I have combo skin and this doesn't feel extra heavy on my face and it does add moisture. I do notice that it get more oily by the end of the day, but my skin feels so much more moisturized in the dry areas that I'll deal with that."
"I actually thought this product was going to dry my skin out, but it was actually the complete opposite! I used this product along with the 10% Pure Citamin C Concentrate and my skin has never been softer! I did received this product complimentary for testing purposes. However, once I run out I will definitely be repurchasing!!!"
I really like this serum! I feel like this adds hydration and helps with my acne. It balances the dryness I get from acne products which has helped clear my skin! I don't enjoy the smell but it's not strong. The product helps make up for the smell. I love the texture of this too! It's not too liquidity or too thick. It sinks into the skin well. Would recommend! I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.
"I use this in conjunction with Revitalift 10% Vitamin C Serum since I received them complementary for testing purposes. And honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by how well my skin responded to these products. My skin feels smoother and softer, and the acne I get during my time of the month isn't nearly as bad. My skin just looked happier. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product free from Influenster for my honest opinion. I have used it for about a week and I do not see any difference in my face. I do not have any wrinkles so I cannot tell you if it works or not. The product itself doesn't dry my skin it makes it smoother after applying and sets matte [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this complimentary for testing purposes (thank you Influenster) and I'll have to be honest, I was nervous to give this stuff a try. I've never used anything like this on my face before so I was worried it would be too hydrating and make me oily but it didn't. It feels nice on the face and neck and leaves your skin very soft."
"This has to be one of the best products to add to your routine! I have sensitive skin that can get dry, this has been great! I add this at night as a serum and my skin has been so soft and plump! I love that they offer this alone as it's such a good ingredient. My skin can get cranky with too many ingredients but this has been just fine. My skin is glowing. I received this product free in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product quickly soaks into your skin after applying to give moisture. It goes on super smooth, almost like an oil, but absorbs much quicker. I like to apply moisturizer after it has soaked into my skin. I have also applied this to my lips followed by Vaseline and noticed improvement overnight. I received this product complimentary for influencer and have been using it day and night for the past few weeks. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I like that this does not contain any mineral oils and has been developed with dermatologists, because I have very sensitive skin. It works well, but I really liked the vitamin c serum better. It also irritated my lips a little bit, but again, I have very sensitive skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This serum is easy to apply, the glass bottle is gorgeous and it absorbs super quickly. My moisturizer went on easily afterward. I haven't seen a big difference in my skin yet after two weeks so hopefully something will happen. I received this product for free from Influenster to test and review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received it together with the vitamin C serum as complimentary from Influenster and like both products and think they shall be for sure used together. First the vitamin C warm up, then this acid to soften the skin. I have some breakage and uneven skin that's getting much better already after only two weeks! Surprised by L'oreal!

I received this complimentary serum form influenster. I've tried a few hyluronic serums and this by far is my favorite. It instantly plumps my skins. I also pair with with the revitalift vitamin c serum and cica cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved this for free for a review from Influenster but it's great! I have been obsessed with hyaluronic acid serums for months now and this is one of the best I've tried! I have some high ends ones that didn't work as fast as this. It leaves my skin feeling radiant, supple and very hydrated. It's best used before makeup for a smoother finish to my application. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this from Influenster and hasn't been loving the initial results. My skin feels hydrated and my refine lines are smoothing out. I've been using for a week now and very happy so far. It quickly absorbs in skin and layers great with their Vitamin C serum. Definitely recommend to anyone looking for hydration [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I recieved this product complimentary for testing purposes from Influenster. So far it seems nice enough - great texture, and to absorb fairly easily. I can't really see much of a difference in skin moisture, though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for over a week now and my skin feels and looks amazing. After the first use you immediately see the difference in the skins' texture. It reduced wrinkles and dryness making the skin look plumper. I highly recommend this hyaluronic acid. It's amazing under makeup. I did receive this product from influenster for testing purposes, all opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

This serum makes my skin soft and smooth. Easy to apply and not greasy. You don't need much for it to cover your face so it should last a good while. I'm impressed. Just started using it and am excited to see what my skin will look like in a few weeks! I received this product free from Influenster for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I like this product a lot! It is a lightweight serum that absorbs quickly into my skin and does not leave any residue. Because of this i like using it under makeup. The only reason I gave it 4 out of 5 stars is I still need to use a moisturizer over top of this. I have very dry skin so that probably won't be the case for everyone. I would purchase this product again. I like using it with the vitamin c concentrate. I received this product complimentary for testing purchases.
"It does what it is advertised to do, which is plump and smooth skin. When it says ""quickly absorbs"" they're not lying! I wish it didnt absorb quite as fast. I feel like I need to use more than the recommended 2-3 drops because it disappears so fast."
I received this product for free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I love this product!! The hyaluronic acid is a great before use of my moisturizer! It leaves my skin looking and feeling fresh!

"I received this from Influenster to try for free. I have been using this along with the 10% Vitamin C serum, and between the two products, I like this one better. The texture is very smooth - a little sticky, but fast-absorbing and doesn't feel greasy at all. While I haven't seen a significant difference in how my skin looks, it feels very soft and moisturized. I've only been using it for about 2 weeks, so I may see more results later on. The packaging is also very nice; feels luxurious. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary to test, and was thrilled by the results. I use the product moringa and evening, as instructed. Within a weeks time I was able to notice my skin was softer to touch, and felt more youthful. Love the amount of proct you get because it will last a long time. I use 3 drops per use.

"I've been using this product for a couple of weeks now and I love how my skin feels. It's super moisturizing. One thing I've noticed is that it's acually a bit too heavy for me to use twice a day, so I've only been using it in the mornings instead of twice a day."

I typically use Sunday Riley products so I am amazed at the price point! I did receive this product complimentary from Influenster for review, but the opinion is my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really love the feel of this product. The packaging is simple and feels expensive. The product itself feels amazing on my skin. My skin drinks it right up. And it made my skin feel supple and look healthy instantly in my experience. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

I received this product for free though Influenster. I tried this product for a week before reviewing. The box claim that I would see result in just one day and I didn't believe it. But I did!

I use this every night before I go to bed. It instantly hydrates my face and makes it feel so smooth! It's too hydrating to wear during the day with my oily skin but perfect for night. I received this product free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have tried so many facial serums over the years after becoming a tired mom of 3 small kids. I hate that I am in my early 30s and seeing lines that weren't there a year ago. I love the way this product feels on my face. It's smooth and not oily. It feels so soft and moisturizing and leaves my skin looking fresh and feeling amazing. I absolutely recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This pairs well with the pure vitamin C concentrate. I love the packaging, it made for a mess free application. Using this and the concentrate my skin is smoother and brighter. I used this only before bed because it caused my to become oily through out the day. But I over all love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I really like this Serum moisturizes and strengthens my skin this product I put all my mornings and afternoons 2 drops on my face and together with my other products of Loreal make my skin a radiant and beautiful face thanks for my show definitely these products arrived in An ideal time to my life and face because I really needed it.

"I'm in love with this product! I have super dry skin and it's hard to find a serum that doesn't break me out or make me look greasy. This one doesn't stay sticky or wet looking after applying it, so you can leave your home without looking like a mess. It also sits well under foundation. It doesn't dry into like a gel/flaky texture when you put makeup on over it. I was sent a free bottle of it in a complementary box but I'd definitely buy it again [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I got this in my voxbox from influenster, but my opinion is my own. I really like this product specially combined with the vitamin c serum. I am new to the anti-aging products and these are great starters. I even had a pimple and it is already drying out without me noticing any scars. I will keep using this product as part of my daily routine. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love, love, love hyaluronic acid products. My skin is plumper and smoother and softer after only 4 days of use! Would definitely recommend. I received this product complimentary from Influenster and L'Oreal. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I think this product, along with the Vitamin C serum were the two products that I was missing from my skincare routine. My skin has NEVER felt hydrated in my 30 years of living. I am in love with packaging. I feel extra boujee when I am using this product. Appreciate that this product doesn't make my feel greasy and oily after I use the product and I really feel like it's doojg it purpose. I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This serum is not sticky and not offensively scented. It went on smoothly and dried quickly. Anytime a facial product temporarily hides my fine lines, I notice! My skin is hydrated. I received a complimentary bottle of this and the Vitamin C serum through Influenster for testing purposes and have been using both for about 2 weeks now. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this free from influenster to test and review and I absolutely love it. Been using for about a week now and I can tell a major difference in my skin. Leaves it soft and smooth and feeling and looking younger. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I love it because it gives me nice feeling of hydrated, smooth and soft skin. I like that it almost immediately absorbs into skin and I can follow with sun block. It does not make lighter age spots or freckles. But I think in a long run it nourishes skin and slows the appearance of the wrinkles. I definitely will continue using it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes, from Influenster. I am a little iffy, as to whether or not I would purchase this product in the future.

"I received a sample from Influenster to test but this does not effect my review: The serum has made my skin feel rejuvenated, especially since it's getting colder and my skin is usually dryer/ more sensitive this time of year. 4/5 stars because the stopped doesn't really stop the serum from leaking, I felt like I had to move really fast to get it on my face before it dropped all over everything else.

It helps my skins appearance and texture so much also [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I'm not a huge fan of Hyaluronic Acid serums because they tend to ball up on my skin and under my makeup. This product performs just as well as the other serums I've tried such as The Ordinary's version. I do love the moisturizing aspect of hyaluronic acid but I prefer to use it in a different delivery method like a face cream. I received this product complimentary from Influenster.

"I have always preferred L'Oréal products for my skincare routine. The revitalift line is one of my favorites. Hyaluronic acid is a great addition to my skincare routine.

"This is my second time trying a hyaluronic acid serum and I think I have found one that I actually love. It goes on pretty smooth - you don't need more than one to two drops and it takes a little while to sink in, but once it does, it does not feel oily or sticky. My skin feels so hydrated the next morning, and dare I say I have used it without a moisturizer and I don't think I need one after this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this product for free as part of a promo with Influenster. I am shocked at how great it helps my skin retain moisture!

"I've been using this product a little over a week and my skin has been loving this product. The change of seasons always has a drying effect on my skin, but with this serum it's been adding the hydration my skin needs. It absorbs easily into the skin which is much appreciated. My skin feels and looks plump. I also received this product through Influenster within their L'Oréal voxbox."
"I use a pure hyaluronic acid serum that is hands down the best thing I've ever tried. If I hadn't already found my match here (and at a better price point and more sustainably produced), perhaps I would have enjoyed this product more. Regardless, an HA serum is a great thing to have in your routine and the good ones can really change your skin for the better! I received this product complimentary in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this product free of charge and it really helped me with my post partum recovery and skin care. I started using it daily mostly for moisturizing because I couldn't leave the house with a newborn baby. I noticed results after a week of use and what I like about it is that I can skip a day and still feel great. Long lasting and great quality. The bottle is enough for at least 2 monst of daily use! Love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I'm positive impressed with this L'Oreal Paris Pure Hyaluronic Acid Serum, because after just a couple of days of using it, I can see improvement in my skin. It looks and feel much better, and it just has this healthy appearance that it didn't have before using the serum. I like that this serum is unscented, it gets absorbed very fast by the skin, and it can be worn under the makeup. At first, when applying it, it feels like sticky, but once is dry, my skin feels silky. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
With the cold weather coming in this provides an extra dose of hydration! It absorbs into my skin so well. I've been having trouble finding something that actually works for me. I highly recommend this! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I wasn't sure how I felt about applying ""acid"" to my face but this is almost like drenching your face in water. It is not at all harsh and only takes a few drops in the morning and evening to cover your entire face. I have only used the product for a few days but already think I am seeing results for healthier skin. I received this product complimentary for testing.

It's so moisturizing that I don't need a moisturizer after most days, and really gives a glow to my skin. I've noticed a reduction in my dehydration lines with just a few uses! Amazing! I received this free through Influenster in exchange for my unbiased review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I like the packaging because it makes it SUPER easy to use the right amount of product, but once I get to the bottom of the bottle, it will be hard to get the last few drops.

"This product felt great going on the skin; it was silky and felt like it absorbed quickly. However, towards the end, it got really sticky and I could not rub it in. Compared to other Hyaluronic acids I've used in the past, where I can continue to pat in, this became pretty thick almost. My skin did look more plump afterwards but I couldn't get past the sticky feeling. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
