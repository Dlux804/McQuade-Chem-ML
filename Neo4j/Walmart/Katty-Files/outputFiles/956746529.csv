I first used this product when my husband was ill in the hospital and received this to take home. I developed unusual burning on my back and shoulders. No shampoo or cream relieved it. My doctor gave me steroids and nerve pills with no help. I started using this cream and it relieved the most of my discomfort. I could not find it at stores but ordered from Walmart on line and was delivered right to my door. Thank you
They used this cream on me when I was hospitalized.Whithout going into detail I have to say this is great barrier cream.It also ships really fast.
