My mother used original since I can remember. At 86 she passed away and all people kept saying was she does not look 86 her skin is perfect hardly any wrinkles at all. I miss her terribly but every day I use my original Olay to keep her near. Thank you for still making it! I turn 50 this September and I got to say I don't look 50 :) I'm a true Olay girl just like my beautiful mãe was.
"What a great product... I have been using it for a few weeks and I am starting to see the difference.It is defiantly starting to firm up my face,and moisturizing deep into my skin.Being unscented makes it perfect for me because my eyes tend to be sensitive to fragrances. I can't wait to see what the future results will be."
"I had really bad wrinkles under my eyes and forehead. Nothing I had tried worked including those very expensive professional products. I've been using this cream for a couple months now and what amazing results. Most of my wrinkles have visibly disappeared and I could not be happier. I'm 51 yrs old and am told I look 15 yrs younger all the time, thank you OLAY Regenerist!"
"I have used this product from it's entry into the market. I am 81 years old and always told I look younger. Maybe it's my ballroom dancing, but my secret is my OLAY! Dancer"
I love the way this product made my face feel after I took a shower I would apply to my face and neck
"the moisturizer left my skin feeling amazingly soft, it really unbelievable, i only used the sample but now i want to buy the it. ☺"
"I have a combination oily skin and needed to get started working on my anti-aging skin regime. I started really late, I'm now in my mid-40s. I find this product a little too thick and greasy. I have to switch to a lighter one. When I go get my facials, the therapist says that I have millia and need to change my moisturizer. I was using the regenerist :|"
I absolutely love this product. Been using it for years Thank you
I have very dry skin. I normally use a heavy moisturizer but I wanted to try a facial cream that also helped with anti-aging. I could tell immediately after applying that it was not going to be moisturizing enough for my skin. I tried it for two days both day and night. I went back to my standard Cerave moisturizing cream. For now I will just use the olay at night and apply my moisturizing cream ontop. I don't believe I will be repurchasing.
I have to say that I had to google how to open the Olay Regenerist jar! I read the review below and was happy to see that someone was just as frustrated as I was. Definitely need to go back to the drawing board and figure out different packaging for this product. I have used the Olay regenerist serum for years and decided to switch it up and try this. Excited about the product just wish it were easier to use!
"I used this product a few years ago and recently wanted to try it again after using more expensive brands, but I have bought two jars and haven't been able to get either one open after turning the plastic lid clockwise. I returned them because it was too frustrating to try and open the jars - I would recommend finding a different way of getting the lid off and until then I will not be purchasing it again."
"This is a lovely moisturizer. I use it at night after the Miracle Boost Concentrate, and my skin looks plump and hydrated in the morning. I love the Regenerist products, and use many of them. My only complaint is that they don't have as many anti-aging ingredients in them as they used to. However they still make my skin look younger, so I continue to use them. Would like an amino-pepetide complex i serum or toner type product to be available in this line, containing carnosine, green tea, etc."
"I enjoy learning about skin care products, always looking for the magic fix to my encreasing face wrinkles. Since I am approaching 70, I think I have tried numerous options, but until you actually have wrinkles, you do not know how they will work. I have returned to only one product that makes any real visible difference to my skin: Olay Regenerist micro-sculpting cream fragrance free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product does what it says!!! It makes my face feel soft & I'm happy with it, especially since my skin is very sensitive!!! I've used Olay Products for over 30 yrs. I'm almost 65 yrs old & feel that my use of Olay Products has made all the difference in keeping my skin soft, clean & clear!!! As I'm getting older, I'm needing help with dark spots & wrinkles. They aren't bad & that's why I'm starting to use the Olay Regenerist Line!!!! Thank you so very much!!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I recently purchased this product and I am 65+. I have sensitive skin and have tried many products that cause irritation and have to discontinue using them. This product is gentle on my skin and I can feel and see that it is doing its job. I use it in combination with the fragrance free microsculpting Serum and the two products work well together. My skin feels smooth and has more texture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have used the Regenerist Fragrance Free Micro sculpting crème for at least 5 years. My skin is smooth and hydrated and the crème feels so good at night after washing with Olay's sensitive skin wash. I get tons of compliments on my skin and that is great during the menopausal phase where dry skin creeps in. I ditched the more expensive dept. store crèmes after using this one and getting great results. Can not do without it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I absolutely love this moisturizer! It stays with me all day without ever being heavy. I can feel the moisture in my skin but not the cream on my face. As soon as I apply it, my skin instantly looks better. I have tried many other creams and I always come back to this one. And every time I did, I'd say to myself, ""WHY did you even try somethig else? You should know better by now!"" And I do - I love this Cream and I recommend it highly. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"For the first time in 20 years, I have found a moisturizer I can put on my face that doesn't cause breakouts. As a bonus, it doesn't make my skin look shiny or greasy like other things I have tried. Nothing short of a miracle. I look forward to my first winter without dry skin flakes sticking to my makeup!"
I have been using this moisturizer for a week. It is different. Makes skin feel very soft. It has a dry texture if that is the right way to describe it. As you apply it feels like velvet on your face. Not oily and tacky. Skin feels tight. It does have a glitter in it that makes skins luminous.
Very good moisturizer and face cream. Have used it for several years...
Is exceptional. Results are rather dramatic.
I've use Olay for years. People can't believe I 80 years old. So I really like it
"I LOVE this moisturizer! Thank you so much for taking the fragrance out too - who needs fragrance (extra chemicals) on the face? If you add SPF 30, I won't need a different product for the morning and that would be the best!"
"Finally!! I stopped using the original (heavily-fragranced) Micro-Sculpting Cream because of its scent - whose idea was it to scent it anyway? Now that there's a fragrance-free option, I'm in! I'm a flight attendant so hydration is always an issue. My skin is smooth & well-hydrated. I love the product & encourage others to try it, too. Thank you, Olay, for taking the scent out!"
"I have used this product many times. The past 3 times, jars, its not the same. I stopped using it for 2 months thinking my skin had gotten used to it, but it didn't give me the same results. I am not sure if something has changed, but I was so disappointed!"
"I have been used this product for a long long time and I receive compliments from everybody about my skin. I studied Quemistry and I am always aware what I put on my skin. Olay products are the best, you can see the results and I have a sensitive skin and I'd never have an allergic reaction. I love this cream, has no fragrance and works really good. Thank you Olay"
"I am very pleased with this cream. I have hyper sensitive skin, and this product works well with my skin. There is no burning and redness! Love the feel of my skin after application. I have been using it about a week and I can notice a change in my skin. (I'm 37) It looks more even and smooth. I would buy again. PLUS it's fragrance free!"
"Love the latest formula of this cream. Could see results in one use without absolutely no irritation at all. Tried original formula and did not like so never purchased it again, but latest regenerist formulas are fabulous for brighter, younger looking skin."
"Your OLD formula, PRIOR to the change the start of 2017, was a miracle in a jar, and gave this 40 something the skin and confidence of a 20 year old. But your NEW formula feels terrible on my face, actually accentuates fine lines and wrinkles and circles under my eyes, with absolutely no plumping or smoothing. My skin looked awful after just a couple days. After trusting Olay for so many years I'm so disappointed that I now must find a new line of moisturizer. Please bring back the old formula!"
I love this face cream have been using it for 15 years. Never go to bed at night without using it. Definitely within budget. Buy it every month. Will not use anything else. I get complements on my skin all the time. My husband loves the way my skin feels. Much better then the expensive brands. Need to try more products.
"In today's world you try almost everything to recapture that look of youth...no matter the cost. By some show of luck you fall on ""Reginerist"". You follow the instructions and it's working. A week later it's even better. You don't have to go to Hong Kong to get it, the price is great, and did I mention IT WORKS!"
"I have been using the product for 3 months.I am 48 years old, and I have extremely oily skin, but in the winter, I now get some dry patches.. My skin has even felt more soft and smooth using this, and I have noticed that I have less breakouts now. And I have never had so many compliments about how good my skin looks. I like the fragrance free because sometimes I have a reaction, and I like how it is rich enough to moisturize my oily skin, but not too greasy for me."
"I have been a loyal user of this product for many years, recommending it to friends. However, you have clearly changed the formula and NOT for the better. Undoubtably for the cheaper. It no longer lives up to your claim to feel as rich as more expensive creams. I will be looking for another skincare line."
"I have been using Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for years on the advice of my dermatologist. My friends' reactions say it all, i.e., ""Her skin looks so great she must have had plastic surgery."" This product is rich and luxurious--far better than the high priced ""luxury"" items on the market today. I highly recommend it for any skin type. You will love the results in a very short time.

"I began faithfully using Olay products when I was just 16 years old, I am 52 today and still using Olay. Recently, I changed from Total Effects to Regenerist. It is a little thicker and seems to suit my aging skin. Also, I love that it is available in Fragrance Free since I don't like to smell fragrance on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this the micro-sculpting cream for over 6 months and can see the results of more brightness, vibrancy and added plumpness to my skin. My face feels more soft and my fine lines have decreased. Not only does the product work efficiently, the price is affordable as well. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm in my fifties and still have occasional adult acne breakouts, usually due to trying a new skin product. I put off trying the Regenerist line because I was sure it would trigger a breakout. Recently I decided it was worth risking the $ to try it out and I'm so glad I did! No breakouts, just a rich fragrance-free moisturizer that doesn't irritate my sensitive eyes, either. My undereye area looks better already and it's only been a few weeks. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm almost 75 years old and have a lot of sun damage to my fair skin because of my youthful sunning days. I must have thought I was a French fry using baby oil to get ""the look"". Anyway, I am now paying the consequences with brown spots and wrinkles. I find thatRegenerist micro-sculpting cream while not doing away with all the damage I have inflicted on my face, it has helped amke the lines more smooth.. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love the fragrance free Regenerist Mirco-Sculpting Cream. I use it every day and sometimes even use the serum underneath. I have sensitive skin and this cream is perfect because it is fragrance free and fragrance sometimes irritates my skin. The moisture is good for my dry skin. I think my skin looks younger and fresher. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"There are so many creams and lotions on the market today. I chose Olay because the company has a wonderful reputation for value and creating products that deliver what they claim. Plus, you cant beat the price! I will use Olay microsculpting cream for a long time... [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have tried many products and yet to find one that truly works. I was very pleased with this product seemed to help soften existing wrinkles along with warding off new. There is no magic in any bottle but this one has found a combination that works. My face feels so completely soft and fresh. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After using this product, a plus being it is fragrance free, I have noticed an increased suppleness to my skin. And being 60 years old, I was noticing an increased dryness to my skin. I apply every night to damp skin and in the morning it is still so soft! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love all of the Olay products, but this one seems to be the best for day use. I tried the Luminous, but it was a little strong for my eye area leading to itching and dry eyelids. Switching to fragrance free regenerist has alleviated the dryness and leaves my skin feeling soft and smooth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product with another night time cream, but have definitely seen improvement with eye lines. Have a son getting married this summer and trying to look younger and I think it is helping! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this product and fragrance free is hard to fine in a great product. I have very sensative skin and have to really watch what i use so this product is a good find, my face is smoother and wrinkles seem less noticeable after time. Great product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream provides your skin with a light yet rich and emollient shield. The Cream's effects are almost immediately noticeable, minimizing wrinkles and improving skin's texture. The best moisturizer! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using the I scented Regenerist for over ten years and now that I'm turning 50 this year, I feel it has drastically helped me to keep my skin youthful. Most of my friends of the same age ask me why I don't have the fine lines and even the crows feet that they have and I always tell them it's the Olay Regenerist line that I use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for sometime now. I just turned 69. Most people guess that I am in my 40's even thought I have a daughter who will be 37 this year. In fact my skin looks smoother, with no wrinkles, no crow's feet at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this product for many years. The thing that got me started was the Olay name and it is unscented. I had used another Olay product that was unscented but when this came out, I jumped at and have been very pleased with it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using Olay Rengenerist Fragrance Free for several years. My face is highly sensitive to products with fragrance and this is the only one that doesn't cause a reaction. I use it at night and in the morning my face feels soft but not greasy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Thanks to Oil of OLay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, this 59 year old has the face and décolletage of a 35 year old, as this product has restored firmness to my checks and jawline. Additionally, the small lines that were forming around my neck area have disappeared and the skin under my chin has firmed up. This product is the Michaelangelo of Face Sculpting creams. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I like Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream very much! It is great after cleansing my face. I use it before my moisturizer and makeup. I feel that it lifts and tightens my skin as well as helping to lessen the effect of fine lines on my face. I highly recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I've used this for three or four years and would recommend it highly. It smoothed my skin and reduced wrinkles significantly! I will continue to buy and use until you produce a better product. Colorado dry climate is very hard on the skin."" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is not heavy or sticky .It is smooth and penatrates for a soft look and feel on skin. A relaxing feel never over done in cream . Light as a feather. Waking up and looking great with even skin tone and firmness. Softness, pores are less noticable.( MAKES YOU LOOK RESTED AND ALMOST 10 YEARS YOUNGER.) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I use this every night and believe me when I say if I don't use it for that night. The following morning it's so apparent, my face looks tried and dry. I have been using this product line for over 4 years and the compliments continue, WE (women everywhere) know its the Olay line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Since I found OLAY Regenerist cream, my skin has never been dry. I use it in the morning after washing my face and then again before bed after washing my face. My skin never feels stressed. I can't live without it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Using this product has really helped my skin. I am 78, and since using it for several years now, the difference is observable. Have had several positive comments about my complexion, and feel that this product has been a really big help. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I started using this product a few months ago and recently went to a baby shower. A professional make-up artist I was talking too guessed my age (49) to be around 40!! She said I had great skin. And let me add that I did not start taking care of my skin seriously until about 4 years ago. I only use OLAY and gave up the other Olays for this product, I can't rave enough!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm 64 years old and have been using this product for years. My mother also uses Olay. I love the special product line for older women and our issues. It is reasonably priced, easy to use and I see results. I get compliments from people about how I don't look my age. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am 48 years old. I have tried just about every line of facial cleansers/lotions out there. By far this is the best moisturizer!! I have some breakouts and some crows feet. This minimizes them both. I won't ever change to another product [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"From the first time I used Olay Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Fragrance Free, I saw an improvement in my face skin - the moisture stayed in, required minimal amount and made my skin tighter. I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
just as amazing as the one with the fragrance but I m a guy so i prefer this one over the other. Results are almost instant . I've been using this product for years and I'm sure will keep using it. THE BEST [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"There was a dramatic improvement within a few weeks of using Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I have extremely sensitive skin, so being fragrance free is greatly appreciated by me as it is very difficult to find products without fragrance. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have tried numerous moisturizers and always hated how heavy they felt and how strong they smelled. Purchased this after reading so many good reviews, and I love it. It's so light and soaks in almost immediately, there's NO scent, which I really appreciate, and my skin feels so soft in the morning. I'm an Olay diehard for life now! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Soaks right in! I have always shied away from creams but this was light and airy not greasy at all! My skin tone improved within a week or so of use. Will use sparingly during the summer and a little more during the dry winter! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a fabulous rich, but light-weight moisturizer that tones & firms, giving beautiful results. I have been an OLAY user since I was 24 years old; I am now 58 and I look like 38. Thank you for your products! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using Oil of Olay since I was 18 years old. I began to use Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream to tighten up the sagging skin. Regenerist does that and so much more. Skin looks young, smoothe and not saggy! I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I am always skeptical about product stating it will help aging skin. Olay has some of the best products out there. This makes my face look younger, by that I don't have dry flaky looking skin. It feels soft and moisturized. I have tried many different products, I will be sticking with Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I had been using a more expensive, department store brand, and decided to switch to save money. A friend recommended Olay and decided to try it, and I am so glad I did! My skin looks great (and perhaps better) than it did with the prior brand. I had been concerned about breakouts and redness from changing, but didn't experience any of that! Thank you, Olay for a great product! I am about to purchase again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Best for all skin types i suggest use only Olay and Stay beautiful. I am Impressed with the product price does not matter when it comes to beauty products Olay is the best, Made my skin Look amazing. i just want to suggest Y dont you guys start making beauty bars [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I have been using Regenerist for a couple of years and love the results! I will be 61 yrs old in a couple of months and have been told over and over again that I don't look any older than 50.

"I've tried a lot of different night moisturizers. This one is my favorite! It doesn't go on greasy, has no fragrance and makes my skin feel soft and supple. I wake up every morning with beautiful, renewed skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The texture and absorption qualities of this product are great. I am 75 years old, have used Olay for 40 years--deciding at 30 that it was time to get serious about my complexion. At that time I used the complete face cream with no sunscreen and as happy when they added it. I think the Regenerist micro-sculpting cream, used with the Olay advanced anti-aging cleanser, is great for young and older alike. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Although the micro sculpting cream is thick in appearance, it feels light when applied. The product should be used on the face and neck area on a daily basis to provide a hydrated, smooth texture to the skin. I have used the product for several years and would highly recommend it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Olay Regenerist Micro-sculpting Cream is the BEST under make-up moisturizer. Not only is it gentle on my sensitive skin, it glides easily and nourishes the dry areas to perfection. I have used this cream for a while now, but after the first few days I noticed a tightening to my jaw line and neck area. I am at the point now that I wouldn't start my day without it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product helps make me feel younger and more vitalized, making me look and feel healthy. It benefits in many ways,one such way is that it moisturizes and regenerates shape and volume across my skin. All thanks to you, thank you Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I love all of my Olay products as I use several; however, at night, I truly enjoy my Regenerist Micro Sculpting Fragrance Free. I immediately feel relief from braving the elements throughout the day. I have noticed a drastic improvement as I have been using it for many years. I love that you have fragrance free as I have delicate and sensitive skin. Additionally, I love using the Regenerist Fragrance Free Serum. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Had been using regenerist sculpting cream for years and my skin stayed tight and got asked frequently what face cream I use.I always hear comments about not showing my age .I'm Asian and I thought that it's my ethnic background that helps me stay younger until my family reunion that I realized that it is from religiously daily use of my Olay regenerist sculpting cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I've been using this product for about 2 years now along with the other regenerist products. The cream is lightweight and does not feel heavy under make up. It absorbs quickly and my wrinkles/ fine lines have diminished with constant use. It works great as a daily moisturizer and won't clog pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"After trying multiple creams for my combination skin, this one is one that I have stuck with for years. I have seen a difference in my complexion as well as disappearance of wrinkles. It never leaves my skin greasy, and remains light after application. A must have for everyday wear. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"this cream is not only smooth, creamy and feels great on my skin, but it is also fragrance free. My skin is very sensitive and it makes it difficult to find products that don't cause break-outs or hives. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this product for over a year and I love it! My skin looks and feels so soft and smooth, so much better than it did before!

Love this cream and what it has done for my skin. It feels and looks 10 years younger than my actual age and I also love that it is fragrance free as I do not need fragrance in my facial products. It has made my face so much smoother and softer. Would definitely recommend to any one who wants younger looking skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Olay Regenerist, micro sculpting cream, both scented is my go-to moisturizer for 10 years.. I am 67 years old. Several people have complimented my skin texture for a woman my age. Not only does my face receive this cream, but also my neck. It is my belief that using this on the neck area has forstalled the ""creepiness"" in the neck area [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"What a wonderful product; easy to apply because of silky consistency; non- irritating; wake up to a tighter, firmer, and smoother look. Have used it as day product and loved the luminous appearance it provides; it is the perfect enhancer for older skin [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I am using Olay Regenerist micro scupting cream - fragrance free for 3 years now and my skin feels so soft and smooth. I am 48 years old and i look 10 years younger of my real age because of Olay. I wont go to bed without this beauty product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have just finished my second jar of this product. I have always used a department store brand but decided to try out the Olay line. I guess the reason that I am addicted is because it works without feeling heavy on the face & neck. I can't stand heavy creams. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This product really works, Every morning when I wake up and I had applied the Regenerist Micro Sculpting cream the night before I feel my face to be fresh, younger looking and as if I had rested throughout a 2 week vacation doing nothing! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Have been using this moisturizer for about 5 years, No other moisturizer I tried prior is this good regardless of price. Provides consistent results. I like to use over Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Serum. Both are excellent products. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The best thing I have ever used, amazing results. Everyone asked what I used on my face its so pretty, oly of Olay product. Within one week I saw clearer skin tone. I cannot go a day without my cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I use this product nightly. I have never had anyone tell me I have nice skin but since using this product I have had multiple people pay me that very compliment. I can definitely see and feel a difference in my complexion. I do prefer the fragrance free as the other has MUCH too strong of a fragrance. Too much of a old strong perfume smell. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
These products make my face as smooth and glowing as it did when I was young. It smooths my many wrinkles and gives me more confidence. I love to touch my face and feel the softness and can see the difference when I've not used it as often as I should. My friends notice my smooth skin too and asked me what I use. (I'm 73 1/2 years old too) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I have been using this product ever since it first came out. I have tried others during that time but keep coming back to it. I can see the difference when I stop using it. It is the best for aging skin. It minimizes wrinkles and helps with sagging skin. It is a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Love this use all the time, with the little red bottle first then the jar cream-have them downstairs forgot the names right now. lol That's what happens with age, but my skin looks great, that's a plus for me. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this product for years. I love it. I can put it all over my face, even my eyes and lips. I can tell a real difference in my skin in how it looks and feels. I have even accidentally licked my lips when it is on them and the taste is not offensive at all. Of all the creams I have used, this is my favorite by far. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love this product! It has completely moisturized my skin and helped with the fine lines. I use this in the evening after washing my face and wake up to beautiful skin. I did find it too heavy to use during the day under my makeup though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"All Olay products are superior in every way - i have been an Olay aficionado and consumer for 45 years, and no one believes I am 77. I owe this to my regular Olay use, initially, and then, adding Olay Regenerist to my regimen, most recently, the smooth and silky Fragrance Free, Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream, that must have been created on Olympus and fallen to earth, that we mortals might also enjoy the prolonged glow of youth...

"Regenerist Micro- Sculpting cream Fragrance Free has all of the great benefits of a cream worth hundreds of dollars, with a more affordable price tag! I love that there is no heavy fragrance to irritate my allergies or sensitive skin! Thank you for making one of the few high quality, no fragrance products on the market! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Love this product! Just a dab will soften skin, reduce fine lines/wrinkles, even my skin tone, and just feels great!! My face is hydrated without that heavy cream feeling. Thank you Olay!! I have been a loyal fan since the Regenerist line was initiated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Over the years, I have used quite a few brands of moisturizers .. some of them outrageously expensive and others quite cheap. None of them has even come close to the results I get from Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. It makes my skin soft and supple, makes fine lines less noticeable, and it has never once caused redness or any other problems with my very sensitive skin. It is the perfect moisturizer for me! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I love how great this cream feels when it goes on your skin. It lasts on the skin and feels great. My skin doesn't just soak it up as with other creams. I really feel my skin looks and feels better by using this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"Many years ago I started using this product. After a few years I stopped, thinking 'How good can this be?' Within a couple of weeks I was back and haven't stopped since! I had found out just how good it was. A friend of mine had another beauty regimen and I kept telling her about Regenerist. I finally wore her down, she tried it and she never stopped. I also like the Eye Lifting Serum. Wouldn't be without either one. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used this moisturizer for many years, & I will not use any other! I love the way my face looks & feels! I have tried cheaper ones, but always go back to this one, because of the great results. I once ran out of night cream, & used this one instead! It works great!

"I've been using the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting cream for over 8 years now and I wouldn't use anything else. I'm 55 years old, but Regenerist helps me keep that a secret--not that I mind telling my age. It gives me a reason to attribute my youthful look to Olay. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used Olay for years, but this has to be my favorite product in their line. Due to sensitive skin issues, I like to go fragrance free and this product is still luxurious and works wonders without the burn of fragrance. I am constantly getting comments about how young I look, and I know it is because of Olay Regenerist. The price is low enough that I can use this more than once a day, but I only need to use it in the morning and at bedtime. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have been using this cream for years. My face is so soft and smooth. I am always getting compliments on how good my face looks. My face looks younger than I am. What more can a woman ask for!

I am in my eighties and I have tried many creams and lotions through the years. When I finally found Olay's Micro Sculpting Cream I was amazed how it helped my skin stay clear of wrinkles.

Many times I have been a customer in a bank or store and the clerk has said to me, ""your skin is so beautiful"".

"For years, I used expensive department store brand moisturizers. I was delighted to find Olay Regenerist at a reasonable price. The results are as good if not better than the expensive products I had been using. After using Olay Regenerist for over a year, I received one of the moisturizers I had used previously as a gift. After using it, I could see no difference which increased my appreciation for Olay Regenerist. I like the feel and weight of Olay Regenerist. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

My skin is very sensitive to fragrances and this product did not cause any reaction with my skin. After a few weeks of using this product, my skin was noticeably more youthful. It minimized the lines around my eyes and mouth. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for around 4 years now. It is light to the touch and refreshing to the shin... I'm used to using face creams and I've seen a change to the positive as to my skin texture and wrinkles. At my age I should have many but just minor forehead ones... Olay has been proven to work as it claims, I honestly believe it does. Love this product and won't change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream Fragrance Free is wonderful for my skin. I have a lot of fragrance allergies, so this product works very well with my skin.

"I have been using the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream for years. I have sensitive skin and have to watch what I put on it or it breaks out. I have tried more expensive creams and they don't work as well as the Regenerist Micro-Sculpting Cream. I use it every night before bed. It helps minimize my fine lines, and gives me a soft, smooth surface. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have used many products in my life---but I always come back to Oil of Olay, as I have been using it since I was 14 years old--I used my mother's moisturizer!

Critical part of starting a wrinkle reduction plan. I use it after retinol products and skin just glows in the morning. In winter I use it with the Olay facial scrubs and it helps refuduce the look of wrinkles before makeup. Not too oily or heavy and works well with other products.

"I have used this product since it came on the market, I have introduced friends and total strangers to it, even my 88 year old mother refuses to be without it. I use to use a brand from a major department store and was pleased with it but olay regenerest is the best of the best, I purchase it 2 at a time. By the way I am 61, and get compliments very often on my skin. Love love love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have used Olay since it came in that little ""Pink Bottle"" and was called Oil of Olay!!! Now ""Regenerist"" products are my daily routine. Micro Sculpting Cream, Micro Sculpting Lotion and Serum are on the vanity to remind me that even at my age ""I CAN look good"" and sparkle with a good, daily regiment of Olay."
I have used Regenerist Micro Sculpting Cream for the past 4 years! I absolutely love it. I recently tried the Fragrance Free brand and it worked just as well as the original. I noticed that my skin soaked up the cream and looks radiant! I have tried other creams (2 separate brands) but within the week have went back to Olay. My skin does NOT look as though it has aged in the past four years! Thank You Olay!
"Frangrance free or not, this cream is the BOMB!!!! I even prefer it to the Wrinkle Revolution complex cream. This has reduced my wrinkles and keeps my face feeling hydrated. Just love it! This, in combination with the eye roller, has made me look many years younger than the 43 years that I am. Keep up the good work Olay!!!"
I love this product but the person who re-designed the seal of the jar should be forced to open the jar for every purchaser. Impossible and frustrating to get the jar open. At least add the instructions on how to to open the seal on the box.
"I have been using this product for years. My skin feels amazing and looks great. I have strayed to other products to try, however, I always return to this product as I find it does the best for my skin. I use it both as a day and night cream."
At first I was thinking I don't need that I'm in my early 30's then a second look in the mirror especially when I wake up or have lack of sleep...omg I couldn't believe the results!! I look at least ten years younger!!
"This works amazing for me. Regenerist sculpting creme delivers. People have commented that my face looks more softer and brighter. It feels so soft, but not greasy or heavy. Would most definitely recommend it."
