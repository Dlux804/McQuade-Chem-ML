I started using this cream about a month ago. Cream is much thicker than I usually use. I do like the feel of it after it's been applied. Does not have a fragrance which I like. Will continue to use.
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes.
"I received the Loreal age perfect day cream from Influencer free to review. I thought the cream was very nice, while it was thick, it wasn't heavy. It was slightly greasy and has a noticeable scent, but once the cream settled in my skin felt great. I even started to add the excess to my hands. I didn't notice a big change, but I will continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using L'Oréal Age Perfect Hydration- Nutrition Day Cream a couple of weeks ago .It is perfect for my dry skin .

"L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Honey Day Cream started working almost immediately. It is a paste consistency, and a little bit goes along way.

My makeup goes on so smoothly over it and when I wash my face at night, my skin still feels softer and hydrated. I am 57 years old and using this day cream with the night balm and eye gel is helping me look years younger! I received a free jar for reviewing purposes from Influenster.

"For the past few weeks I've been using the complimentary L'Oréal products I received. The product claims it is for extremely dry skin. I believe it! The consistency reminds me of body butter. It's pretty thick. It's also a bit greasy on my hands, but it absorbs relatively well into my face. I also like it on the back of my hands. It's good for the dry winter, but I think it would be too much for the summer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I wore it under my normal makeup and powder and the product made my face look greasy/oily. I will continue to use it on days I do not wear makeup, it does feel like silk on my face.

"From the moment I opened the jar, I could smell the honey. Wow, I can't even describe how much I love this product. When you apply it feels like your face is in a cocoon of silk. It is not greasy at all and feels so luxurious on your skin. I feel like I have a great smelling protective mask in all day. I did receive this as a free sample to try and I am so glad that I did.

It is thick, creamy and luxurious feeling. My makeup applied effortlessly on top and my face stayed hydrated all day. I gave it three stars because it doesn't have SPF and that's a must for me. It also has a strong fragrance which I didn't care for.L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Honey Day Cream [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received my free Influencer box of L'oreal products and opened them up to try this morning. At first I thought the Honey Day Cream was going to be too thick but soon realized it was so creamy and smooth that I didn't need much to cover my face and neck. I have checked my skin several times today and the smoothness is lasting all day. Love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

This is hands down the best cream I have ever purchased in life. I have been using it for over a week and a half and I can already see the difference in my face. My skin is supple and hydrated and it has given me an added bonus of an amazing glow in combination with the cream cleanser I use in the morning. As a person of colour I can definitely say that there are products within L'oreal's line that are for me and that is a rare find these days.
I bought this cream about a year ago it has changed my skin I love the way it smells I put it on my face on my neck and also on my hand it works very well when you been in the sun all day and your face feels dry and it also works very well on winter when your skin is awful dry I recommend the screen and I will continue buying it on my sisters and my friends I told him about the Cream and now they want to try it and they been trying it on there very happy with that
"I have very dry, older skin and am always looking for something that actually works. I use the serum and night cream both morning and night and have been extremely impressed with the results in one month. An added benefit is the reasonable price ... less than 1/4 the price of my department store brand."
L'Oreal Paris Age Perfect Cell Renewal products are by far the best that I have ever used. The daily Day and Night Creams are truly enhanced by the use of the Golden Serum Treatment. L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal Creams are now part of my daily beauty regiment which is one that I definitely look forward to using twice per day!

"I absolutely love the smell and feel of this night cream. I have been using it along with the Age Perfect Day Cream and Serum and, used together, they have made a huge difference in the look and feel of my skin in the past couple of weeks. My husband says I smell great when i come to bed. This is a luxurious product at a moderate price. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this product complementary from Influenster. I tried the product for one week so far I have seen results so it is a pretty good product. I'm just not too happy with the Way it feels when I put it on my skin it makes my skin feel tight. I do however like the night cream and the honey roller balm [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"My new daytime moisturizer! After only a short time using age perfect hydra nutrition day cream, my skin is the softest it has ever been. So this just replaced my other moisturizer. Velvety soft, rich creamy that melts right it. I also will put on my face and neck and use my rose quartz roller to apply as an added massage treat.

"This day cream moisturizer has made my skin feel soft and less dry feeling. It is a heavier cream but applies smoothly, a small amount is all that is needed. It has a mild pleasant scent that is not noticeable after it has absorbed. I received this from Influenster complimentary for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have to admit i didn't think this was going to be so great. I've tried so many different brands and none up holds like this one. I used this L'Oreal Paris day cream for a week now and to my surprise I can see the difference in my face. My skin feels hydrated and people has noticed this glow in my face. :) I can definitely say this is product is for me.

"This day cream is really nice. It absorbs nicely, leaving no residue. It makes my skin feel soft and supple and left itvwith a subtle glow. I am looking forward to replacing my higher priced face cream with this. I received my full sized product gratis in exchange for writing a review."
I received this product at no cost for testing purposes. I don't generally use skin care products much but i really like how my face feels now. After using this for 2 weeks I would dare to say my skin feels younger to the touch... so soft. I'm going to continue using it. I like it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Sadly, I have found it to be waxy and heavy. I've used the revitalize lift line and have found that to be both light and effective. This particular product was not a homerun for me."
"I bought it a week ago, still waiting to see some changes in my skin, love the smell but i don't like that leaves a little flavor in my lips despite i don't use it in my lips. It's also a thick cream."
"I've trying to find a nice, moisturizing and a age perfect day cream and now I finally found it. It is easy to use and makes your skin so soft. I love it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this as a complimentary sample to use for testing from Influenster. Will definitely continue to use. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this complimentary from Influenster to try. It looks really thick when you first open it, but when applied it melts into the skin leaving a non greasy softness to the skin. I love the feel of it after it's applied. The only reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is that compared to the night balm I feel this leaves less of a silky layer on the skin after it is absorbed almost requiring another application before using make up. But that could just be my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I used the Age Perfect Honey day cream for about a month. While it seemed a little thick at first, it warms up quickly and is absorbed well. I much prefer a lighter lotion in the morning and so this cream was a bit too emollient for me under makeup. I think it would be ideal for dryer skin. I received this product for free in exchange for a review [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I was surprised at how thick this day cream is. I didn't need a lot to get the benefits of smooth skin. I was pleasantly surprised! It is rich and creamy and it made my skin not only feel great but look great too. I was lucky enough to be able to try this in return for my opinion. I would definitely recommend this as a daily moisturizer. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this day cream complimentary from Influensters. I really love how thick and creamy this is. It is easy to apply, non greasy, and absorbs well. My skin stays hydrated all day and into the evening. It has help to decrease my fine lines. I can really feel the healing properties of the honey, and it smells amazing. This is a really great product for those of us who have aging skin and/or if you are someone who needs lots of moisture. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"After using this day moisturizer for about 4 weeks I am noticing positive results. I'll my skin is hydrated, smooth and radiant. The cream absorbs into my skin with no greasy feeling. I however, don't care for products with fragrance. Eventually the scented faded and I was able to get use to it. The packaging was beautiful.

This product has a good smell that isn't over powering and feels luxurious. It's pretty moisturizing and i like the fact that it has honey which is beneficial for the skin.

I cannot live without this cream!! It has a pleasant smell and it does feel a bit thick and heavy but as you start applying it all over your face it absorbs into the skin and leaves it feeling smooth and soft. I feel like it prepares it for your makeup routine. I don't even use a primer before foundation anymore. I will be traveling outside the USA and purchased one to take with me.

"I received a complimentary L'Oreal Day Cream to review. After using it for 10 days I am pleased with the hydration benefits. Since I am over 50 I am picky with the lotions, creams and serums I apply. This cream does a great job without breaking the bank. I would definitely recommend it and repurchase it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This day cream is very hydrating and thick. I was a little disappointed that it contained mineral oil in such a large quantity. It was not very far down the list. For me, this was too thick to wear under my foundation. By the middle of the day, it made my foundation break down. I think for someone with extremely dry skin (and mine is pretty s might work. I did receive this complimentary for the purpose of reviewing."
"This cream is very thick and moisturizing, but not greasy. The texture reminds me of a body butter. It takes a few minutes to fully absorb and then I'm able to apply primer and foundation without any issues. I have combination skin, and this cream moisturizes the dry areas without making my t-zone oilier. It has a light pleasant smell and has not irritated or caused breakouts on my skin. My face looks brighter and smoother too. I received a complimentary jar for review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recieved this cream compliments of #Influenster it is so amazing! I have neglected to care for my skin for sometime and now that I am older I need it more then ever. Once reluctant to put out money on a daytime cream I see this one is well worth it! Left my skin feeling soft, non greasy and has given me results I can see! Thank you L'Oreal and Influenster for giving this Grandma a product I will buy and use for years to come! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This product is a bit too heavy for a day cream; especially in Florida where I live. I do like the product, it does moisturize my skin fairly well; but I think I'm going to look for another daytime moisturizer."
"I received this product for free through Influenster; and aIthough do like the Manuka Honey Night Balm and the Manuka Honey Eye Gel, I will probably use the Manuka Honey Day Cream when the weather has a tendency top be cooler. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great defense against our brutally cold temps of late. It keeps my skin hydrated and prevents peeling after being out in it. It does have some fragrance, which I usually studiously avoid with my sensitive skin, but it's not overly strong and hasn't caused a reaction. I have noted some tiny whiteheads occurring around my mouth and nose after using this. Overall, it works well if I avoid those areas. I received a complimentary jar to test and review.

"I used this in conjunction with the night cream on a daily basis. I first noticed the light, non greasy feeling of this cream. It blended beautifully into my skin so that I could apply make up immediately after I put it on.

I absolutely love the smell! Not overpowering. The consistency was a little thick at first and was a little too oily. I waited a little longer than normal to put my foundation on and that worked. My skin is much softer. I used this in winter so not sure how it will work in the summe. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This is a much thicker cream than I usually use. It hydrated my skin well, but felt like it sat on top of my skin. This would be a good cream for the winter months due to it being so thick and heavy. I received these products complimentary for testing purposes in my reviews.

I've been using this for 21 days. It's Jan so winter months means a dry patch “T” for my face but after 14 days the dry skin has not been as noticeable and the skin feels soft. The cream does have a slight scent to it and takes a little to asorb into the face.l received this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

#Influenster thank you for the sample of this product. After washing my face with micellar water I use the eye product and then use the day cream. I have extremely dry skin and it stopped the flakes in the T-zone and around the outer mouth area. At night the night cream just helped my skin revive itself from all the dryness and pollution of the day. Thank you L'Oreal for an awesome line of products!

I received a complimentary jar of this product for testing purposes and also for my honest opinion. I have to say that I love the cream!! It has a velvety thickness that almost felt like a paste when I was applying it but it left my skin feeling soft and smooth!! I was pleasantly surprised that the softness lasted all day. I don't wear much make-up so I kind of had that smooth glow all day long. Love it!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and here's my honest review. Though it goes on smoothly and smells very nice, it just is a bit too much for my own facial skin.

"I received this complimentary from Influenster. At first glance I thought it would be heavy to use, but I was surprised that it melts into the skin leaving it felt light yet extremely hydrated. It's perfect for my dry days even in the Florida heat, I don't have to worry that it will leave my skin feeling like it's wearing a mask."
I received this product as a complimentary for testing. I have used this product every morning since receiving iit in the mail. I look forward to using evey morning. This day cream has made my face so soft and smooth. It has evened out my dry patches. My husband has even made comments about how soft and younger looking my skin has become! This day cream has become my new favorite! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I started using this approx3 weeks ago (I received thru Influenster) and my skin is glowing, dewy and appears firmer. My small lines and wrinkles have plumped. I would recommend this for anyone with mature skin. I love it! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I have just the skin for this product line, very dry and suddenly looking my age. The first thing I noticed is how amazing it smells, not a heavy scent though! My skin seems to be responding; only been a few days but it does seem softer and less dry already. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a good day cream, the only thing is it felt a little tacky on my skin...maybe I used too much??? It felt like my makeup didn't apply correctly after using the day cream."

Received this product from @Influenster as a #Complimentary #VoxBox for a #review. I have been using this product for 20 days and it is a game changer and my skin looks and feels refreshed #Loreal #AgePerfectHydraNutritionHoneyDayCream. #WhoSaysBeingOver50IsntGlamorous❣️ [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was given a complimentary sample of the age perfect honey day cream to try out. I really liked it but it made my face so hot that all I did was sweat so therefore I could put no make up on. Other than that which is kind of a big issue if you have to wear make up it made my fence skin feel great! I Would definitely recommend it to someone who does not wear make up. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a complimentary item to sample and review. The scent is plesant and not over-whelming at all. It is somewhat thick in consistency but does soak into the skin to moisturize quickly. I have worn it both under makeup and without make-up. When wearing with makeup it seems to help my foundation go on more smoothly. Without makeup it makes my skin feel more fresh and supple after applying. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using the Loreal Day Cream for a little over a week and enjoy the way it feels and smells! At my age it is not easy to find the right day cream but this one is specific for ""mature"" skin. It is easy to apply (creamy) and works well under my makeup. I have noticed that my skin is softer and more firm. I received these products complimentary from Influenster for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using an expensive face cream trying to help with my “aging” skin. The Honey Day Cream is so soft and smooth! I was concerned because I recently started breaking out in my face and worries this may make it worst. It didn't, my skin feels soft and smooth. I love this and would recommend to anyone looking for a day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as part of a box box promotion, I'm pretty tough on reviewing products but this one passed the test! It's thick and rich, smells yummy in a very subtle way. It went on smooth and was not greasy at all. My face felt firm and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I got this product to try free from Influenster. I love love the smell of this product as it has a light smell not overwhelming. You only need a little to go a long way and it blends into my skin really easy without a greasy finish. Makeup easily goes over this product with no issues. The only bad thing is don't get it to close to your eyes as it burns bad. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product to test from Influenster. I used it to look younger and decrease lines. It worked better than I thought. This product was awesome. It does everything it says. Will buy regularaly. Thank you for a great product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. I'm obsessed with this product! My skin tend to be dry and my make-up does not always respond well to other face cream but this one is so hydrating and my make-up goes on so soft and smooth and I feel like I have a fresh look all day and my skin feels amazing and hydrated. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I used this product for 3 weeks and did not see a lot of change in my skin. I found the cream to be tick and did not absorb easily. I will agree it moisturizes all day but it also leaves you feeling greasy and for me it was clogging my pores. I received this product complementary for testing from #influenster [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received a sample of this to review. I was a little afraid it might be too rich for my skin, but it felt great under my makeup and by itself. This is especially helpful in the winter when my skin really gets dry."
It makes my skin soft and seems to plump up the fine lines. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
This product is wonderful. I can see and feel a difference in my skin on my face and my neck. My skin feels supple and has a glow. I can see my fine lines dissappear. A little bit goes a long way. Wonderful cream. Highly recommend. I received this complimentary product for testing from Influenster. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was sent this through Influenster to use and review. A nice day cream for aging skin. I use it on top of a face serum. It helps keep my skin stay hydrated all day. I noticed this evening when I was stressed and rubbed my face like you are not supposed to! My face still felt so smooth and soft and hydrated, It was a pleasant feeling after having a very rough day. :) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've been using this for several weeks now, and I've really enjoyed how soft my skin feels. I was having trouble with dry, flaky areas on my face, but no more. I���ve been using this day cream in conjunction with the night cream and eye roller ball and I'm so happy with the way my skin feels as opposed to how it felt before I used this. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I have been using this day cream for over 2 weeks and I love it! The cream provides my mature and very dry skin with moisturization and hydration that lasts all day.

I've used L'Oreal moisturizers before. This is the first time I have used this one. It has a fresh scent. Goes on rich but light. I like the way it makes my face feel moisturized without the greasy feel. I have not experienced any breakouts from using this. My skin is super sensitive so that is really important to me.
I received this item complimentary from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I Love this product! It is not too heavy for day use and feels so smooth and rich when putting it on. My face was visably better without makeup after using this only one week! I received this product free from Influenster to try and will definitely purchase again! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Honey Day Cream complimentary of Loreal in a Influenster Vox Box. The face cream is very smooth, easy to apply. However, it leaves your skin sticky, and foundation or powder does not apply well over it. On makeup free days its a great product for your skin. I do recommend this product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes. First of all, the jar is a generous size and the product smells amazing. Its very creamy and works into my skin very nicely. I'm sharing it with my husband because his skin is drier than my skin. We both like it. Two thumbs up! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

I received this product from Influenster in exchange for an honest review. I love the way this cream smells. It also leaves a glow on my skin. I wish it was a bit less greasy and easier to spread in the face. I would recommend for winter weather for extra moisture. I'm not sure my face can handle it in the summer as it already broke me out a little. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Have been using L'Oreal Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Honey Day Cream for the past two weeks as part of my daily make-up routine.

"I LOVE the Night Cream. As a matter of fact , it works so well, I think I can use something lighter during the day. But if you need intense moisturizer then this would be good for you. Unlike other creams, it does not have a strong fragrance, so thats a plus. I did receive this product in exchange for an honest review [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this from influenster to review a few weeks ago. At first I thought the cream was super heavy but after a day or so, I realized that it was because I was using the same amount as I had with my old day cream! This has such a wonderful rich and buttery texture, a little goes a long way. I can honestly say there is a visible softness and glow to my skin after using it just these few weeks! I LOVE this day cream! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this complimentary from Influenster's for review purposes and like the day cream much better than the night cream. I went a bit lighter on the cream and it kept very nicely during the day. This cream is rich but just use a tiny bit and it will go along way. Smell is nice and great texture [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This day cream is the perfect complement to the night cream from the same line. My husband has been using this product, and he has been very pleased with the results. The day cream leaves his skin soft and smooth, and it's not at all heavy or sticky. We received this product from Influenster for testing."
I recieved this complimentary to test and loved it! I have very dry skin on my t zone and have tried numerous products. Nothing seemed to work very well. This has worked wonderfully. It is thicker than most things I've used but absorbs quickly. My skin hasn't felt this soft in a long time. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product from Influencer for testing. While I usually like L'Oreal creams, this one was a disappointment. It's too heavy and dense, hard to apply. There is no way I can use it for day time. It make my face oily and shiny. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Honey Day Cream is going to be a part of my morning routine from now on. It's a refreshing way to start my morning. Glides on easily, isn't sticky or greasy and smells fabulous! My skin loves and and I see and feel a difference! I received this product for free to try out and so very happy I did!

I've been using this for 2 weeks. This is a thick cream so a little goes a long way. My face feels very smooth and soft. I have dry patches on each jaw and it has really helped smooth them. I haven't seen any change in the fine lines around my mouth but I've only been using it for 2 weeks. I received this product complimentary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this in a complimentary Influenster box. I started using it about two weeks ag. At first I didn't think I would care for it due to feeling heavy as I applied it to my face. The heaviness goes away instantly, and my face is super smooth. Only wish it had sunscreen in it. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I'm glad I had the opportunity to try this product and write a review. I have been using it over for a week now. I'm still in the immediate results of the product. I like how my skin feels and looks. This product is very thick and very creamy. It has a nice scent that goes away as the product sets on my skin. I use it under my make up. It looks fine, but my skin feels heavy and sticky all day. I received this product complimentary from Influenster for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Very creamy product that leaves my face feeling hydrated all day. I have a glow with no shine. Has a light pleasant warm honey scent. I liked it very much.

Since I've been using this Day Cream I have noticed a huge difference in my skin texture. I've had a dry patch on my cheek for years and the L'Oréal Age perfect Hydra Honey day Cream has fixed that.

"I received a complimentary sample from Influenster. I like the way it smells and the way it feels on the skin, although a bit too greasy if I were to use it on warm weather. As it is, its great for winter. The consistency is a bit firm so it takes a bit of work to spread it on the skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a complimentary sample from Influenster and I'm so glad I did. This is a thicker moisturizer. It really seeps into the skin.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This cream didn't appear to be very long lasting to me, and I didn't like how my makeup went on over it. It's not terrible, there are just others I prefer more. It does have a nice smell."

Here is what I like about this cream: it has a lovely texture. It is not greasy nor is it matte. I don't notice a scent and it doesn't pull under my makeup.

I've used Loreal products in the past and have to say this is my new favorite! It's thick and creamy so you do not need a lot. I live in Arizona so I needed something that would hydrate my skin.

I received this product for my honest opinion and will be buying this as part of my daily regimen [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

First thing I noticed is the strong flowery scent. The next thing is this is very thick. Although it's moisturizing it's just too much under makeup. It melted my makeup within hours. If your not wearing makeup you'd be ok I think if you can get past the scent. I received this as a complimentary product for my review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product as a free gift. But I have been using it every day because I'm looking for something new for my skin. This is light and lovely and has a wonderful fragrance ever so slight. It keeps my face feeling fresh and dewy but not greasy. I only wish it had an SPF added to it and it would be darn near perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received the L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Honey Day Cream free to test & review. I like the thick consistency, however, it was not easily absorbed into my skin. It actually felt drying and hard to move around on my face and neck. The scent is light & not overwhelming. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I recieved this complimentary from Influenster and am reviewing it. When I first started using this ,I was impressed with how thick it was. At first I didn't think it moisturized my skin very well, but as I continue to use it in our harsh winter I can feel the deep moisturization that is happening.I am really happy with the product and will continue to use and get superior moisture deep into my skin. Thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this through Influenster for my evaluation. The positives: it is very moisturizing and feels wonderful on my skin. The big negative is that foundation only lasted a few hours before it started sliding around. After 4 hours it looked horrible. I will save this for no-makeup days. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"At first, I was kinda worried about how it would feel putting the cream on my face since it has Manuka Honey in it. Love the texture of the cream and how it makes my face feel while putting it on and afterward. Will definitely keep using it. I received this product complimentary to try at home. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I started using this product a few days ago and I am already hooked- the way my facial skin feels after applying is awesome! No greasy feel -no sticky-just soft skin- wonderful scent too- this is a great product! Thank you #influenster at this free to try product! I love it [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and to review for Influenster.I have used it every morning for a week so far, and my skin looks firmer and feels soft and smooth. You only need to aply a small amount. It goes on very easily, and absorbs into my skin very quickly. It also has a pleasant scent. I will definitely buy another jar after this one runs out. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this complementary for my review.This is a great daytime face cream.I love that it leaves no greasy residue on my skin.My makeup look great even after a 12 hour day.Has real y helped with the winter dryness of my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I have been using this product along with the night balm & the honey eye gel & I feel like my face looks much healthier, younger & smoother. I have always loved L'Oreal products & will be using these more in the future! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Absolutely love my complimentary day cream from @influenster. So light and creamy. Does not leave my skin feeling greasy. I will be using this for many years to come. I received this product complimentary for review purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Very impressed with this day cream which I received as a complimentary sample to review. I have tried many different moisturizers from the very expensive to the not so expensive. Right from the first time I tried it, I loved how this cream absorbed into my skin yet made my skin feel soft and moisturized all day under my foundation. It is not greasy and smells great. I was definitely impressed and will continue to use it to see if it continues to improve my skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Day Cream for a week now and can honestly say that my skin is showing improvement in skin tone and fine lines. One of my close friends ask if I had switched foundations and I told her I wasn't wearing makeup at the time. With that being said I plan to continue using this complementary product that I received free for testing purposes. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"This day cream is a thick consistency and feels like it sits on top of my skin,even when using a small amount which is all you need. It feels and looks greasy all day and for me is a disaster under makeup. Foundation and brow pomade that normally won't budge just slid right off of my face. The scent isn't bad and not overwhelming. For me this is ok if I'm not wearing makeup but otherwise no. I received this product for free from Influenster in exchange for my honest review. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Sampled this product through Influenster. I had been using another product, that I was satisfied with, but this one is different, and better! It absorbs quickly, and my skin without make-up feels smooth and comfortable. However, after applying make-up, the moisturizer seems to create a dewy look. I found that my make-up went on more smoothly, and my skin felt great, even at the end of the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"This is a great daily moisturizer that does not leave your skin feeling greasy and has a very light, pleasant fragrance that does not linger. I'm able to use it every day on my normal, slightly-dry aging skin with no issues at all."
I received a complimentary product for testing purposes. All opinions are my own. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product to try and review compliments of Influenster. I usually stay away from L'oreal products because I always thought they were too heavily fragranced. I am so glad I tried this day cream. Its perfect. My skill n feels like silk and my makeup applies perfectly. This truly is a great day cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this L'Oréal Age Perfect Honey Day Cream complimentary for an honest review. Creamy but not too thick, greasy or heavy. Used on my face and neck as well. My skin feels noticeably smoother and less dry. This when paired with the same formula night balm is amazing for ageing skin. Very hydrating. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a complimentary jar to try and I loved it. My skin felt smoother, sister and refreshed. It is very luxurious and creamy and smells great like you are in a spa! It comes in a good size had and doesn't take a whole lot so it will last. I will definitely consider purchasing more and it absolutely lives up to the L'OREAL reputation. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this product complimentary for testing purposes and to review for Influenster. When the product is first applied, it feels heavy and stiff when being massaged, if you will, into your face; however, throughout the day my skin felt smooth and soft, not heavy as I expected it to. I don't wear makeup, so my skin felt light and airy throughout the day. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I was sent this product complimentary for testing. This cream, almost a balm, is very moisturizing, yet lighter than the night cream. It sinks into your skin almost immediately and keeps it moisturized throughout the day. It has a light fragrance that smells nice and is not overpowering. Loreal did a great job on this skincare line. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this as a complimentary product for my review. Overall, this is a very nice cream: easy to apply, hydrating, and makes skin glow. For me, it was too creamy and heavy for a day cream and made my skin oily. But if you have very dry skin, I think this would be perfect. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I've used this product for over a week now daily and I find it to be just a little heavy for my liking. Under makeup, it seemed to cause my foundation to break up a bit and I got super shiny very quickly. I received this product for free to review so I will continue using for the next month or so to see if my skin just needs to adjust to it."
"I have been using this for a week now. I have good skin for a 55-year old because I have always taken care of it, but aging is a constant battle. This cream really adds moisture while also tightening my saggy neck skin. I will be buying this regularly. I was sent a free trial product for testing/review.) [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received this cream complimentary for review purposes. This cream has a scent - not a bad scent - but I don't enjoy face creams that have a scent. Also, the scent lingers and I couldn't get past that. The honey night cream has a much lighter scent (almost unscented) and I liked that one much better. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this in a vox box from
Influenster. I was hesitant in trying this as I have oily skin. I have to say it does not make my face any oilier. It's makes my skin soft and my coverup make up goes on easier. This was a complementary testing [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this complimentary product from Influenster for my honest review and love it! It is so easy and soothing to apply and noticed a difference immediately. Very moisturizing, reduced the appearance of fine lines, and noticeably brightened my skin. I was skeptical to use it because I have very sensitive skin and have adverse reactions to many products but this did not irritate my skin at all! Very pleased with this product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"The texture of this cream is thick and silky but it has a definite scent. It's not an unpleasant scent, but I prefer my face creams to be unscented or at least I would want the scent to fade quickly. This scent lasts. I received this cream complimentary for review purposes [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received products to review from Influenster. This is my honest review after using the day cream for about one week. First I like the light texture which absorbs nicely into the skin to allow easy makeup application. It makes my skun smooth. I am 57 and do not have many wrinkles. The only thing I do not like much is the fragrance but I could move past that. This is an effective moisturizer for mature skin and I would recommend it. No SPF though. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this as a sample and I love it! I can tell a difference in my skin. The formula is soft on the skin and the fragrance is pleasing. My skin is dry with fine lines. My face look and feels hydrated and the lines and wrinkles are reducing. Thank you for a wonderful product. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this as a complimentary testing product. It smells and feels nice, non irritating to my sensitive skin. I noticed a marked difference in my skin as far as helping with dryness. I wouldn't use instead of my current products, but I will use in the winter months as an addition."
"The L'Oréal Paris Age Perfect Hydra Nutrition Honey Day Cream is heavenly! It makes my skin feel soft and luxurious. It's very easy to apply and a little goes a long way. It smells great, too! I received this product complimentary for testing and I am truly a fan. I will be purchasing this product to add to my daily skincare regimen. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"My skin is sensitive and therefore, I am a bit choosy about the types of moisturizer I use on my skin. When I received this product for testing and review I was amazed at how it my skin feel soft and dewy. I wore it under makeup and it did not make my skin feel uncomfortable at all. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have only been using this for a few days but the look of my skin is wonderful! This has diminished my fine lines and my skin is so soft!! I will be 56 in January and this has made me look so much younger! I recieved this complimentary from Influenster!! I hit the jackpot!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I can't believe after all the years and money I've spent, trying to get the results I've gotten after only one days use with Age Perfect Hydra- Nutrition Honey Day Cream!!! My skin really does feel better! More nourished, soft and radiant. I received this product free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."
"I received this free through Influenster to try. I replaced a far more expensive moisturizer in my routine and was very pleased. This has a creamy smooth texture, not too thick or thin. My skin absorbed it perfectly to apply foundation over it and look good. It has a pleasant, but somewhat perfume smell at first, that I do not care for, but it disipates quickly and is not a deal breaker. This moisturizer leaves the skin feeling hydrated and the skin glowing. I highly recommend! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"Super rich, buttery cream that keeps the skin moisturized during the day. It might border on being too rich if you tend to have oily skin. I Love it, but I love heavier cream. I received this product complementary for testing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I received a free container of the Loreal Age Perfect Hydra Nutition Honey Day Cream for review, and I am genuinely pleased with the product. Overall, I find it to be lightweight, non-greasy, and it makes my skin feel very soft. My only complaint would be the scent. It smells a bit like a weird honey, but it's faint enough to where I can live with it. For the price, this is a great & effective item. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I received this moisturizer as a free demo from Influenster. I was really hoping that I would like it and use it daily. For me it is just too thick to use during the day. Even hours after applying it I can still feel it on my skin. It does moisturize. I am just not comfortable feeling it so much. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I received this iny voxbox from influenster & am quite pleased!! At first I was a bit skeptical because the cream is quite thick but once I put this on my face...wow!! It soaked right in, didn't leave my face feeling dry & the fragrance was very pleasant!! I just started using so I haven't seen any definite results but when I do, I will be back to post those results!"
"Received this through Influenster compliments of L'Oréal . Love it this moisturizer is great my face feels wonderful, great under my makeup, after along day my face still feels great, I would recommend this product to everyone and I would definitely purchase Thank you [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
Really like this day cream alot. So hydarting it leaves my skin so soft and supple. Absorbs really well and not greasy so works well with my makeup routine. A little goes a lomg way and doesn't irrate my very sensitive skin. This is a good face cream.

"54 with combo/mostly dry skin. Day cream IS moisturizing, smells good, non-irritating but is tooo thick. Even after warming cream with fingertips it was a little hard to distribute, 5 stars for just a slightly less dense product. I received product free in a promotion. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I just started using this product yesterday. The packaging is beautiful. The product smells great. I found this moisturizer to be extremely thick. It seemed I was using more product than needed, due to the thick texture. It did seem to soak into my skin, and doesn't seem oily. I received this product to from Influenster to try for free. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I have used this product for 4 days and i am impressed at how soft and smooth my face feels and how much better my makeup smooths on .The only thing I don't like is the fact that it is a little heavy so a little goes a long way. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I was amazed at how nourished my skin is after using this day cream. My skin is supple, soft and looks so healthy. The cream is thick, but melts into your skin. It hydrates immediately without stickiness or greasiness. There is a very light fresh scent. It actually performs as advertised, wow! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
"I simply love the feel, the texture, and the smell of this product. It leaves my skin feeling soft, supple and radiant looking. I have read the list of ingredients and I am very impressed. I was very fortunate to receive this in a Vox Box. I will surely buy this product again. I highly recommend it to anyone with dry skin, or over the age of 50. It definitely feels like a high-end luxury face cream. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
After receiving a complimentary jar of the day cream I put it to use to see if it made a difference with my usual day cream. I noticed the creamy texture which provided a thicker application of day cream. That provided a longer lasting moisture barrier for an all day lasting effect. It was a bit on the shiny side when I looked an hour after application. It was still effective after a full day of wearing. Clean and fresh scent was appealing. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"I thought I would try ""just another cream that claims to solve dryness and flaky skin"" I did and it works on myself like no other expensive creams I have tried in the past.I use to put on the creams and make up and have flaky skin. Now, this cream, makes makeup stay creamy on my face. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"

"I researched this product and it sounded promising. I bought it and within the morning after the first application I swear I could tell a difference in the radiance, clarity and texture of my complexion. It was fabulous! I look forward to the long term results and will be trying additional products in this line. Love it!"
"This cream is not at all greasy, it melts in and feels silky smooth . I think it's a nicer product than some other night creams at the same price . Don't be fooled by the generic brands ( cvs ) that claim to be comparable , it's not . If you want Age perfect, buy Age perfect."
"Love this product! I began using it about 3 weeks ago and have seen a difference in my skin. I wear a CPAP mask each night, and air blowing on my nose causes dry skin - not anymore! I love the way it feels on my face, and the fragrance is great! Would recommend to anyone of ""a certain age."" [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
This is a very luxiourous night cream and feels wonderful on the skin! I love the packaging and love the way my skin looks in the morning. I like using all three products together and love the serum and SPF 15 Cream as well. I would have given it 5 stars if there was less fragrance or no fragrance in them.
It is fabulous my skin like perfect I will buy again Good price [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I was hoping for some fullness under my eyes and little lines by eyes. But I don't think it's worth The money.

I love how thick this product is. After applying it to my face my face feels so soft. I feel like already after only a couple days it's already working. I received this product for review
Super thick consistency surprised me but it spread easily and did not feel heavy. 3 hours later my skin still feels hydrated. Little to no product scent is a nice change. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
Just had the opportunity to try this and really like it! Doesn't take long to absorb and really seems to hydrate well. Received this complimentary for review and testing.
I had a sample container of this and was very pleased with the results....went on the skin very good and was not drying ....planned to buy it in the store [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
"Rich, creamy and it smells delicious! I know I'm doing my skin a lot of good when I apply this each night before bed, over the Age Perfect serum. Great for my 50 something skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I bought the trial pack from a leading drug store. Since my skin type is oily and sensitive. This cream blocked my pores and gave my blackheads overall. Very upset to use this product. I trusted the brand name and thought that this won't clog the pores. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
I received this product from Influenster for free to try out. I was not impressed with this product. It went on very heavy and made my face feel heavy and greasy all day long. I would not purchase this product. This product was not made for people with moderately oily skin. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]

Is the age perfect cell renewal night cream supposed to feel gritty when applying???
Or is it an old product that was on the shelf too long?
"Age Perfect Cell Renewal has really made a difference in my skin's appearance. Elasticity restored! But, the packaging has eco-system drawbacks. Neither the jar nor the box can be recycled."
I bought this after reading some good reviews but could not use it as the fragrance was overpowering for a night cream. I felt trike I put perfume on before going to bed.
"Just got started on Age Perfect, based on commercials, after years of Olay products. Very disappointed in the 3 items I purchased: serum, day cream, night cream. If anything, my skin looks worse - deeper wrinkles, no glow at all, and much too dry. Just glad I bought sample sizes of the creams, but still paid about $50.00 and too late to return. I do like the packaging & the scent, but the results make me run back to Olay."
I received a sample of this priduct and I love it!
I'd receive this product and I'm loving it. I will definitely buy it.
"My skin loves this cream! Non greasy, smells great and feels amazing!"
"Nightly regimen, and couldn't live without it. For night repair, try this"
The 24 hour lives up to its promise ! Its a great daytime life saver!
After first applying my skin felt more moist and plump.
"I have not ever been one to follow a regular skin care regimen in the past but with my skin becoming dry rough and dull looking, I decided after some research, to try this program. With high hopes (Im turning 55) I made a concerted effort to improve my skin. Never too late right?! The cell renewal nighttime cream seems heavy at first but it absorbs very quickly and does not feel greasy at all and my skin feels smoother when I have it on. I still have rough dry skin on my cheeks and forehead even after several weeks of use."
"L'Oreal Age Perfect Cell Renewal is amazing...I have been using it for a month now. I am really impressed! I swim everyday in a chlorinated indoor pool which makes my skin so dry and pinched feeling. The first time I applied the cell renewal, my skin felt soft as a babies tender cheeks. It seems to plump up those dry cells and revitalize them. Wonderful product! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]"
I've been wanting to buy this to give it a try and so glad that I did. No other product compares
"I love the product, but the fragrance is far too strong. It keeps me from wearing it."
This stuff is superb and I would definitely recommend it to a friend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
