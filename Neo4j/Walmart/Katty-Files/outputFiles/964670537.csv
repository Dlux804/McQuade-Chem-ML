I just received this and my first impression is 5 stars!! It smells amazing and makes my skin so soft. I can not wait to see how this product works!
Just received my serun and couldnât wait to try it! I immedatle fel the dirrence in my skin- i canât wait to see the difference over the next few weeks.
This was a good purchase. I'm so glad I found Tree of Life. This made my skin so soft and glowing after the 1st use. Will be trying more Tree of life products soon.
This product was recommended to me by a friend. It has a milky gel like texture which absorbs into my skin nicely. I use this niacinamide serum mainly at night on my acne prone areas. So far so good; no breakouts or irritations. It does leave my face feeling nicely moisturized without feeling too heavy. I am definitely going to keep using it.
I just started using this and so far I really like it.
I have sun damage on my face and I am counting on this product to repair the damage. Just started using it but I can already see some change.
I love this serum! I have used Niacinamide before ( a different brand) but THIS brand is cheaper and I get the same great results! Will always maintain this as apart of my daily skincare regimen!
"Great moisturizer. I have only been using for a week but so far I am satisfied. I use this product before bed and my skin looks and feels succulent. Also, my pores appear to be smaller. Yay!"
"I have just started using this niacinamide serum for few days. I like the serum.It feels silky and smooth on the face.I have very sensitive ,dry and eczema prone skin.It suits well with my skin.It is very soon to say about the improvement.Once I finish the whole bottle , I will give my update(hopefully)."
"This Serum is lightweight and feels cool on my face. This particular one I use at night after I've cleansed my face. I have yet to see major results but I feel that as a moisturizing Serum, it's perfect."
