So moisture rich and non greasy. I love this product! I have very sensitive skin because of Lupus and this moisturizer is amazing! I am hooked. Will definitely buy again!
I've been using this for a little over a week and I really enjoy the way it smells and feels. It's not greasy at all. I put it on after I wash my face before I go to bed and in the morning my face is very soft and refreshed. I haven't used it long enough to see the other results but I do Love it already.
I use the product every evening makes your skin feel well hydrated. The products do not leave a heavy residue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]
not sure i feel a difference between this one and the day creme. so i will wait and see.
