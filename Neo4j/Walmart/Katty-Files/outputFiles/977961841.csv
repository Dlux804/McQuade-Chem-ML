"I have oily skin with several acne scars, so after trying expensive chemical peelings done by a professional, I decided to try this product at home. It itches once I put into the skin and turned red, but the results are really great. My face looks better, my scars are less visible and some premature wrinkles has dissapeared after 3 months using this product. I definetely recommed it. I advice to use a good retinol serum every day and sun block during this treatment."
"Years ago, I had dark patches develop on my upper cheeks. Glycolic acid alone wasn't exfoliating the skin fast enough, so a combination of scuffing up my skin with a gritty facial wash and then applying glycolic acid sped it up. It got rid of the patches. This 70% solution stuff is much better. I'm now using it to eliminate bags under my eyes. I still recommend the gritty face wash first. Be sure to buy the neutralizer, too. If not, baking soda and water works fine, too."
"Ok, this is the real deal. Only wait one minute after lightly applying then spray with neutralizer. If you have already bought this and don't have the neutralizer mix some water and baking soda in a spray bottle, spray heavily all over the area you put the peel on, wait one minute and rinse for at least a minute with cool water. Baking soda ONLY if you don't have the neutralizer . DO NOT use this without some kind of neutralizer!!!!!!! I can't believe how well this stuff works"
"I don't have acne but age spots. I can see them diminishing. I have used it three times within two week and see a difference each time. My face feels tightener and the bags under my eyes are diminishing substantially. I don't have wrinkles anywhere else but feel that doing this again after I finish the six treatments will keep me from having wrinkles. For those in there 6th century, you don't have to look old at all. ."
An awesome product. Not for use by a novice as it can be irritating. I've been using glycolic acid for years by pros and at home. For me it delivered the expected soft skin and overall glow.
