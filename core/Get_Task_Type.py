""" This function allows for main.py to skip over algorithm/data set combinations that are not compatible.

The checker variable is set to 0 if the combination is not compatible, and 1 otherwise.

It is then returned to main.py, where it is used to decide if the model/data set combination should be ran,
or the combination should be skipped.

This function also allows for the task type to be returned, so that it can be printed in main.py.
