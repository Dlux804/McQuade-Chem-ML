    "### Approach\n",
    "1. Split molecules into \"easy to predict\" and \"hard to predict\"\n",
    "    1. Top and bottom quartiles of scaled average error\n",
    "    2. This might need to be **dataset specific**.  Molecules or fragments that are difficult to predict for one\n",
    "      property may not be difficult for the next.  These effects will offset in an average error.\n",
    "      Try logP14k without scaled error in next attempt.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compare and contrast fragments from these groups.\n",
    "    1. Are the most common (by number of appearances) the same?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Remove highly conserved fragments.  Fragments that are present in both in easy and hard to predict molecule sets\n",
    " are removed.\n",
    "    1. This might remove all fragments?\n",
    "    2. Maybe remove the top `n` most frequent or the top `X%` most frequent\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Create graph projection with remaining molecules and fragments. Create unweighted and weighted graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Run PageRank algorithm on both graph projections.\n",
    "    1. Return fragments rank and score.  Collect results in CSV.\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Analyze results."
