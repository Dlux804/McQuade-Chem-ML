The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 12 h, concentrated under reduced pressure, and the residual oil dissolved in EtOAc. The solution was treated with 10% HCl, and the organic layer washed with H2O, and saturated aqueous NaCl, before being dried over Na2SO4. Removal of the solvents under reduced pressure gave the title compound as a pale green solid after recrystallization from EtOH.']","[{'chemical_names': ['3,4-dihydro-1-(2-thienyl)-4,4-dimethyl-6-acetylnaphthalene'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CC(=O)c1ccc2c(c1)C(C)(C)CC=C2c1cccs1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C18H18OS/c1-12(19)13-6-7-14-15(17-5-4-10-20-17)8-9-18(2,3)16(14)11-13/h4-8,10-11H,9H2,1-3H3'], 'amounts': ['0.222 mmol', '62.6 mg'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['4-carboxy benzaldehyde'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:O=Cc1ccc(C(=O)O)cc1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C8H6O3/c9-5-6-1-3-7(4-2-6)8(10)11/h1-5H,(H,10,11)'], 'amounts': ['0.222 mmol', '33.4 mg'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['NaOH'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:[Na+].[OH-]', 'inchi:InChI=1S/Na.H2O/h;1H2/q+1;/p-1'], 'amounts': ['3M', '2.0 mL'], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['title compound', '4-[3-oxo-3-(7,8-dihydro-5-(2-thienyl)-8,8-dimethyl-2-naphthalenyl)-1-propenyl]-benzoic acid'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CC1(C)CC=C(c2cccs2)c2ccc(C(=O)C=Cc3ccc(C(=O)O)cc3)cc21', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C26H22O3S/c1-26(2)14-13-21(24-4-3-15-30-24)20-11-10-19(16-22(20)26)23(27)12-7-17-5-8-18(9-6-17)25(28)29/h3-13,15-16H,14H2,1-2H3,(H,28,29)'], 'amounts': [], 'appearances': ['pale green']}]","[{'chemical_names': ['MeOH'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CO', 'inchi:InChI=1S/CH4O/c1-2/h2H,1H3'], 'amounts': ['4.0 mL'], 'appearances': []}]",[],"['step 1:To a solution of 62.6 mg (0.222 mmol) 3,4-dihydro-1-(2-thienyl)-4,4-dimethyl-6-acetylnaphthalene (Compound D33) in 4.0 mL of MeOH were added 33.4 mg (0.222 mmol) of 4-carboxy benzaldehyde, and 240.0 mg (6.00 mmol; 2.0 mL of 3M aqueous NaOH)', 'step 2:The resulting solution was stirred at room temperature for 12 h', 'step 2 properties:Time:43200', 'step 2 properties:Temperature:room temperature', 'step 3:concentrated under reduced pressure', 'step 3 properties:Pressure:reduced pressure', 'step 4:the residual oil dissolved in EtOAc', 'step 5:The solution was treated with 10% HCl', 'step 6:the organic layer washed with H2O, and saturated aqueous NaCl', 'step 7:before being dried over Na2SO4', 'step 8:Removal of the solvents under reduced pressure', 'step 8 properties:Pressure:reduced pressure', 'step 9:gave the title compound as a pale green solid']"
