The mixture was stirred overnight and was allowed to reach room temperature. The mixture was cooled down to 0-5° C., diluted with water (200 mL) and ethyl acetate (200 mL). The organic phase was separated and the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (100 mL). The combined organic phases were washed with brine and dried over anhydrous magnesium sulfate, filtered and concentrated.
