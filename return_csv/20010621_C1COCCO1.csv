Preparation of 4-Formylphenylacetic Acid', '0061', 'To a stirred solution of the title compound of Example 1 (46.9 g, 200 mmol) in dioxane (500 mL) and water (500 mL) was added osmium tetroxide (0.5 g, 4% in water), followed by sodium periodate (85.56 g, 400 mmol). The reaction mixture was monitored by HPLC, stirred for 1 hour and N-methylmorpholine (1.0 g) was added, followed by additional osmium tetroxide (1.0 g) after another 16 hours. After 4 hours stirring at room temperature, additional sodium periodate (40 g) was added, the reaction stirred for 21 hours, filtered, and the filter cake washed with ethyl acetate (500 mL). The phases were separated, the aqueous layer extracted with ethyl acetate (500 mL), the remaining aqueous layer acidified with hydrochloric acid (30 mL), extracted with ethyl acetate (500 mL), and the combined organic phases washed with water (500 mL), saturated sodium chloride solution (250 mL), dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and the solvent removed in vacuo. The wet solid was triturated with methyl tert-butyl ether (50 mL) and to the resulting slurry was added pentane (100 mL). The slurry was filtered, the solid product was washed with pentane (2 X 25 mL) and dried to give the title compound (12.4 g, 38%).
