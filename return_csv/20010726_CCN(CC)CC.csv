The resulting solution is then added, at 0° C., to a solution of 11.23 ml of indoline and 15.46 ml of triethylamine in 200 ml of dichloromethane. After stirring for 24hours at ambient temperature, 10 N hydrochloric acid is added. The organic phase is then washed with hydrochloric acid and then with water, and is dried, filtered and concentrated, allowing the expected product to be obtained.']","[{'chemical_names': ['2-bromoethanol'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:OCCBr', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C2H5BrO/c3-1-2-4/h4H,1-2H2'], 'amounts': ['7.1 ml'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['chlorosulphonyl isocyanate'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:O=C=NS(=O)(=O)Cl', 'inchi:InChI=1S/CClNO3S/c2-7(5,6)3-1-4'], 'amounts': ['8.72 ml'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['indoline'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:c1ccc2c(c1)CCN2', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C8H9N/c1-2-4-8-7(3-1)5-6-9-8/h1-4,9H,5-6H2'], 'amounts': ['11.23 ml'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['hydrochloric acid'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:Cl', 'inchi:InChI=1S/ClH/h1H'], 'amounts': ['10 N'], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['3-(2,3-Dihydroindol-1-ylsulphonyl)-1,3-oxazolidin-2-one'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:O=C1OCCN1S(=O)(=O)N1CCc2ccccc21', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C11H12N2O4S/c14-11-13(7-8-17-11)18(15,16)12-6-5-9-3-1-2-4-10(9)12/h1-4H,5-8H2'], 'amounts': [], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['dichloromethane'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:ClCCl', 'inchi:InChI=1S/CH2Cl2/c2-1-3/h1H2'], 'amounts': ['50 ml'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['dichloromethane'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:ClCCl', 'inchi:InChI=1S/CH2Cl2/c2-1-3/h1H2'], 'amounts': ['40 ml'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['dichloromethane'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:ClCCl', 'inchi:InChI=1S/CH2Cl2/c2-1-3/h1H2'], 'amounts': ['200 ml'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['triethylamine'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CCN(CC)CC', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C6H15N/c1-4-7(5-2)6-3/h4-6H2,1-3H3'], 'amounts': ['15.46 ml'], 'appearances': []}]",[],"['step 1:7.1 ml of 2-bromoethanol in 50 ml of dichloromethane are added to a solution of 8.72 ml of chlorosulphonyl isocyanate in 40 ml of dichloromethane', 'step 2:The resulting solution is then added, at 0° C., to a solution of 11.23 ml of indoline and 15.46 ml of triethylamine in 200 ml of dichloromethane', 'step 2 properties:Temperature:0', 'step 3:After stirring for 24hours at ambient temperature', 'step 3 properties:Time:86400', 'step 3 properties:Temperature:room temperature', 'step 4:10 N hydrochloric acid is added', 'step 5:The organic phase is then washed with hydrochloric acid', 'step 6:with water, and is dried', 'step 7:filtered', 'step 8:concentrated', 'step 9:to be obtained']"
