The solution was cooled to −78° C. and 21.7 ml (43.4 mmol) of 2 M phenyl lithium in diethyl ether were added dropwise keeping the temperature between −60 and −70° C. The temperature was allowed to rise to room temperature and the solution was stirred 1 hour. The reaction was quenched with 30 ml NH4Cl 10%, diluted with water, extracted with Et2O and evaporated in vacuo to dryness. The crude product was dissolved in 100 ml of EtOH, 10 g of KOH pellets were added and the mixture was maintained at room temperature overnight. The solvent was evaporated in vacuo to dryness and the residue, dissolved in water, was extracted with Et2O. The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4, evaporated in vacuo to dryness and purified by flash column chromatography on 230-400 mesh silica gel, utilising a mixture of hexane/EtOAc 7:3 as eluent, to afford 8 g of the title compound.']","[{'chemical_names': ['γ-Butyrolactone'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:O=C1CCCO1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C4H6O2/c5-4-2-1-3-6-4/h1-3H2'], 'amounts': ['130.01 mmol', '11.2 g'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['phenyl lithium'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:[Li]c1ccccc1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C6H5.Li/c1-2-4-6-5-3-1;/h1-5H;'], 'amounts': ['43.4 mmol', '2 M', '21.7 ml'], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['title compound', '4-Phenyl-4-oxobutanol'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:O=C(CCCO)c1ccccc1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C10H12O2/c11-8-4-7-10(12)9-5-2-1-3-6-9/h1-3,5-6,11H,4,7-8H2'], 'amounts': ['8 g', '112.3'], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['THF'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:C1CCOC1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C4H8O/c1-2-4-5-3-1/h1-4H2'], 'amounts': ['50 ml'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['diethyl ether'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CCOCC', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C4H10O/c1-3-5-4-2/h3-4H2,1-2H3'], 'amounts': [], 'appearances': []}]",[],"['step 1:11.2 g (130.01 mmol) of γ-Butyrolactone were dissolved, under nitrogen atmosphere, in 50 ml of dry THF', 'step 2:The solution was cooled to −78° C.', 'step 2 properties:Temperature:-78', 'step 3:21.7 ml (43.4 mmol) of 2 M phenyl lithium in diethyl ether were added dropwise', 'step 4:the temperature between −60 and −70° C', 'step 4 properties:Temperature:-60 to -70', 'step 5:to rise to room temperature', 'step 5 properties:Temperature:room temperature', 'step 6:the solution was stirred 1 hour', 'step 6 properties:Time:3600', 'step 7:The reaction was quenched with 30 ml NH4Cl 10%', 'step 8:diluted with water', 'step 9:extracted with Et2O', 'step 10:evaporated in vacuo to dryness', 'step 11:The crude product was dissolved in 100 ml of EtOH', 'step 12:10 g of KOH pellets were added', 'step 13:the mixture was maintained at room temperature overnight', 'step 13 properties:Time:overnight', 'step 13 properties:Temperature:room temperature', 'step 14:The solvent was evaporated in vacuo to dryness', 'step 15:the residue, dissolved in water', 'step 16:was extracted with Et2O', 'step 17:The organic layer was dried over Na2SO4', 'step 18:evaporated in vacuo to dryness', 'step 19:purified by flash column chromatography on 230-400 mesh silica gel, utilising', 'step 20:a mixture of hexane/EtOAc 7:3 as eluent', 'step 21:to afford 8 g of the title compound']"
