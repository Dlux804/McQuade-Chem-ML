The reaction was stirred at 0째 C. for 2 hours and at room temperature for an additional 10 hours. The reaction mixture was then diluted with ethyl ether (100 ml) and the two layers were separated. The organic layer was dried (MgSO4), the solid was filtered and the filtrate was concentrated. The residue was then heated with hexane (200 ml) and the insolubles were filtered off the hot solution. The filtrate was concentrated to give a mixture of (3,4-methylenedioxy)-6-methylbenzyl chloride (9.4 g, 63% yield) and bis[(3,4-methylenedioxy)-6-methyl]phenylmethane (3.6 g) as a white solid.
