After completion of the addition, the reaction mixture was allowed to attain ambient temperature slowly and stirred for 1 h. The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (50 ml), washed with water and the organic layer dried over anhydrous MgSO4. Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure gave crude product, which was purified by column chromatography, using hexane followed by 5% ethyl acetate in hexane as eluent, to give 3-biphenylsulfonyl chloride as an oil (0.8 g, 49% yield).']","[{'chemical_names': ['3-Bromobiphenyl'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:Brc1cccc(-c2ccccc2)c1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C12H9Br/c13-12-8-4-7-11(9-12)10-5-2-1-3-6-10/h1-9H'], 'amounts': ['6.4 mmol', '1.5 g'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['t-Butyllithium'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:[Li]C(C)(C)C', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C4H9.Li/c1-4(2)3;/h1-3H3;'], 'amounts': ['6.4 mmol', '1.7 M', '3.8 ml'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['sulfuryl chloride'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:O=S(=O)(Cl)Cl', 'inchi:InChI=1S/Cl2O2S/c1-5(2,3)4'], 'amounts': ['6.4 mmol', '0.64 ml'], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['3-biphenylsulfonyl chloride'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:O=S(=O)(Cl)c1cccc(-c2ccccc2)c1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C12H9ClO2S/c13-16(14,15)12-8-4-7-11(9-12)10-5-2-1-3-6-10/h1-9H'], 'amounts': ['0.8 g', '49% yield', '49.5'], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['ether'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CCOCC', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C4H10O/c1-3-5-4-2/h3-4H2,1-2H3'], 'amounts': ['15 ml'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['ethyl acetate'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CCOC(C)=O', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C4H8O2/c1-3-6-4(2)5/h3H2,1-2H3'], 'amounts': ['50 ml'], 'appearances': []}]",[],"['step 1:3-Bromobiphenyl (1.5 g, 6.4 mmol) was dissolved in ether (15 ml)', 'step 2:cooled to −78° C. t-Butyllithium (1.7 M solution in hexane, 3.8 ml, 6.4 mmol)', 'step 2 properties:Temperature:-78', 'step 3:was added dropwise', 'step 4:under constant stirring', 'step 5:The resultant reaction mixture', 'step 6:was stirred at −10° C. to −5° C. for 6 h', 'step 6 properties:Time:21600', 'step 6 properties:Temperature:-10 to -5', 'step 7:The reaction mixture was cooled to −78° C.', 'step 7 properties:Temperature:-78', 'step 8:sulfuryl chloride (0.64 ml, 6.4 mmol) was added dropwise', 'step 9:After completion of the addition', 'step 10:to attain ambient temperature', 'step 10 properties:Temperature:room temperature', 'step 11:stirred for 1 h', 'step 11 properties:Time:3600', 'step 12:The reaction mixture was diluted with ethyl acetate (50 ml)', 'step 13:washed with water', 'step 14:the organic layer dried over anhydrous MgSO4', 'step 15:Removal of the solvent under reduced pressure', 'step 15 properties:Pressure:reduced pressure', 'step 16:gave crude product, which', 'step 17:was purified by column chromatography', 'step 18:to give 3-biphenylsulfonyl chloride as an oil (0.8 g, 49% yield)']"
