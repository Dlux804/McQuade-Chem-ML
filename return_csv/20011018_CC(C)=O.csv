The structure was verified by 1HNMR spectroscopy.']","[{'chemical_names': ['2,4-bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)-6-(2,4-dihydroxy-5-hexylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CCCCCCc1cc(-c2nc(-c3ccc(C(C)(C)C)cc3)nc(-c3ccc(C(C)(C)C)cc3)n2)c(O)cc1O', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C35H43N3O2/c1-8-9-10-11-12-25-21-28(30(40)22-29(25)39)33-37-31(23-13-17-26(18-14-23)34(2,3)4)36-32(38-33)24-15-19-27(20-16-24)35(5,6)7/h13-22,39-40H,8-12H2,1-7H3'], 'amounts': ['10 g'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['potassium carbonate'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:O=C([O-])[O-].[K+].[K+]', 'inchi:InChI=1S/CH2O3.2K/c2-1(3)4;;/h(H2,2,3,4);;/q;2*+1/p-2'], 'amounts': ['7.4 g'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['potassium iodide'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:[I-].[K+]', 'inchi:InChI=1S/HI.K/h1H;/q;+1/p-1'], 'amounts': ['0.5 g'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['ethyl chloroacetate'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CCOC(=O)CCl', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C4H7ClO2/c1-2-7-4(6)3-5/h2-3H2,1H3'], 'amounts': ['2.2 mL', '2.5 g'], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['2,6-bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)-6-(2-hydroxy-4-ethoxycarbonylmethoxy-5-hexylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CCCCCCc1cc(C2(c3ccc(C(C)(C)C)cc3)N=CN=C(c3ccc(C(C)(C)C)cc3)N2)c(O)cc1OCC(=O)OCC', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C39H51N3O4/c1-9-11-12-13-14-28-23-32(33(43)24-34(28)46-25-35(44)45-10-2)39(31-21-19-30(20-22-31)38(6,7)8)41-26-40-36(42-39)27-15-17-29(18-16-27)37(3,4)5/h15-24,26,43H,9-14,25H2,1-8H3,(H,40,41,42)'], 'amounts': ['10 g', '171.8'], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['acetone'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CC(C)=O', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C3H6O/c1-3(2)4/h1-2H3'], 'amounts': ['80 mL'], 'appearances': []}]",[],"['step 1:To a stirred mixture of 10 g of 2,4-bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)-6-(2,4-dihydroxy-5-hexylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine, 7.4 g of anhydrous potassium carbonate, 0.5 g of potassium iodide, and 80 mL of acetone', 'step 2:was added 2.2 mL (2.5 g) of ethyl chloroacetate', 'step 3:The mixture was stirred', 'step 4:at reflux for 2.5 h', 'step 4 properties:Time:9000', 'step 5:to cool to room temperature', 'step 5 properties:Temperature:room temperature', 'step 6:The solids were removed by filtration', 'step 7:washed with methylene chloride', 'step 8:The combined filtrates were concentrated under reduced pressure to a volume of 75 mL', 'step 8 properties:Pressure:reduced pressure', 'step 9:diluted with 50 mL of methanol', 'step 10:The resulting solid was collected by filtration', 'step 11:washed with methanol', 'step 12:After drying in vacuo', 'step 13:10 g of 2,6-bis(4-tert-butylphenyl)-6-(2-hydroxy-4-ethoxycarbonylmethoxy-5-hexylphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine was obtained']"
