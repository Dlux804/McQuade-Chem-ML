This ketone is isolated and then undergoes ring closure to form the 3-hydroxy-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyridin-2-one intermediate in steps c and d using ethyl oxalyl chloride and sodium hydroxide in step c and sodium ethoxide and ethanol in step d. The corresponding 3-methoxy intermediate is obtained in step e by treatment with 3-methyl-p-tolyltriazine, after which in step f the 4,5,6,7-tetrahydro-7-oxo-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-c]pyridine intermediate is obtained by ring closure using cyclopentyl hydrazine hydrochloride. The 4-methoxyphenyl N-protecting group is removed in step g by treatment with cerium (IV) ammonium nitrate to give the lactam intermediate, after which in step h the lactam intermediate is converted to the corresponding thiolactam intermediate by treatment with phosphorus pentasulfide. The tricyclic final product is prepared in steps i, j, and k by treatment with anhydrous hydrazine in step i, followed by treatment with 2-thiophene carbonyl chloride in step j and refluxing in step k.']","[{'chemical_names': ['2-pyrrolidinone'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:O=C1CCCN1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C4H7NO/c6-4-2-1-3-5-4/h1-3H2,(H,5,6)'], 'amounts': [], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['4-iodoanisole'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:COc1ccc(I)cc1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C7H7IO/c1-9-7-4-2-6(8)3-5-7/h2-5H,1H3'], 'amounts': [], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['potassium carbonate'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:O=C([O-])[O-].[K+].[K+]', 'inchi:InChI=1S/CH2O3.2K/c2-1(3)4;;/h(H2,2,3,4);;/q;2*+1/p-2'], 'amounts': [], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['N-(4-methoxyphenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:COc1ccc(N2CCCC2=O)cc1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C11H13NO2/c1-14-10-6-4-9(5-7-10)12-8-2-3-11(12)13/h4-7H,2-3,8H2,1H3'], 'amounts': [], 'appearances': []}]",[],"[{'chemical_names': ['copper'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:[Cu]', 'inchi:InChI=1S/Cu'], 'amounts': [], 'appearances': []}]","['step 1:In step a of the overall synthesis, 2-pyrrolidinone and 4-iodoanisole', 'step 2:are heated in the presence of copper powder and potassium carbonate', 'step 3:to give the N-(4-methoxyphenyl)pyrrolidin-2-one, which in step b']"
