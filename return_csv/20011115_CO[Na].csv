The dibromoketone was reduced with BH3*THF to the corresponding alcohol (1.2.4.15). This compound was reacted with MeONa in methanol to yield 2-(1-bromoethyl)-3-methyl oxirane (1.2.4.13) which after reaction with MeOH/H2SO4 gave 2-bromo-3-hydroxy-4-methoxy pentane (1.2.4.38). This intermediate was reacted again with MeONa in methanol and the resulting 2-(1-methoxyethyl)-3-methyl oxirane (1.2.4.22) was reacted again with MeOH/H2SO4 to yield 2,4-dimethoxy-3-hydroxy pentane (1.2.4.39).
