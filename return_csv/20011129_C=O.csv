Formaldehyde (5.3 mL) and formic acid (2.6 mL) were added and the clear solution was heated to reflux (˜58° C.). The mixture was maintained under reflux for 3 hours then cooled to less than 40° C. and 102 mL of water was added. The acetone was separated from the reaction mixture by distillation under low vacuum (˜300 mbar). The distillation was stopped when the temperature of the liquid phase reaches ˜40° C./300 mbar. Activated carbon SXI (1.25 g) was added and the suspension was mixed for 1 hour. Then the activated carbon was separated from the solution by filtration on a Büchner filter containing Hyflow. The filter cake was washed with 102 mL of water. The pH was adjusted with an NaOH solution of 47% to 10-10.5 (˜3.14 g). A massive precipitation of Azithromycin was observed. After stirring the suspension for 1 hour, the crude azithromycin was separated by filtration, washed twice with 25 mL of water and dried at 40° C. in a vacuum oven for>24 hours. After drying, 19.7 g of crude azithromycin was obtained (yield 77% based on weight). No impurities that were derivatives of azithromycin were detected.']","[{'chemical_names': ['desmethyl-azithromycin'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CC[C@H]1OC(=O)[C@H](C)[C@@H](O[C@H]2C[C@@](C)(OC)[C@@H](O)[C@H](C)O2)[C@H](C)[C@@H](O[C@@H]2O[C@H](C)C[C@H](N(C)C)[C@H]2O)[C@](C)(O)C[C@@H](C)CN[C@H](C)[C@@H](O)[C@]1(C)O', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C37H70N2O12/c1-14-26-37(10,45)30(41)23(6)38-18-19(2)16-35(8,44)32(51-34-28(40)25(39(11)12)15-20(3)47-34)21(4)29(22(5)33(43)49-26)50-27-17-36(9,46-13)31(42)24(7)48-27/h19-32,34,38,40-42,44-45H,14-18H2,1-13H3/t19-,20-,21+,22-,23-,24+,25+,26-,27+,28-,29+,30-,31+,32-,34+,35-,36-,37-/m1/s1'], 'amounts': ['25 g'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['Formaldehyde'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:C=O', 'inchi:InChI=1S/CH2O/c1-2/h1H2'], 'amounts': ['5.3 mL'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['formic acid'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:O=CO', 'inchi:InChI=1S/CH2O2/c2-1-3/h1H,(H,2,3)'], 'amounts': ['2.6 mL'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['water'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:O', 'inchi:InChI=1S/H2O/h1H2'], 'amounts': ['102 mL'], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['azithromycin'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CC[C@H]1OC(=O)[C@H](C)[C@@H](O[C@H]2C[C@@](C)(OC)[C@@H](O)[C@H](C)O2)[C@H](C)[C@@H](O[C@@H]2O[C@H](C)C[C@H](N(C)C)[C@H]2O)[C@](C)(O)C[C@@H](C)CN(C)[C@H](C)[C@@H](O)[C@]1(C)O', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C38H72N2O12/c1-15-27-38(10,46)31(42)24(6)40(13)19-20(2)17-36(8,45)33(52-35-29(41)26(39(11)12)16-21(3)48-35)22(4)30(23(5)34(44)50-27)51-28-18-37(9,47-14)32(43)25(7)49-28/h20-33,35,41-43,45-46H,15-19H2,1-14H3/t20-,21-,22+,23-,24-,25+,26+,27-,28+,29-,30+,31-,32+,33-,35+,36-,37-,38-/m1/s1'], 'amounts': ['19.7 g', 'yield 77%'], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['acetone'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CC(C)=O', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C3H6O/c1-3(2)4/h1-2H3'], 'amounts': ['102 mL'], 'appearances': []}]",[],"['step 1:In a 0.25 L three-necked round bottom flask equipped with a mechanical stirrer, a condenser', 'step 2:thermometer, 25 g of desmethyl-azithromycin was dissolved in 102 mL of acetone', 'step 3:Formaldehyde (5.3 mL) and formic acid (2.6 mL) were added', 'step 4:the clear solution was heated', 'step 5:to reflux (˜58° C.)', 'step 5 properties:Temperature:~58', 'step 6:The mixture was maintained', 'step 7:under reflux for 3 hours', 'step 7 properties:Time:10800', 'step 8:then cooled to less than 40° C.', 'step 8 properties:Temperature:<40', 'step 9:102 mL of water was added', 'step 10:The acetone was separated from the reaction mixture by distillation under low vacuum (˜300 mbar)', 'step 10 properties:Pressure:~30000', 'step 11:The distillation', 'step 12:reaches ˜40° C.', 'step 12 properties:Temperature:~40', 'step 13:Activated carbon SXI (1.25 g) was added', 'step 14:the suspension was mixed for 1 hour', 'step 14 properties:Time:3600', 'step 15:Then the activated carbon was separated from the solution by filtration on a Büchner', 'step 16:filter', 'step 17:containing Hyflow', 'step 18:The filter cake was washed with 102 mL of water', 'step 19:A massive precipitation of Azithromycin', 'step 20:After stirring the suspension for 1 hour', 'step 20 properties:Time:3600', 'step 21:the crude azithromycin was separated by filtration', 'step 22:washed twice with 25 mL of water', 'step 23:dried at 40° C. in a vacuum oven for>24 hours', 'step 23 properties:Time:86400', 'step 23 properties:Temperature:40', 'step 24:After drying', 'step 25:19.7 g of crude azithromycin was obtained (yield 77% based on weight)']"
