After 2.5 hours the mixture was concentrated in vacuo. The residue was suspended in 200 ml of 4% aqueous hydrochloric acid, and the product was collected by filtration, washed sequentially with water and diethyl ether, and air dried to yield 12.2 g of 2-mercapto-5-methylbenzimidazole, as confirmed by the nmr and infrared spectra. The title compound (2.0 g) was prepared by the method of Example 84 using 1.6 g (9.7 mmole) of 2-mercapto-5-methylbenzimidazole instead of 2-mercaptobenzimidazole.
