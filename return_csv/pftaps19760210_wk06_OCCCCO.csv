The reaction was followed by hydrogen evolution and it required over 8 hours to complete so the reaction was stirred overnight. The next morning, 9.59 grams (.047 moles) of 2-t-butylazo-2-chloro-4-methylpentane was added dropwise at room temperature to the stirred salt solution. After the addition was complete, the reaction was stirred 4 hours and then checked by gas chromatography. Gas chromatography indicated there was a small amount of unreacted 2-t-butylazo-2-chloro-4-methylpentane left so the reaction was allowed to stir overnight. The next day, the reaction mixture was poured into 200 mls. of cold water and extracted with pentane. The pentane solution was washed with H2O, dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate, filtered and the pentane evaporated to leave 9.3 grams (93% yield) of a straw yellow liquid. The crude product was purified by column chromatography over alumina, using pentane as the eluent. The infrared spectrum of the purified material was in agreement with the structure of the desired product.']","[{'chemical_names': ['sodium hydride'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:[H-].[Na+]', 'inchi:InChI=1S/Na.H/q+1;-1'], 'amounts': ['.047 moles', '1.98 grams'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['1,4-butanediol'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:OCCCCO', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C4H10O2/c5-3-1-2-4-6/h5-6H,1-4H2'], 'amounts': ['.0235 moles', '2.11 grams'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['hydrogen'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:[H][H]', 'inchi:InChI=1S/H2/h1H'], 'amounts': [], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['2-t-butylazo-2-chloro-4-methylpentane'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CC(C)CC(C)(Cl)N=NC(C)(C)C', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C10H21ClN2/c1-8(2)7-10(6,11)13-12-9(3,4)5/h8H,7H2,1-6H3'], 'amounts': ['.047 moles', '9.59 grams'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['2-t-butylazo-2-chloro-4-methylpentane'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CC(C)CC(C)(Cl)N=NC(C)(C)C', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C10H21ClN2/c1-8(2)7-10(6,11)13-12-9(3,4)5/h8H,7H2,1-6H3'], 'amounts': [], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['straw yellow liquid', '1,4-Bis[ 1-(t-butylazo)-1,3-dimethylbutoxy]butane'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CC(C)CC(C)(N=NC(C)(C)C)OCCCCOC(C)(CC(C)C)N=NC(C)(C)C', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C24H50N4O2/c1-19(2)17-23(11,27-25-21(5,6)7)29-15-13-14-16-30-24(12,18-20(3)4)28-26-22(8,9)10/h19-20H,13-18H2,1-12H3'], 'amounts': ['9.3 grams', '93% yield', '92.7'], 'appearances': ['straw yellow']}]","[{'chemical_names': ['dioxane'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:C1COCCO1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C4H8O2/c1-2-6-4-3-5-1/h1-4H2'], 'amounts': [], 'appearances': []}]",[],"['step 1:reaction flask', 'step 2:equipped with a magnetic stirrer', 'step 3:thermometer, addition funnel', 'step 4:gas bubbler, was added 2.11 grams (.0235 moles) of 1,4-butanediol', 'step 5:required over 8 hours', 'step 5 properties:Time:28800', 'step 6:was stirred overnight', 'step 6 properties:Time:overnight', 'step 7:The next morning, 9.59 grams (.047 moles) of 2-t-butylazo-2-chloro-4-methylpentane was added dropwise at room temperature to the stirred salt solution', 'step 7 properties:Temperature:room temperature', 'step 8:After the addition', 'step 9:the reaction was stirred 4 hours', 'step 9 properties:Time:14400', 'step 10:left so the reaction', 'step 11:to stir overnight', 'step 11 properties:Time:overnight', 'step 12:The next day, the reaction mixture was poured into 200 mls', 'step 13:of cold water and extracted with pentane', 'step 14:The pentane solution was washed with H2O', 'step 15:dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate', 'step 16:filtered', 'step 17:the pentane evaporated', 'step 18:to leave 9.3 grams (93% yield) of a straw yellow liquid']"
