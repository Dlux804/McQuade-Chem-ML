When the temperature reached 60° C., 111.88 ml of molten maleic anhydride was introduced. At 80° C., separate feeds of 175.35 ml of methyl vinyl ether and 1.17 g of decanoyl peroxide in 33 g of acetone were introduced into the reactor over a period of 3 hours, with the methyl vinyl ether feed begun 10 min. before the decanoyl peroxide-acetone solution. After the feed was completed, the reactor was maintained at 80° C. for an additional half-hour. The reactor was then cooled to provide a thick, viscous light amber colored solution of the desired copolymer product in acetone.']","[{'chemical_names': ['N,N′-1,3-phenylenedimaleimide'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:O=C1C=CC(=O)N1c1cccc(N2C(=O)C=CC2=O)c1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C14H8N2O4/c17-11-4-5-12(18)15(11)9-2-1-3-10(8-9)16-13(19)6-7-14(16)20/h1-8H'], 'amounts': ['0.201 g'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['acetone'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CC(C)=O', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C3H6O/c1-3(2)4/h1-2H3'], 'amounts': ['513.88 g'], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['desired copolymer', 'Maleic Anhydride Methyl Vinyl Ether N,N′-1,3-Phenylenedimaleimide'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:C=COC.O=C1C=CC(=O)N1c1cccc(N2C(=O)C=CC2=O)c1.O=C1C=CC(=O)O1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C14H8N2O4.C4H2O3.C3H6O/c17-11-4-5-12(18)15(11)9-2-1-3-10(8-9)16-13(19)6-7-14(16)20;5-3-1-2-4(6)7-3;1-3-4-2/h1-8H;1-2H;3H,1H2,2H3'], 'amounts': [], 'appearances': []}]",[],[],"['step 1:A 2-liter stainless steel high pressure reactor was charged with 513.88 g of acetone and 0.201 g of N,N′-1,3-phenylenedimaleimide', 'step 2:The reactor was sealed', 'step 3:purged three times with nitrogen gas', 'step 4:Then the temperature was raised to 70° C. during a 40 min period', 'step 4 properties:Time:2400', 'step 4 properties:Temperature:70', 'step 5:reached 60° C.', 'step 5 properties:Temperature:60', 'step 6:111.88 ml of molten maleic anhydride was introduced', 'step 7:At 80° C., separate', 'step 7 properties:Temperature:80', 'step 8:were introduced into the reactor over a period of 3 hours, with the methyl vinyl ether feed', 'step 8 properties:Time:10800', 'step 9:begun 10 min. before the decanoyl peroxide-acetone solution', 'step 9 properties:Time:600', 'step 10:the reactor was maintained at 80° C. for an additional half-hour', 'step 10 properties:Temperature:80', 'step 11:The reactor was then cooled', 'step 12:to provide a thick, viscous light amber colored solution of the desired copolymer product in acetone']"
