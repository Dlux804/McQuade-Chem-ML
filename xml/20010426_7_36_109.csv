Specifically, in the example shown in the reaction scheme, 7-bromo-3,4-dihydro-4,4-dimethylnaphthalen-1(2H)-one (Compound G) is reacted with thiophenol in the presence of titanium tetrachloride and triethylamine in tetrahydrofuran (THF), to provide the intermediate 4,4-dimethyl-7-bromo-1-phenylthio-3,4-dihydronaphthalene (Compound A35).

The resulting solution was warmed to room temperature and stirred overnight. The reaction was warmed to 50° C. for 3 h, cooled to room temperature, and diluted with EtOAc (70 mL). The solution was washed with H2O, saturated aqueous NaHCO3, 10% aqueous HCl, and saturated aqueous NaCl, before being dried over MgSO4. Removal of the solvents under reduced pressure followed by column chromatography afforded the title compound as a colorless oil.']","[{'chemical_names': ['(+/−) ethyl 2-(1-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-4,4-dimethyl-7-bromo-naphthalen-1-yl)acetate'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CCOC(=O)CC1(O)CCC(C)(C)c2ccc(Br)cc21', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C16H21BrO3/c1-4-20-14(18)10-16(19)8-7-15(2,3)12-6-5-11(17)9-13(12)16/h5-6,9,19H,4,7-8,10H2,1-3H3'], 'amounts': ['0.586 mmol', '200.0 mg'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine'], 'identifiers': [], 'amounts': ['0.703 mmol', '86.0 mg'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['acetic anhydride'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CC(=O)OC(C)=O', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C4H6O3/c1-3(5)7-4(2)6/h1-2H3'], 'amounts': ['2.344 mmol', '239.3 mg'], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['title compound', '(+/−) Ethyl 2-(1-acetoxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-4,4-dimethyl-7-bromo-naphthalen-1-yl)acetate'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CCOC(=O)CC1(OC(C)=O)CCC(C)(C)c2ccc(Br)cc21', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C18H23BrO4/c1-5-22-16(21)11-18(23-12(2)20)9-8-17(3,4)14-7-6-13(19)10-15(14)18/h6-7,10H,5,8-9,11H2,1-4H3'], 'amounts': [], 'appearances': ['colorless']}]","[{'chemical_names': ['CH2Cl2'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:ClCCl', 'inchi:InChI=1S/CH2Cl2/c2-1-3/h1H2'], 'amounts': ['4.0 mL'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['EtOAc'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CCOC(C)=O', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C4H8O2/c1-3-6-4(2)5/h3H2,1-2H3'], 'amounts': ['70 mL'], 'appearances': []}]",[],"['step 1:To a solution of (+/−) ethyl 2-(1-hydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-4,4-dimethyl-7-bromo-naphthalen-1-yl)acetate (Compound E47, 200.0 mg, 0.586 mmol) and 4-N,N-dimethylaminopyridine (86.0 mg, 0.703 mmol) in 4.0 mL CH2Cl2 at 0° C. was added acetic anhydride (239.3 mg, 2.344 mmol)', 'step 1 properties:Temperature:0', 'step 2:The resulting solution was warmed to room temperature', 'step 2 properties:Temperature:room temperature', 'step 3:stirred overnight', 'step 3 properties:Time:overnight', 'step 4:The reaction was warmed to 50° C. for 3 h', 'step 4 properties:Time:10800', 'step 4 properties:Temperature:50', 'step 5:cooled to room temperature', 'step 5 properties:Temperature:room temperature', 'step 6:diluted with EtOAc (70 mL)', 'step 7:The solution was washed with H2O, saturated aqueous NaHCO3, 10% aqueous HCl, and saturated aqueous NaCl', 'step 8:before being dried over MgSO4', 'step 9:Removal of the solvents under reduced pressure', 'step 9 properties:Pressure:reduced pressure', 'step 10:afforded the title compound as a colorless oil']"
