The solubility of D vitamins in supercritical or subcritical fluids, e.g. in supercritical CO2 in the temperature range from 40 to 60° C. and a pressure range from 20 to 35 MPa, is known from the literature. The industrial process for the synthesis of vitamin D3 is based on the irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol (DHC), which is produced from cholesterol. DHC is converted by irradiation into previtamin D3 and this is isomerized to vitamin D3 by gentle heating. Moreover, lumisterol and tachysterol are formed when DHC is irradiated.
