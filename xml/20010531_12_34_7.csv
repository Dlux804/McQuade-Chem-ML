At this temperature, 180 ml (0.29 mols) of an approximately 1.6 molar solution of butyl lithium in hexane are added dropwise. By removing the cooling bath, the temperature is allowed to rise to −10°C. The solution of lithium-diisopropylamine thus obtained is again cooled to −78° C. This solution is mixed over the course of 20 minutes with 32 g (0.25 mols) of 1-nitroso-2,2-dimethylpyrrolidine and stirred for a further 10 minutes. Then, 35.2 g (0.25 mols) of 3-chlorobenzaldehyde are added dropwise over the course of 15 minutes, and the mixture is stirred for a further 3 hours at −75°C. To the resulting orange-coloured solution is then added dropwise, over the course of 20 minutes, a solution of 40 ml (0.7 mols) of glacial acetic acid in 80 ml of tetrahydrofuran. The reaction mixture which is now light yellow is warmed to room temperature by removing the cooling bath, and is then poured onto a mixture of 1 litre each of saturated sodium chloride solution and methyl chloride. After shaking out, the aqueous phase is separated and washed twice, each time with 200 ml of methylene chloride. The combined organic phases are washed with 200 ml of water, dried over sodium sulphate and the solvent residues are removed in a vacuum. The crystalline residue is dissolved whilst hot in a mixture of 180 ml of toluene and 270 ml of hexane. Upon cooling, the title substance is obtained in the form of white crystals having a m.p. of 143-144°C.']","[{'chemical_names': ['1-nitroso-2,2-dimethylpyrrolidine'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CC1(C)CCCN1N=O', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C6H12N2O/c1-6(2)4-3-5-8(6)7-9/h3-5H2,1-2H3'], 'amounts': ['0.25 mols', '32 g'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['3-chlorobenzaldehyde'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:O=Cc1cccc(Cl)c1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C7H5ClO/c8-7-3-1-2-6(4-7)5-9/h1-5H'], 'amounts': ['0.25 mols', '35.2 g'], 'appearances': []}, {'chemical_names': ['acetic acid'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CC(=O)O', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C2H4O2/c1-2(3)4/h1H3,(H,3,4)'], 'amounts': ['0.7 mols', '40 ml'], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['2-[(1-[3-chlorophenyl]) (1-hydroxy)methyl]-5,5-dimethylpyrrolidine'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:CC1(C)CCC(C(O)c2cccc(Cl)c2)N1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C13H18ClNO/c1-13(2)7-6-11(15-13)12(16)9-4-3-5-10(14)8-9/h3-5,8,11-12,15-16H,6-7H2,1-2H3'], 'amounts': [], 'appearances': []}]","[{'chemical_names': ['tetrahydrofuran'], 'identifiers': ['smiles:C1CCOC1', 'inchi:InChI=1S/C4H8O/c1-2-4-5-3-1/h1-4H2'], 'amounts': ['80 ml'], 'appearances': []}]",[],"['step 1:is again cooled to −78° C', 'step 1 properties:Temperature:-78', 'step 2:This solution is mixed over the course of 20 minutes with 32 g (0.25 mols) of 1-nitroso-2,2-dimethylpyrrolidine', 'step 2 properties:Time:1200', 'step 3:stirred for a further 10 minutes', 'step 3 properties:Time:600', 'step 4:Then, 35.2 g (0.25 mols) of 3-chlorobenzaldehyde are added dropwise over the course of 15 minutes', 'step 4 properties:Time:900', 'step 5:the mixture is stirred for a further 3 hours at −75°C', 'step 5 properties:Time:10800', 'step 5 properties:Temperature:-75', 'step 6:To the resulting orange-coloured solution is then added dropwise, over the course of 20 minutes', 'step 6 properties:Time:1200', 'step 7:The reaction mixture which is now light yellow is warmed to room temperature', 'step 7 properties:Temperature:room temperature', 'step 8:by removing the cooling bath', 'step 9:is then poured onto a mixture of 1 litre each of saturated sodium chloride solution and methyl chloride', 'step 10:After shaking out', 'step 11:the aqueous phase is separated', 'step 12:washed twice', 'step 13:The combined organic phases are washed with 200 ml of water', 'step 14:dried over sodium sulphate', 'step 15:the solvent residues are removed in a vacuum', 'step 16:The crystalline residue is dissolved whilst', 'step 17:hot in a mixture of 180 ml of toluene and 270 ml of hexane', 'step 18:Upon cooling', 'step 19:the title substance is obtained in the form of white crystals']"
